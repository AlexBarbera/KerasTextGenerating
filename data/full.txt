When I came to, I was in a burning field.

I guess there was a big fire.
The familiar town had turned to ashes and it looked like the remains of a battlefield from a movie.
But that didn't last long either.
The fire had died down by the time the sun rose.
The tall wall of flame had shortened, and most of the buildings had fallen.

...It felt strange, being the only thing in that place that still had its original form.
I was the only one still alive around here.
I must have been really lucky, or my house was built in a very lucky spot.
I don't know which it was, but the point is, I was the only one left alive.

I felt that since I survived, I should live on.
I started walking aimlessly, because I thought it would be dangerous just to stay there.
I wasn't really concerned about getting burned up like the people lying around me.
...Probably because, over and above not wanting to be like them, I had a stronger feeling in my mind.

But still, I had no hope.
It was already a wonder I was still alive, so I couldn't expect to be saved.
I won't survive.
Whatever happens, I won't be able to escape from this red world.
It was such an absolute hell that even a small child could understand it.

And I collapsed.
Was it because there was no air? Was it because no function was left in my body?
Anyway, I collapsed and stared up at the clouded sky.

Everything around me was burned up and I could see many shriveled people.
The dark clouds loomed overhead, telling me it would rain soon.
...That's good. The fire will be put out once it rains.

In the end, I sighed deeply and looked up at the sky.
I say to myself that it hurts.
I say so on behalf of all the people who couldn't even say so.

That was ten years ago.
After that, I was miraculously saved.
My body survived.
But I think all the other things about me burned up and were reduced to ashes.

If you take away a child's parents, home, and all such things, there's nothing left for him.
That's why there was only my body.
I think it's a simple story.
In other words, in order to let my body live...
My heart died.

I'm dreaming.

"Huh!?"
I squint my eyes at the white light.
"So bright", I think.
It was just light entering my eyes when I woke up, but I'm not used to it.
I probably didn't even understand what the bright light meant.

"Huh?"
When my eyes focus, I'm surprised.
I'm lying on an unfamiliar bed, in an unfamiliar room.
I'm surprised, but the room is so white and clean that I feel safe.

"...Where am I?"
I look around.
The room is big and there are many beds.
A person is in each bed, and everyone seems to be hurt.

But nothing feels ill in this room.
Everyone who's hurt is someone who was saved.

I relax and let my eyes wander.

Outside the window,        The bright blue sky was unbelievably beautiful.

After a few days, I finally understood.
I could clearly remember what had happened in the past few days.
Even so, I was no different from a newborn baby.
Not just a metaphor, it was close to the truth.

Anyway, it was a terrible fire.
I had been saved from it, was in the hospital with my body wrapped in bandages, and my parents were gone.
I didn't get the situation, but I vaguely understood that I was alone.
I think I understood quickly.
...Well, there was nothing but children in similar situations around me, so all I could do was absorb the fact.

And after that.
That man came, right when I was beginning to worry what would happen to me next.

He came on the day my bandages were taken off and I was able to eat without help.
Wrinkled coat and uncombed hair.
The man, a bit younger than the doctor, felt more like a big brother than a father.

"Hello. You must be Shirou-kun."
A smile that seems to melt into the white sunlight.
I think it was a suspicious voice, but a very kind voice.

"I'll ask you directly. Which would you prefer? To go to an orphanage, or to be adopted by this man you've never seen before?"
That man was saying he could adopt me.
When I asked him if he was a relative of mine, he said he was just a stranger.
...He looked like an unreliable guy with no future.
But it made no difference, as I knew nothing about either one: him or the orphanage.
So I decided to go with him.

"I see, that's good. Get ready quickly, then. You should get used to your new place as fast as you can."
The guy quickly started packing my stuff.
His packing wasn't very good, even in the eyes of a child.
Then, after making a big mess...

"Oh, I forgot to mention something important.
I have to tell you one thing before you come with me.
Is that okay?"
He turns to me lightheartedly and says,"Yeah.
To start off with, I'm a sorcerer."
He says it in a serious, exaggerated tone.

It happened in an instant.
Come to think of it now, I was really a child back then.
I automatically believed those words.
"Wow, you're awesome."
I guess I said so with bright eyes.

Since that time, I became his child.
Actually, I don't remember what I said back then.
But my father would always talk about that day.
He would remember and retell the story again and again.
So for my father, Emiya Kiritsugu, that might have been the happiest day of his life.

...So.
I guess it was strange for my father to tell me that he was a sorcerer, but I was strange as well for admiring that.
And thus, I became an adopted son, and my last name became Emiya.
Emiya Shirou.
When I said my name, I was really proud of having the same last name as Kiritsugu.

...I'm dreaming.

A story from my childhood.
It was when I finally convinced my father to make me his student, so it must have been about eight years ago.

When I was old enough to stay at home by myself, Kiritsugu started to leave the house on a regular basis.
He would say in his normal tone that he would "travel the world", and he began to act on these words.

That's how it was after that.
It was normal for him to leave the house empty for a month, and he sometimes wouldn't come home for half a year.
The Emiya house is a big Japanese-style house, and Kiritsugu and I were the only ones living there.
I was perplexed in this house at times, as it was too big for a child.

But still, I liked my life here.
Emiya Kiritsugu would come home from his journeys and tell me lots of stories like a child.
And the child who shared his last name would be at home waiting for those stories.
I was always alone in the house, but that loneliness would all fade with the stories he brought back.

The father who was always chasing his dreams like a kid.
His attitude was astounding, but he always seemed dazzling to me.
That might be why I wanted to be like him someday.

...Well, on top of that....
Looking at my ever-dreaming father, I felt I should become reliable myself

...I hear a sound.
I hear a heavy, old, rusty sound as the door opens.

Light enters the dark shed.
"Uh."
My mind, waking up...
"Senpai, are you awake?"
...Feels the cold air and the approaching footsteps.

"...Mm. Good morning, Sakura."
"Ah, yes. Good morning, Senpai."
Sakura smiles and nods as if accustomed to this situation.

"Senpai, it's morning already. You have some more time, but Fujimura-Sensei will get mad if you stay asleep here."

"Oh... you're right. Thanks for coming to wake me up."

"It's no problem at all. You're always up so early.
I can only come and wake you up like this occasionally."
...?
Sakura seems more upbeat than usual today as if she's happy about something.

"...Really? I think you wake me up quite often.
Though, Fuji-Nee always hits me to wake me up, so I'd rather have you wake me up... Well, I'll try harder next time."

...I answer her with a sleepy head.
I don't know what I'm saying with my mind not fully awake.

"All right. But I'm happier when you don't try."
Sakura is giggling.
...Gah, I guess my head was still dozing and I said something weird.

"Give me a second, I'll wake up."

Taking a deep breath, I clear up my mind.
The cold outdoor air helps in situations like this.
The chill works well to beat the sleepiness out of my head.

...In front of me is Matou Sakura, my junior at school.
This place is a shed behind my house, and the time is six o'clock.

"...Senpai?"
;//splitted
"Yeah, I'm awake now. Sorry, I guess I did it again.[l]
I have to help you cook breakfast too."
"It's fine. You were up late last night again, right? So you should take your time in the morning. I'll get breakfast ready."

Sakura says so in a happy tone.
...It's unusual. Sakura really seems to be in a good mood this morning.

"I can't let you do that. I'll get up right now, so let's go to the kitchen together."

"All right, I'm all set. Let's go, Sakura."
"Ah... um, Senpai..."
"Hm? What, is something wrong?"
"No, it's nothing, but... I think you should change before you go back to the house."

"Oh."
That said, I look down at myself.
I fell asleep while I was working, so I'm still wearing my overalls.
Being my work clothes, they're pretty dirty. I can't imagine what Fuji-Nee would say to me if I went into the house like this.

"Ugh... I guess I'm not awake yet. I'm a bit out of it this morning."
"That could be. So you rest here for a bit and I'll take care of breakfast. And you know, if you keep this place a mess, Fujimura-Sensei will get mad at you."

"...You're right. I'll go after I get changed. You go on ahead."
"Yes, I'll be waiting, Senpai."

Sakura leaves.
Well.
I have to change into my school uniform and clear up this mess.

The shed is built on the edge of our yard, and just as it seems, it's a warehouse we put all our junk in.
But for me, it's a place of treasures as I've enjoyed messing with things since I was a kid.

Father didn't allow me to go into the shed, but I always sneaked in here. As a result, it became my base.
For me, Emiya Shirou, I guess you could call this place my real room.
The big Emiya household doesn't suit me, and I can only relax in this space full of junk.

"...Besides, it's a waste. Even if it's junk, you can still use it."
Most of the things in here are appliances that can't be used any more.

Did I bring all the junk in here because I liked the place, or did I come to like it here because of all the junk?
Anyway, since I was always sneaking in here, it became my hobby to fix the broken things.

It's not like I get attached to things.
I think it just annoys me not to use things that can still be used.
And just like that, I was fixing up this stove all last night.

"...I guess I'll finish this tomorrow. It seems I don't have enough concentration, seeing how I fell asleep halfway."
I shake off the feeling of disappointment in myself.
I gather up the parts of the stove and put them on the shelf full of things waiting to be fixed.

There are no spaces on this shelf full of things awaiting repair. An old VCR awaits after the stove.
...I guess I'll ignore the fact that Fuji-Nee broke both of them.

"...All right."
I change into my uniform.
This place is like my room, and it holds changes of clothes along with other things I need.

It also has lots of blueprints and junk, the result of failures from when I do my training.
There's also some kind of old design inscribed on the floor, like an altar or something.

"Well, let's get today started."
Clapping my hands in prayer to the shed, I head for the house.

I emerge from the shed.
The Emiya house is a Japanese-style house on the outskirts of town.
My father wasn't much of a respected person in town, but he somehow still had this huge house.
That on its own is a mystery, but it also seems he didn't have any relatives in Japan.
That's why the house became mine and no one else's when my father died.

Though, to be honest, I don't have that kind of management ability.
Old Man Fujimura is in charge of complicated things like inheritance and property taxes.

Old Man Fujimura is the big landlord in this neighborhood.
According to Father, "the old man's like a yakuza boss".
Of course, this is just prejudice.
He's not "like" a yakuza boss, he "is" a yakuza boss.

"......"
Well, that's a problem in itself, but I prefer to ignore it.

It's certainly true that he's energetic and scary, but he's actually not that bad a person.
It really helps me as he pays a lot when I tune-up the motorcycle he likes to ride.

Anyway, that's why I'm the only one living in this big house.
It's been five years since Father died.
The days have passed quickly.
I sigh, thinking about how much I've grown in those five years.

I've trained every day to be like Kiritsugu, but it's not that easy in reality.
It's natural because I had no talent to begin with, but what can be said about having no improvement at all in five years?
To sum up the present in one sentence, my goal is so far away that I'm not even at the starting line yet.


No, I guess it won't do any good to rush.
For now, I have to do what I can.

Well then.
Right now, I should

1) I'll go and help Sakura.
2) I'll go and finish my daily routine.
That's right, I have to go and help Sakura.
I'd feel bad, both for letting my junior do all the work, and for Sakura coming here so early in the morning.

But I'm too late.
It seems breakfast has already been made.
I can smell the elegant scent of breakfast befitting Sakura.
Sakura has finished cooking and is opening the cupboards. I can see that all she has left to do is set the table.

"I'm sorry. I'll at least get the dishes ready, so you go and sit down."
"Huh? Oh, you're here already, Senpai?"

"Not 'already'. We're usually eating by ten past six, so I certainly slept in."
"I don't think so. You're not in any clubs, so this is still early for you."

"Clubs have nothing to do with this. When you bring clubs into it, the problem is that you come here when you have morning practice to go to."
"Ah... no, I'm doing this because I want to, so please don't worry about my club."

"Yeah, you always say that. That's why I wake up early, clubs or not. It's rude for me to sleep in if you're going to be here."

For me, waking up early is waking up before Sakura gets here, and sleeping in is making Sakura prepare breakfast on her ownlike today.
Though, this has only been a habit for a year and a half or so.

"Anyways, you take a rest. We only have to set the table, so at least let me do that."
I stand next to Sakura and take out the dishes.
Sakura is stubborn at times, and in situations like this, she won't rest unless she's forced to.

"Oh, then I'll help too. I'll load the plates and you can take them out."

"No, I'm saying I'll do it all myself."
"That won't do. You're head of this household, so you should just sit contentedly in the mornings."

"Sit contentedly? A head of household who leaves you to do the work by yourself is a failure. It's okay, so go to the living room."

"That's right, please be a failure. This is repayment for letting me eat good food all the time. So if it's possible, I'd like for you to rest."

"Hey. We're going fifty-fifty on the groceries, so you shouldn't worry about it. I should be the one thanking you. Since you've started coming here, our meals have improved."

"Oh, I knew it. You don't get it, do you Senpai? That's not why the meals here are good."
"Huh? What do you mean that's not why?"

"No, it's nothing. But please take responsibility because I can't eat a pleasant meal anywhere else any more."
Sakura smiles while blushing.

"I-Idiot, don't say such weird things.
What if Fuji-Nee hears that? She doesn't understand jokes."
"You're right. It would be a big problem if Fujimura-Sensei overheard that."
"Right. Don't say so much weird stuff."
"Yes, I won't. I won't say anything. So I can help you, right Senpai?"
"......"
Sakura looks up at me, naturally and calmly.

"Fine, do what you want. If you want to help so much, go right ahead."
"Yes, I'll do as I please."
"...Geez, you really don't listen to anything I tell you anymore, do you Sakura?"
"That's true. Maybe I'm becoming more like Fujimura-Sensei."
Speaking softly, Sakura reaches up for the cupboard.

Her silky hair and smooth skin catch my eye.

...How can I put this... it's troubling.
She must be maturing as she seems really feminine these days.
Her casual movements and her figure are so beautiful that I instinctively look away.

"Senpai? Is something wrong?"
"No, it's nothing. Don't worry, it's nothing."
"Hm?"
...Honestly.
Why am I feeling tense around my friend's sister?
After all, Sakura's not like that.
She's a good underclassman, and a junior I need to take care of.

First of all, the relationship between me and Matou Sakura is just that of a Senpai and a junior.
She's the sister of a close friend of mine, but since she's a grade below me, we weren't that close.

It all changed a year and a half ago into this cooperative kind of relationship.
Sakura came to cook when I was injured, and after that, I think we just ended up like this.

...I think we intended to do it until my injury healed, but some trivial thing came up to make her stay with it.

Anyways, Sakura is a good cook, and perfect at cleaning and doing the laundry.
It's a big help to have her helping around here in the mornings, but it's been a bit troubling recently.
The problem is not in Sakura, but me.


Frankly, Sakura is beautiful.
She's one of the best looking first years, and I'm sure there are lots of guys who want to date her.
And on top of that, she's been growing in certain places recently and some of her casual gestures have started to catch my eye.

...That's what I mean by a small problem.
Maybe I'm just feeling guilty about being attracted to my friend's sister.
Usually I'm fine, but when I'm caught off guard like just now, I blush... does this make me an unsuitable Senpai...?
The Emiya house has a big dojo.
It was built when the house was built.
It was only intended as a hobby, so the dojo wasn't built for any particular purpose.

"Well."
I'll warm up a bit before breakfast.
I'm not really studying martial arts, but since Father told me "if you want to be like me, you'll have to train your body first", it became my daily routine to work out.

"...Ninety-nine, one hundred..."
I finish my routine sit-ups and change out of my gi into my uniform.
I slept in this morning, so I cut short of my workout.
Some sit-ups with no stretching should be enough.
I'm not the kind to build up a lot of muscle, and it's not like I want to get into a fight.

All I need is enough athletic ability to handle sudden accidents, and to move as I wish when I have to.
After all, the thing I want to become is the complete opposite of an athlete.

"...Oh, this late already?"
I put the sweaty gi into the laundry basket.
It's 6:20.
In our house, even this is a late time for breakfast.

Breakfast is already prepared.
I can smell the elegant scent of breakfast befitting Sakura.

"Breakfast is ready, Senpai."
"Yeah, thanks... sorry, you had to do more work because I slept in."

"No, it's no work at all. Besides, you didn't sleep in. This is early for you since you're not in any clubs."

"Clubs have nothing to do with it. When you bring clubs into it, you have to wake up early to come here when you have morning practice."
"Ah... no, I'm doing this because I want to, so please don't worry about my club."

"Yeah, you always say that.
Well, that's why I wake up early, clubs or not. It's rude for me to sleep in if you're going to be here."

For me, waking up early is waking up before Sakura gets here, and sleeping in is making Sakura prepare breakfast on her ownlike today.
Though, this has only been a habit for a year and a half or so.

"Heehee. Senpai, you always put too much weight on these things. Mitsuzuri-Senpai always says you're so honest that it's annoying."
Sakura smiles, as if remembering it.
Mitsuzuri is the captain of the archery club Sakura is in, and someone I have a lot of acquaintance with.

"...Huh. Is she still complaining to you about me?"
"Yes. She's working hard every day to beat you in archery before she graduates."[l]

"...Geez, she must be better than me by now. Is she just glorifying the memories? I don't mind people thinking highly of me, but I guess it depends on who they are."
"Mitsuzuri-Senpai hates losing, so she probably thinks of you as a rival."[l]

Sakura puts rice into a bowl as she talks.
It's almost six thirty.
The archery club's morning practice starts at seven.
It's not mandatory, but she can't afford to take it easy.

"Fuji-Nee... will be here soon, I guess. Well, it's her fault for not getting here on time. Well, Sakura, let's go ahead and start eating."
"Yes. Here you go, Senpai."
Sakura hands me the bowl with a smile.

...Then.
I'm used to this every morning, but her white fingers catch my eye.

"!!"
...How can I put this... it's troubling.
She must be maturing as she seems really feminine these days.
Her casual movements are beautiful and she often takes my breath away.
Perhaps it's a reaction to not feeling anything for her until now, but I'm noticing more and more feminine characteristics in her...

"Senpai? Is something wrong?"
"No, it's nothing. Don't worry, it's nothing."
"Hm?"
...Honestly.
Why am I feeling tense around my friend's sister?
She's a good underclassman and a junior I need to take care of.

First of all, the relationship between me and Matou Sakura is just that of a Senpai and a junior.
She's the sister of a close friend of mine, but since she's a grade below me, we weren't that close.

...That's what I mean by a small problem.
Maybe I'm just feeling guilty about being attracted to my friend's sister.
Usually I'm fine, but when I'm caught off guard like just now, I blush... does this make me an unsuitable Senpai...?
"Issei, you there?"
"I am. You're a bit late today, Emiya."
He must have been studying, as Issei looks up from the paper he's reading.

"Just you, Issei? Where are the others? Shouldn't they be here now as well?"
"No. Unfortunately, our members are very businesslike.
They have their set work hours, and they don't want to come in early or stay late."
"That's why the student council president is doing the routine duties himself, huh? I guess this place has its own problems."

"No, it's the kind of trouble I like. You don't need to pity me."
"Huh? Uh, no, I wasn't pitying you or anything."
"Hm. I'm not happy about that either, but I'll pretend I didn't hear it. It still means that you care."

Issei, who is organizing the papers he was reading, is the big boss of this student council room.
He's the guy trying his best to reform this lax student council, and he's been a friend of mine since first year.
His full name is Ryudou Issei.
Despite his old-fashioned name, he has elegant features and he's really popular with the girls.
And he's also the student council president, so you'd think he'd take to it like a duck to water, but...

"Hm. Hot tea is certainly a good way to start a morning."
He's just sipping tea like this, so he's not that firm.

As you can see, Issei has a plain personality.
It's easily misunderstood, but he doesn't involve himself in love affairs nor engage in normal student recreations.
It's because he's the successor of the Ryudou Temple, up in the mountains.
He's fine with that idea, so there's a good chance he'll shave his head when he graduates.

"So, what am I doing today?"
"Hm? Well, I'd like to let you sit down and take a rest first... but I guess we don't have time. I'll explain as we go, so bring your usual tools and follow me."

"Frankly, our school's budget is completely unbalanced."
"I know. The athletic clubs are favored, so other clubs don't get much, right?"
"Right. As a result, members of the other clubs are in trouble.
I'm working hard to make the budget go to them, but I'm having trouble because it's not clear where the money's going.
In particular, there's no solution for the shortages of heaters during winter."[l]

"I see. Oh, can you hand me the torque screwdriver? The biggest one. And the conductive wire too.
...Yeah, I should be able to fix this."
"Conductive wire? ...Uh, is this it? Sorry, I don't know exactly.[l]
Tell me if I'm wrong."
"You're right. So, what was that about the shortage of heaters? Are there other broken ones?"

"Yes. In the 2nd AV room and the art club. The petitions requesting new stoves are multiplying."
"But there's not enough budget to meet the demand, huh? As I thought, it's just getting old. Good thing it's not broken on the inside."

"...Hm. You think it can be fixed, Emiya?"
"Yup. In cases like this, old things are nice because they're easy to understand.[l]
It's just a shorted connection, so it should last the whole year if we replace that."
"I see! Good job, Emiya. I'm always so pleased when you're reliable."

"You're wording it weirdly, Issei...
Oh, I'll be finished soon, so could you wait outside for a bit?"
"All right, I'll be out of your way."

Issei leaves the room quietly.
...It seems he assumes that I'm going to do something delicate.

"...Well, it is delicate, but..."
I place my hand on the old electric heater.
Usually, even if you're used to fixing things, it's hard to figure out what's wrong with it just by looking at it.
So the fact that I figured it out means what I'm doing is not ordinary.

I block off my vision and look inside the heater with my sense of touch.
In that moment...
An image appears in my head.

"...There are two places where the wire's about to break... The pipe should last a bit longer... Insulation tape should be enough for the power cord..."
...Good, I can fix this with the tools I have with me.

If the pipe were broken, it couldn't be fixed by an amateur.
If that had been the case, I would have had to "strengthen" it in a very unamatuerish way. But in this case, just looking at it will suffice.
That is the "magic" Emiya Shirou learned from Kiritsugu.

"All right, let's begin."
I take the cover off and start to work.
I already know where it's broken, so the rest is easy.
"...Man. This is the only thing I'm any good at."

That's right. Emiya Shirou has no talent for magic.
Though it doesn't make up for it, I think I'm quite skilled at visualizing structures like I did just now.
In fact, when I first figured out a structure and reproduced it, my father looked surprised and said "what a useless ability".

I guess my strong point isn't a useful ability.
According to my father, it's already a waste of effort to perceive the structure with my eyes.
For a real magus, there's no need to understand every corner of a structure like I just did.

They say that the battle of the magus comes in reading the center, the core of things instantaneously, and changing it faster than anything else.
That's why reading the structure is a wasted effort, as even if you do understand the structure, all you can do is determine where magical energy could be more easily transmitted.

So all in all, it turns out that my strong point is just in fixing things like this.
I don't have to open them up to look for damage.
If I can quickly search for broken parts and have the skills to repair them, most things can be fixed.
Though, that's only the case for simple things that can be fixed with "amateur knowledge".

"Done. On to the next one..."
I pack away the conducting wire that I used and go out into the hallway with screwdriver and wrench in hand.

"Issei, the repairs are done."
But.
In the hallway is someone else apart from Issei, a girl.


I'm a bit surprised.
The person talking to Issei is Tohsaka Rin, from class 2-A.
She's a lady who lives in a big mansion on top of the hill, a perfect honor student.
Good looking, smart, athletic, and faultless.
She's intelligent, well mannered, and modest about her looks. People say she's the ideal woman.

So it hardly needs to be said that the guys at my school treat her like an idol.
Though in Tohsaka's case, she's so perfect that she's considered unreachable.
It's commonly believed that only teachers and guys like Issei can even talk to her.

...Well, to be honest, I'm a guy too.
So I'm one of Tohsaka Rin's admirers.

"......"
Tohsaka looks at us as if she's in a bad mood.
It seems to be true that she and Issei don't get along.

"Ah, sorry Emiya. I'm the one who asked for help, but it seems like you're doing all the work. Forgive me."
Wow.
Issei's an amazing man, talking like that and ignoring Tohsaka.

"Don't worry about it. So, where next? There's not much time left."
"Yeah, the AV room is next. It seems it's been working badly for a while, but now it finally died."

"It can't be fixed if it's dead. It would be quicker to just buy a new one."
"...True, but it'd help if you could take a look at it. It might be dead to my eyes, but only faking it to yours."

"I see. Well, let's take a look."
There's only about 30 minutes left until homeroom.
I'll have to hurry if I'm going to fix it.

I start for the AV room with Issei.
But it's impolite to ignore her completely when we've met like this.

I turn back to Tohsaka, who's standing in a daze.
"You're up early, Tohsaka."
I make an honest comment, then follow Issei.

"We barely made it. Thank you, Emiya. I caused you trouble again. I would be a failure as a friend if I made you late doing things for me."
"Don't worry about it. It's no big deal for me to be late. Though I guess it would be for you to be..."
"Indeed. Well, I'm glad we made it."
Issei heads to his seat, relieved.

It's exactly eight o'clock.
The first homeroom bell has rung, so Fuji-Nee should be here in about five minutes.

"Phew."
I'm a bit out of breath since we ran here from the AV room.
Taking a deep breath, I head to my seat.

"You're so noisy in the mornings, Emiya. I was wondering what you'd been doing since quitting the club, but all you've been doing is helping out Ryudou? It's not my concern, but don't do anything to bring the club into disrepute, okay? You're pretty uncommitted after all."

Matou Shinji, a friend of mine from middle school, is standing in front of my seat.
As you can tell from his last name, he's Sakura's brother who's one year older than her.

"Yo. Is the archery club doing well, Shinji?"
"O-Of course...! There's no point in telling an outsider, but it's been peaceful since a certain attention-hog left. We'll do well in the next competition!"

"I see. Mitsuzuri must be working hard."
"Huh? You're talking rubbish. The archery club is doing well because of me. You're just an outsider, Emiya, so you'll just embarrass yourself if you talk like you know about it."

"I see, I'll be careful. But I won't have any concerns with the archery club since I don't have any business there."
I put my bag on the desk and pull out the chair.

"What's that about? You're saying you're not interested in my archery club?"
"I said business, not interest. It'd be weird to go there when I'm an outsider, right?
But tell me if something comes up. I'll help if there's anything I can help with. You weren't good at fixing the bows and bowstrings, right?"

"Oh, thanks. I'll call you if there's any work to be done.
Though I don't think that'll happen."

"Yeah, that's good. You're not captain material if you leave work that needs to be done. Don't give Fujimura-Sensei too much trouble. She's scary when you piss her off."
"...! Huh, mind your own business. You're an outsider, so keep away from the dojo!"

Shinji returns to his seat in his usual manner.
...Hm, he seemed even more irritated than usual today.

"What a guy. How can he talk like that when he's the one who drove you out?"
"Oh, you were here, Issei?"
"What do you mean!? You're so cold, saying that to a friend who was listening in out of concern!"

"Hm? Why would you do that? I'm not doing anything that should make you worry about me."
"Idiot. Of course I'll worry about you. You're the sort to lose your temper easily. Some people would cheer if you beat Shinji up, but all the girls would condemn you. It's not good to let a friend get into a situation like that."

"I see. You're right now that you mention it. Thanks, Issei. I don't think it'll be a problem, but I'm grateful for your concern."
"Yes, well, as long as you understand... but it's strange. You lose your temper easily, but you're tolerant of Matou."
"Yeah, that's just his style. You get used to it if you hang around him for a long time."

"Hm, I see."
"Yeah. If you understand, go back to your seat. Fujimura-Sensei will fly in here any second now."
"Haha. It's more like her to come floating in than flying in."

The homeroom bell rings.
A homeroom teacher usually would come five minutes early, but our homeroom teacher isn't like that.

For class 2-C, homeroom starts one minute after the bell rings. Right when we hear...
"I'm late, I'm late, I'm late...!"
And Fuji-Nee runs into the classroom.

"All right, I made it! Good morning, everyo"
Wham!
Fuji-Nee falls over with a terrible sound.


The classroom is filled with silence, in contrast to the clamor from a second ago.
A sudden change of atmosphere.
Just as you'd expect from Fuji-Nee. Her nickname of "human jet coaster" isn't just for show.

...But that really was a bad hit.
Fuji-Nee is still on the ground, having hit her head on the platform.
You can't see her expression with her head facing the ground, so it gives you a bad mental image.

"...Hey. Front row. Wake her up."
"...What? I don't want to. I'm scared she'll bite me if I go near her..."
"...She's not a Mimic or anything. She won't go that far."
"Hey, if you're saying that, why don't you do it?"
"Uh, I'll pass. I'm not used to this."
"Me neither! And why would you make a girl do it? A guy should do it!"

The front row is getting noisy.
As we're in the middle rows, we can't tell what sort of state Fuji-Nee is in.
We can't tell, so we all stand up to look.

"Hey, she's not moving. Has she passed out?"
Someone asks.
If so, the problem would be how to get her to the nurse's office.

Everyone here is a warrior who has been with Fuji-Nee for the past year.
They probably want to get out of the habit of taking their teacher to the nurse's office.

"Fujimura-Sensei...? Um, are you all right?"
A brave female student calls out to her.
Fuji-Nee doesn't even twitch.
A sense of worry runs through the room.

"...That was a bad fall. She hit her head right on the platform. She'd have to be invincible to come out of that without a scratch."
"Hm. How about getting her for our baseball club?"
"D-Don't even joke about that! The day she's in charge of us, we'd get into the regionals!"
"Fujimura-Sensei, Fujimura-Sensei...! It's no good, there's no response...!"

"Hey, why don't you wake her up since you're in front of her?"
"What!? No way! If she's really dead, I'll be killed!"
"But things could get bad later if we leave her like that."
"But no one wants to go near her."
"...I guess it can't be helped. We'll have to do... that."
"Yeah, that."
"All right."

All our hearts become one.
...Well, not Shinji and I, because we're too scared.

"One, two... wake up, Tiger!"
Even though everyone said it at the same time, it's only as loud as a whisper.
The "Tiger" part is especially quiet.
But still...
...A twitch.
The silent Fuji-Nee reacts.

"Whoa, she moved!? It's working, everyone!"
"All right! Continue the punishment!"
Everyone must be stressed from the impending exams.
Even though they shouldn't, they repeat Fuji-Nee's nickname while waving their arms.

"Wake up Tiger, it's morning!"
"Sensei, you're a tiger if you don't wake up!"
"Don't give up, Tiger! Stand up, Tiger!"
"Yeah, wake up, Sensei! Then you'll be a true Tiger!"
"T-i-g-e-r! T-i-g-e-r!"

"Gahhh!!
Don't call me Tiger...!"

A roar of lightning.
She stands bravely as if the fall has done nothing at all.

"...Huh? What are you all doing? You can't stand up in middle of homeroom. Come on, sit down and I'll get started."
Fuji-Nee stands before everyone in her usual manner.
...It seems all memories from the moment she entered the classroom have fled her head.

"...Hey, it seems Tiger doesn't remember what happened."
"...Lucky. We're really fortunate this morning."
"...Well, I don't know if we can call it 'lucky'..."
Everyone returns to their seats, chatting.

"Huh? Did someone just make fun of me?"
"No, we didn't. Maybe you imagined it?"
"All right, good. Then I'll start homeroom, so listen up."

Fuji-Nee starts homeroom slowly.
She chats in between the announcements, so we don't get through it very fast.

"So everyone, please note the curfew.[l]
It's at six o'clock, so people with club activities shouldn't stay too late either."
"What? Six o'clock is too early, Taiga-Sensei. Can't the athletic clubs be exempted?"

"Nope. And please address your teacher as 'Fujimura-Sensei'. I'll get mad if you call me that again."
"All right, I'll be careful."
He sits down again, not showing any signs of listening to her.

...How stupid of him.
Fuji-Nee gets mad when she says she will. It makes no difference that he's a student and she's a teacher.
He doesn't realize that she just gave him a final warning.

"Well, that's it for today's homeroom. Let's meet again in English class in third period, everyone!"
Fuji-Nee leaves, waving her hand.

She's the teacher responsible for class 2-C, Fujimura Taiga.
Her nickname is Tiger.
You might doubt it, but it really is her nickname.

People like calling her so since she has a name like "Taiga" even though she's a woman. But Fuji-Nee herself hates the nickname.
According to her, it's unfeminine.
But she's that kind of person, so I think it's her own fault she has an unfeminine nickname.

"We're starting class. Day monitor, the bows."
The teacher for the first period enters as Fuji-Nee exits.
It's like this every morning, as Fuji-Nee continues homeroom until the very last minute.

And the classes end like every other day.
There are many kinds of students: ones that go to clubs, ones that hurry home, and ones that stay in the classroom for no reason.
It looks like I won't be in any of those categories.

"Sorry, Emiya, about the rest of the repairs... do you have time today?"
"Well, I do have plans, but..."
It's not like I'm just playing around.
After all, the main reason I quit the archery club is because I wanted to prioritize work.

It's already been five years since Father died, and I decided to start working to pay my living expenses.
If you work a lot, there are some jobs you just can't refuse.

Today's an example.
They're restocking inventory at work, and they asked me to come if I can as any help is appreciated.
But it's certainly not something I have to go to. They're probably just having people come in because they want to party after work.


There are two options.
I

1) I'll go and help out the student council.
2) I'll go to work.
It's something I've started.
I should finish the job I began this morning.

"I'll change my plans. We're finishing the job from this morning, right? Let's finish the repairs before the exams start."
"Thank you. Let's go and look at the patient in the art club then."
"All right. Oh, and clear the people out of the room, will you? I can't concentrate with people watching me."
"Of course. I won't let them get in your way."
Issei quickly walks to the hallway, and I follow him out of the classroom in a hurry.

The sun has already set when we leave the school building.
The school gates are already closed.
It's seven o'clock and way past curfew. But thanks to Issei, we're not in trouble.

"You helped me a lot today. I'll certainly make up for it, so tell me if you need anything."
"Yeah, I'll let you know if something comes up. I don't think anything will, though."
I didn't help him to get something in return, so there's nothing I want from Issei.

"...Geez, I guess it is a problem to be too good a person. It's helpful to have you around, but I can't stand it when other people use you to their liking. Helping others is a good thing, but you should be more picky with who you help. You just help anyone who comes to ask you."
"Hm? Am I that indiscriminate?"
"Yes. And that's just going to let heartless idiots use you as they wish. You're a busy man, so it should be okay for you to decline from time to time."


I can't really tell, but it seems like Issei's worried about me.
I've been called helpful since I was in middle school, as I don't turn down requests for help and don't ask for anything in return.

I guess Issei thinks that's dangerous.
But I'm doing it because I want to, and it's not a problem as I decline things that I think are beyond me.

"It's nothing for you to worry about, Issei. I know myself better than anyone. Besides, helping people is a good thing. It's not something a son of the owner of a temple should be trying to stop."
"But I think you're going so far that it might eventually overwhelm you."

"I'll take your warning. See you tomorrow, then."
"...Yes, I'll see you tomorrow."

Issei leaves, looking discontented.
Issei's house, Ryudou Temple, is up in the mountains. So naturally, our routes home go in different directions.
I feel sorry for Issei, but I should prioritize work.
I didn't promise to be there, but I said I'd do my best to be there, so I should do so.

"No, sorry, Issei. I've got plans, so can we finish it some other time?"
"Plans...? Oh, you must mean your work. Sorry to trouble you. This isn't an urgent matter. Don't worry about me and go to work."

"Sorry. I'll continue first thing tomorrow morning, so can we call it even?"
"Hm? I told you, it's not that important. The urgent stuff was finished this morning. You can finish the rest when you're free, Emiya."
"I see. Then can I finish it when I don't have work?"

"Sure. I'll rely on you again then, Emiya."
Issei says farewell and leaves the classroom.

"Well."
I should hurry off too.
Even though there's no set time to be there, I should head for the neighboring town if I'm going to go to work.

"...Geez, I thought I was only helping out, but they gave me 30,000 yen."
Call it receiving a windfall, I guess.

Copenhagen, the place where I worked today, is like a liquor store and a bar, and a lot of people are needed to restock inventory.
It's a big job that takes at least five people, and it doesn't hurt to have more help.

But the boss just said to everyone in his usual tone,"If you can come and help, please do."
...Completely relaxed about it.

But as it turned out, I was the only one who came, along with the boss and his daughter, Neko-san.

"You idiot! There's no way people will come if you ask like that!"
Neko-san was scolding the boss, but I showed up to be a victim, defying their expectations.
They welcomed me with a cheer, and we decided to clean up the storage area as best we could.

And so, before we realized, two hours had passed and we'd finished restocking the inventory.

"I'm surprised. Shirou, are you some kind of Brownie or something?"
After work, the boss eats a brown cake while being impressed.

"Not at all. I'm just used to heavy jobs and I've worked here long enough to know where things are. I haven't been working here since I was small for nothing, you know!"

"Oh yeah. Has it been five years already?"
"About that long. You were the only ones that would hire me right after my father died."
"Whoa. No wonder I'm feeling old."

He eats his rum cake.
Neko-san is drinking hot sake next to him.
The family is well balanced, as the boss likes sweet things while his daughter likes spicy things.

So.
"But you really helped us out. I can't just give you a cake for all this work, so here's a token of my appreciation."
He hands me three 10,000 yen bills.
A reward unmatched for the three hours of work I did, much more that I would get for even a week's work.

"Oh, thank you."
I hesitate, but decide to accept what I'm given.

And as I'm leaving Copenhagen...
"...Mmm. Hold on, Emiya-n. Who'd you hear about today from?"
Neko-san stops me while curled up in front of the heater.

"Um, I think it was Furukawa-san."
"...Man, that idiot. Don't push your work onto a student. Well, so you came here today even though you didn't have to?"
"Uh... well, it was like, 'come and help if I wasn't busy'."

"Furukawa's an idiot, but so are you.
Oh well. You never turn down anyone asking for help, do you? You took care of the store when dad and I got sick too."

"Hm? I don't think that's true. I don't take impossible jobs. I only accept things I can do."

"...Hm. But you were sick too back then.
I don't really care. But what I'm saying is, you're a good person and a bit stupid, so I'm a bit worried. Tell Fujimura to come and see me from time to time."

Neko-san circles her finger while drinking some hot sake.
She seems to think I'm a firefly or something.

"Okay. ...So, just tell Fuji-Nee that?"
"Right. See ya, don't push yourself too hard."

"...Wow, I'm already past the bridge."
I made it from the neighboring town of Shinto back into Miyama City while I was daydreaming.
Breakfast is placed on the table.
A perfect breakfast consisting of chicken salad, cooked salmon, spinach, radish and carrot miso soup, and yam soup.

Sakura and I bow and start our meal quietly.

The sounds of our chopsticks echo.
Sakura isn't the talkative type, and I'm not versatile enough to talk while eating.

Naturally, mealtimes are quiet.
Usually it's louder, but today, the loud person is...
She must have been watching spy movies last night as she's eyeing us while hiding behind a newspaper.

"Fujimura-Sensei, don't you think you shouldn't read the newspaper during meals?"
"......"

Fuji-Nee ignores Sakura's question.
She's acting weird, but Fuji-Nee always acts in suspicious ways during breakfast.
Sakura must be used to it, as she continues to eat with no particular care.

Sakura prefers to make Western foods.
She learned to cook Japanese food after she started coming here to help.
Fuji-Nee and I preferred Japanese, so Sakura learned to make Japanese food for our breakfast.

Now she's so good that she's almost surpassed me, her teacher.
The salmon is especially good as it's cooked to perfection.
Her miso soup is tasty, and she has shown some capacity even for making yam soup by grinding yams.
Actually, I think this is the first time she's made it.

"Sorry, Sakura, can you pass me the soy sauce?"
"There you... oh wait, Senpai. Your soy sauce is empty."
"Fuji-Nee's will do then. Can you get it?"

"May I, Fujimura-Sensei?"
Fuji-Nee nods.
Her newspaper trembles.

"There you go. Are you going to use it on the yam soup?"
"Yeah, you usually put soy sauce on yam soup, right?"
I put the soy sauce onto the white yam soup.
After stirring it, I put it on the rice and take a bite.

Mm, the stickiness of the yam and the taste of the soy sau
"Ugh...! This is terrible! This is oyster sauce!"
I almost throw it back up.
And then,
"Haha, ahahahahahaha!"
Fuji-Nee throws her newspaper away.

"How's that? It was my plan to switch the labels earlier this morning!"
The female spy throws up her arms to show her happiness.

"W-What are you thinking!? You're always like this even though you'll be turning twenty-five this year!"
"Haha. Did it teach you a lesson for what you did yesterday?
It's divine justice for picking on me with everyone else."

"Divine justice doesn't come from people! I thought you were calm, but this is what you were thinking about!?"

"That's right. That's why I have to go and start grading the exams now. Yup, I should hurry up."
Fuji-Nee sits back down and finishes her breakfast quickly.

"Thank you. Breakfast was lovely as always, Sakura-chan."
"Ah... thank you, Sensei."
"I'm going on ahead then. I'll get mad if you two are late."

And she runs off.
...There's something wrong with a world in which that thing is a teacher.

"...Um, Senpai?"
"Sorry about that. Fuji-Nee didn't really take the time to enjoy your breakfast."
"No, it's not that. Um... did you do something to her yesterday? It's a bit too much for Fujimura-Sensei to play with food."

"Uh... well, yeah. I accidentally called her by her nickname."
"I guess it can't be helped in that case. You didn't apologize to her, did you, Senpai?"
"Sorry. I forgot since it happens all the time."

"You mustn't. Fujimura-Sensei doesn't like you calling her so, Senpai. You made her cry again, didn't you?"
"...I made her run away too. Yesterday's English lesson was a self-study because of it."
And I was awarded a student honor written on note paper, but I threw it away.

"Geez. It was all your fault, then."
Fuji-Nee is like a big sister for Sakura, so she's basically on Fuji-Nee's side.
That's good in its own way, but I wish she'd consider my situation where I have to deal with Fuji-Nee 24-7.

Fuji-Nee was originally an acquaintance of Father's, and she's been coming to the house a lot since I was adopted.
She started to show up even more after Father died, and she's now almost a dependent, eating breakfast and dinner here.

No.
Maybe she's why I was able to make it on my own even after my father died.
Fuji-Nee, Sakura, and I are now the residents of the Emiya household.

...But I'm the only one who knows that my father was a magus.
It's said that magi must hide their identities.
That's why I've been hiding the fact that I'm learning magic ever since I became my father's student.

I say I'm learning, but I can't even cast a single magic spell properly.
With this kind of a skill, it wouldn't make much difference whether I hide it or not. But because it was how my father wanted things, I've trained secretly since then.

I finish breakfast and prepare for school.
I clean the dishes with Sakura while listening to the news on TV.


Sakura is staring at the TV screen.
Over the screen runs an exaggerated teletype reading "Gas Leak Accidents Continue".

It seems there was a big accident in the neighboring town of Shinto.
It happened in a building in the business district. It seems a whole floor of people ran out of oxygen and fell unconscious.
They've called it a gas leak, but this kind of accident is happening often recently.

"Are you worried about the news, Sakura?"
"Eh? No, not really. I just thought it's near... Senpai, your workplace is in the Shinto area, right?"
"Yeah, but it's not really a big place. I don't think an accident like that would happen there."

...But it's not a risk I can completely ignore.
Gas leaks can happen in any building, and on top of that, it hurts to think that hundreds of people are suffering.

It's said that the accidents are happening often because of defective construction work during the rapid development of Shinto.
Whether that's true or not, I certainly don't want any more victims

"...It is dangerous. We'll have to be careful here too."
"Oh, don't worry, Senpai. I check the gas twice every time."

Sakura boasts with pride.
"No, that's not the point."
...Yeah, I've thought so before, but Sakura is a bit off too.

"Senpai, did you lock the back door?"
"I did. I bolted it. Is there a problem?"
"Not at all. Then I'll lock the front door now. When will you be home today, Senpai?"

"I think I'll be a bit late. What about you, Sakura?"
"I'll be back at the usual time. I'll probably be here earlier, so I'll start getting dinner ready."
"...Yeah, that'll help. I'll try to come home early too."

We lock the gate.
Sakura and Fuji-Nee also have keys to my house, and the rule is that the last person out locks up.
"Let's go. You won't make it to morning practice unless we hurry."
"Yes, let's hurry then, Senpai."

We walk down to the town together.
Passing the long wall and going downhill, we reach the residential district.
My house is on top of the hill, far away from the center of town.

Going down the hill takes us to the residential district, and beyond that...
We reach the crossroads at the center of this town.

From here, there are many roads: a big bridge leading to the neighboring city...
...A hill road that leads to Ryudou Temple...
...The residential district on the other side of town...
...The shopping district Sakura and I always use...
...And the school we're headed to right now.

We head for the school without stopping elsewhere.
We don't talk much as we walk up the hill.
Since it's still seven o'clock, there aren't many others on the road.
Other than us, all you can see are a few others heading to their morning practices.

"Well, see ya. Have fun at your club."
I part with Sakura at the school gate like usual.
Sakura's in the archery club, so we have to part here in the mornings.

"......"
But today, Sakura doesn't go.

"Sakura? Are you not feeling well?"
"...No, that's not it, but... um, would you like to come to the dojo?"

"No, I've no business there. Anyways, Issei asked for me, so I have to go to the student council room today."

"...I-I see. Sorry for troubling you then."
Sakura bows.
"Hm?"

"I'll be going now. Please look forward to dinner tonight."
Sakura runs off like she's ashamed of something.
"...?"
Hm? I wonder what that was all about...?
I walk through the moonlit town.
Walking up the road, I notice that there aren't any people around.

The time is around seven-thirty.
There should be people around at this time, but there's no sign of anyone.

"...Oh yeah."
There was some crime here in Miyama City a few days ago.
A burglar murdered someone, I think.
That must be why there's no one around and why the school curfew became six o'clock.

"...Gas leaks and murder, huh? It's been getting dangerous lately."
No wonder there are fewer people walking around at night.
It's getting too dangerous to let Sakura go home on her own.
Sakura's house is in the residential area on the other side of town.
Starting tonight, I should walk her hom

"...Huh?"
For a moment, I can't believe my eyes.
There is someone on the road which I thought was empty.
The person is standing above me as if looking down at me.


Without realizing it, I hold my breath.
The silver-haired girl smiles and descends the hill without a sound.

As she passes...

"You'll die if you don't summon it soon, Onii-chan."

She says something strange.

I go up the hill and reach my house.
As the lights are on, Sakura and Fuji-Nee must be home already.

I smell dinner the moment I enter the living room.
At the table are Sakura and Fuji-Nee, in the middle of dinner.
It seems the main dish tonight is chicken in cream, and Fuji-Nee, who loves white sauce, is in a good mood.

"Welcome home, Senpai. We're sorry for starting without you."
"Sorry I'm late. I wish I could have come home earlier."
"No, you made it. Could you wait a bit? I'll get your dinner ready right away."
"Yeah, all right. I'll go and wash my hands, so make sure Fuji-Nee doesn't eat my food."
"Yes, I will."

I return to my room.
It's a fairly empty room compared to the shed, but since I don't have any hobbies, I think it's quite decorated.
Most of them are random things Fuji-Nee has left here, though.

I wash my hands, change, and return to the living room to find my dinner ready.

"Itadakimasu."
"I hope it is to your liking..."
Sakura is terribly modest.

Her cooking skills have vastly improved in the past year.
She has me completely beaten at Western-style foods, and I can barely beat her at Japanese food. Neither of us have touched Chinese.
I'm pleased my pupil is getting better, but it's kind of depressing when the teacher is defeated by the student.

"Mmm."
It's as good as I expected.
Chicken becomes harder the longer you cook it, so it's juicier and tastier if you roast it before cooking it even though it's tedious.
That's done perfectly here. It's a master's skill, forever beyond the clumsy Fuji-Nee.

"How is it, Senpai...?  Um, I think I did quite well today..."
"It's perfect. The sauce is great too. I guess you have me completely beat when it comes to Western food."

"Yeah, meaty food is much better since Sakura-chan started cooking."
With that.
Fuji-Nee, who had been preoccupied with her food, lifts up her head.

"Oh, Shirou. A student mustn't come home this late."
...Ack.
It seems she's in a bad mood now that she's seen my face, even though she was happy because of dinner.

"Geez, I bet you were helping someone again. That's good, but at least come home early at times like this. I even told you it was dangerous in homeroom.
I said it for your sake, you know?"[l]

"...Uh, can't you tell me that at home instead of in homeroom?"
"You wouldn't listen if I told you here. It's more effective if I tell you at school."
"...Sensei, I think that's abusing your authority. You shouldn't mix work and private life."

"No, it's not enough for Shirou unless I go that far.
He's always on the losing side because he's the one helping everyone else. He should at least come straight home and relax sometimes, that idiot."
"Hey, what do you mean by idiot? I'm not on the losing side if I help someone and they're helped by it."

"...Man. I wonder if you got that from Kiritsugu-san. I worry because you're like that."
I don't exactly know how she's worried, as she's energetically munching down her dinner.

"...Um, Fujimura-Sensei. From what you said, has Senpai been like this since he was small?"
"Yup, he's always been like that. He's the type that goes to help people in trouble. But he's not meddlesome, he's just a bit precocious."

Fuji-Nee laughs dangerously.
"Fuji-Nee, I'll get mad if you say too much. You too, Sakura. Don't ask such boring questions."

I glare at them.
Fuji-Nee clicks her tongue and backs down, but...
"Fujimura-Sensei, please continue."
Sakura is taking the lesson seriously.

"Then I shall. See, Shirou is a person who can't ignore someone in trouble. It's like helping the weak and defeating the strong. In the essay he wrote as a child, he said 'My dream is to become a superhero'."


...She's talking about things from so long ago.
But it's all true, so I don't interrupt.
Anyways, becoming a superhero is a goal I must not stray from even now.

"Wow. Senpai was a real kid."
"Yeah, he was some kid. He would go and help girls being picked on by much older kids, and he'd do the chores around the house because Kiritsugu-san wouldn't.

Man, he was so cute and innocent back then, so why did he grow up so crooked?"

"Probably because of you. Kids think a lot when they see bad adults. Learn to make your own dinner before you say anything like that."
"Wha..."
Fuji-Nee crumbles.
I thought she might drop her head and repent, but...

"Uhh, Onee-chan is sad. Sakura-chan, can I have another bowl?"
Fuji-Nee asks for her third bowl.
Relaxing after dinner, it's almost nine o'clock.

"Well, what shall I do?"
There's some time before my evening training.
I should

1) I`ll take Sakura home.
2) I`ll play with Fuji-Nee.
3) I`ll rest.
...Well, it might be fun to see how Fuji-Nee is doing.
"Yeah, if I get a chance, I'll get her back for telling Sakura those stories."

"Hm? What, weren't you taking a bath?"
Fuji-Nee is silently peeling oranges.
On the table are two orange skins shaped like flowers.

"......"
Is it some curse that she can't even skin an apple, but she's rather talented at artistically peeling oranges?

"I decided to take it later. I just wanted to complain about those stories before I took a bath."
"What? Come on, it's such an old story, and Sakura-chan was happy to hear it too. Instead of that... here, finish your quota. You should eat one a day."
She takes an orange out of a small box and throws it to me.

"Whoa... hey, I won't be bought off with just an orange.
Thank God it was Sakura. Don't tell that story at school, okay? People like Issei would worry."

"I think Mitsuzuri-san would laugh... but I know, I won't tell anyone except Sakura-chan about your childhood."

"I'm saying, don't tell Sakura either. She'll just be bothered if you tell boring stories like that.  ...Well, I don't think it'll happen again, but I'll get mad if it does."
I glare at Fuji-Nee to show her that I'm serious.

"Ohh, I see. I understand. So that's how it is, huh?"
But Fuji-Nee just grins widely and she seems very pleased.

"...Oh, now you're pissing me off. What are you inferring, you stupid tiger?"
I glare at her stupid face.

"I don't care if I'm a tiger. I'm right, aren't I? You didn't want Sakura-chan to know, right?
You wouldn't care if everyone else found out you wanted to be a superhero, but you're embarrassed about Sakura-chan knowing."
"Wha"
I-I don't think so....

"Yeah, in that case, I'll tell her more.[l]
I guess you finally started to notice Sakura-chan, huh?
I'm worried as a teacher, but I'm quite relieved as your guardian."

She says so with great emotion, then she throws a whole orange into her mouth.
Fuji-Nee can eat things as big as her fist in one bite.
I guess it'd be an attractive quality somewhere in the Savanna, but I don't think an older woman needs such wild charms.

"Huh? Senpai, weren't you taking a bath?"
And Sakura, finished with the dishes, comes into the living room.

"Yeah, I put it off since I wanted to tell Fuji-Nee something. Sakura, you want an orange?"
I reach for the stack of oranges.
It's a strange turn of events, but staying here with them should be fun too.

"Oh, I got some from Fujimura-Sensei just now. They were really good."
"Sakura-chan can't eat fresh fruit.
So she won't eat it unless you cook it or freeze it like ice cream... oh, is it almost time?"

"Yes. I'm done cleaning up, so I'll be heading home for today."
"I see. Then I guess I'll leave too. Let's go, Sakura-chan. It's getting dangerous outside lately, so I'll walk home with you."

Fuji-Nee ceases her mass consumption of oranges and stands up.
Her actions are almost those of a responsible elder.

"Uh... is that all right, Sensei?"
"Of course. I'm in charge of you two, so I have to see you home. That's okay with you, right, Shirou? You'll lock up the house and go to bed after we leave, okay?"

"All right. With Fuji-Nee, you should be fine even if a molester or a bear jumps out for you."
"I don't know about that. I don't think I'd be able to beat a bear. ...No, I can't. So if that happens, I'll run back here. Then we can beat it up together and have bear stew tomorrow."

Fuji-Nee smiles confidently.
...Yeah.
Fuji-Nee usually does her own thing and causes havoc, but when she's acting as a teacher, she's a very responsible person.

"Let's go, Sakura-chan. See you tomorrow, Shirou."
"Yes. Good night then, Senpai."
"Yeah."
They leave the house.
I follow them out to the entrance and lock up the house as Fuji-Nee instructed.
Yeah.
I'll take a brief break in preparation for the training tonight.

"The bath's ready and I can ask Fuji-Nee to take Sakura home."
Now that I've decided that, let's do things efficiently.
First, I'll wake up Fuji-Nee who's asleep in the living room. Then, I'll thank Sakura for dinner, see them both off, and take a bath
I haven't thanked Sakura for dinner yet, so I'll go and talk to her.

"Yeah, it's getting late, so I should walk her home too."

Sakura is in the living room getting ready to go home, having finished the cleaning.
"Huh? Weren't you taking a bath, Senpai?"
"No, I'll take it later. I'll take you home first."

"Eh... take me home?"
"Yeah. It's getting dangerous outside lately, so I'm going to walk you home. Your house is far away. Let me at least do this since you're coming here."

"......"
Sakura falls into an awkward silence.
...Did I say something bad?

"...I'm sorry. I appreciate your concern, but you should stay here. I'm used to going home, so I should be fine by myself."
"Well, that may be true, but it's getting dangerous these days. So I'll walk you home for a bit."

"...But, um... if Nii-san sees you, you'll be in trouble too."
"Oh..."

...That's right.
Sakura's brother, Shinji, doesn't approve of Sakura coming to my place.
He can't object too strongly because she says she's going to Fuji-Nee's house, but it could be a problem if I take her home.
...I don't care about getting falsely accused myself, but it's not good if Shinji takes it out on Sakura.

"But I can walk you part of the way, right? We shouldn't run into Shinji between here and the intersection."
"......"

Sakura is silent.
Considering Sakura, she must not be able to lie to Shinji if I take her home even part of the way.
"Oh, then"

"Shall I walk you home?"
A tiger-striped English teacher appears.

"That's getting the lamb out after the lion. When I say it's dangerous for a girl to be out at night, adding another is just..."
...No.
It's a mistake to call Fuji-Nee a girl.
For starters, she doesn't head the archery club for nothing. Her fifth dan kendo skills are dangerous in many ways.

"...I guess Fuji-Nee will be fine. You should be able to fight off any molester."
"Right. So there's no problem with me taking her home. Is that okay, Sakura-chan?"
"Yes, if that's all right with you, Fujimura-Sensei."
"It's decided. Let's go then. I was thinking I should head home too."
Fuji-Nee starts to walk off, taking Sakura's hand.

"Oh. Hang on, Sakura."
"Hm? What is it, Senpai?"
"Dinner was good. Thanks for everything."
"......"
"Yes. I'll do my best again next time if you don't mind, Senpai."
Saying so with a big smile, Sakura leaves the living room.

"......"
I know I'm blushing.
...It's troublesome as Sakura surprises me a lot these days.
Time flies. She was just a junior before. Now, she's a female junior to me.

...How pitiful of me.
Sakura's like family to me, so I can't accept this change.
I haven't thanked Sakura for dinner yet, so I'll go and talk to her.

"Yeah, it's getting late, so I should walk her home too."

Sakura is in the living room getting ready to go home, having finished the cleaning.

"Huh? Weren't you taking a bath, Senpai?"
"No, I'll take it later. I'll take you home first."
"Eh... take me home?"

"Yeah. It's getting dangerous outside lately, so I'm going to walk you home. Your house is far away. So let me at least do this much since you're coming so far."
"......"
Sakura falls into an awkward silence.
...Did I say something bad?

"...I'm sorry. I appreciate your concern, but you should stay here. I'm used to going home, so I should be fine by myself."

"Well, that may be true, but it's getting dangerous these days. So, I'll walk you home for a bit."
"...But, um... if Nii-san sees you, you'll be in trouble too."

"Hm."
That's right.
Sakura's brother, Shinji, doesn't approve of Sakura coming to my place.

He can't object too strongly because she says she's going to Fuji-Nee's house, but it could be a problem if I take her home.
It's a problem, but so what.
I don't care what Shinji says. It's a much bigger problem if Sakura has to walk home alone at dangerous times like these.

"I don't care what trouble I get into. It's dangerous these days, so I'm walking you home."
"Um, I'd feel bad letting you do that..."
"It's fine. You're always helping me out, so let me at least walk you home. Or do you want to go home on your own?"

"Eh? No, it's not that, but..."
"Then it'll be fine. I'm confident in my skills. I should be able to fight off most assailants, so you should make use of me at times like this. I'll protect you, whatever happens."
I nudge Sakura towards the hallway with a glance.

"Senpai...? Is it really okay? You might get into a fight with Nii-san again."
"I don't care. It's only right for guys to fight, and it's best when we talk honestly like that.
He doesn't like to hide things, so it's best if he just comes out with any complaints he has."
Sakura looks surprised for some reason.

"What? Did I say something strange?"
"No, you didn't. I'm just glad you're such good friends with Nii-san."
"Hm? No, I don't think that's right. I'm probably the only one who feels better from it, and it might be the opposite for Shinji."

"Perhaps. But you know, Nii-san always talks to you no matter many times you two fight. He probably finds it hard to deal with you, but he likes you more than other people, so he's always concerned about you. He's not honest, so he likes people he doesn't like."

"...Uh. I can't really reply to that."
"Yes. I envy you, so I thought I'd trouble you a bit."
Sakura smiles.

"Uh...."
Seeing that smile, I hold my breath without realizing it.
Would you call that a big smile?
I think it's the first time I've seen her smile like that.

"A-Anyway, I'm taking you home. I don't care if Shinji sees me. I walked his sister home, so he shouldn't be complaining."

"You're right. It might be better to do it that way rather than to hide it. Then could you, Senpai?"
"Of course. I'll act like your Senpai for once."
I smack my chest.
Sakura smiles warmly at my gesture of "trust me".

We go down the hill and reach the intersection.
There's no one around, and the familiar residential district feels desolate.


It's not even ten o'clock yet, but the town is asleep.
...The silence is strange.
Even though there have been nasty incidents, should night really steal this much life?

"Senpai...? Uh, my house is this way."
"Huh? Oh, sorry, I was just thinking. Your house is the very top one on that side, right?"
"No, the top one is Tohsaka-Senpai's house. My house is up there too, but not at the top."

"Oh, was that it? ...Wait, by Tohsaka, you mean...?"
"Yes, Tohsaka Rin of the second year. Do you not like her, Senpai?"
She must have read my reaction, as her comment is accurate.
Ugh... was I making that kind of a face?

"No, I don't dislike her. I've never talked to her, so I don't know much about her. But she's famous, right? She stands out wherever she goes, so I know her just like everyone else."
"......"

"What about you, Sakura? You have the same Western-style mansion, so do you guys have a neighborly relationship?"
"No. We're certainly neighbors, but her house is up on top of the hill.
But how did you know her house was Western-style, Senpai?"
Sakura asks quietly.

"Oh, it's just something I heard. Something about Tohsaka's place being a haunted house and all that. A haunted house has to be a Western-style house, right?"

"That's true. It seems Tohsaka-san and the house itself like to be alone. When I was a child, I was told that a scary sorcerer lived up on the hill."

"A scary sorcerer, huh? I heard rumors like that too. Though, saying that, all Western-style houses seem to have sorcerers living in them.[vr]
So, did you believe the story, Sakura?"

"I did, because I was small. That's why I always thought I shouldn't go up to the top of the hill."
Sakura answers my joking question seriously.

We go up the hill.
It's a residential district rather opposite to mine, but the habits are the same.

There are fewer and fewer buildings and more trees as you ascend the hill.
It's only natural, as most of the town's facilities are at the bottom of the hill.
In all that, one of the few buildings near the top of the hill is Sakura's house.

"Oh..."
Sakura stops suddenly.
"Hm? Did you forget something?"
"Oh... no, it's not that, but... Senpai, is there someone standing near my house?"
She looks around uneasily.

"Hm?"
I look around too, but there's no one here except us.

"There no one... did you see something?"
"Oh... no, if you didn't see anyone, then it's fine. I've been noticing a strange person around my house recently, so I just wondered if he'd be here again today."

"What? Isn't that a bit dangerous?[l]
What kind of guy was he?"
"Um... he was a blond, good-looking person. He looked like a model, so I'm sure you'd be surprised too if you saw him."
Sakura says so with a blush, as if recalling him.

"......"
...Sakura.
I don't know if that's something I should be worried about.

"Oh, so it's not like he's suspicious?"
"...I don't know. It's just that no one has moved here recently, so I thought it was strange."

"...Hm. Well, it is a bit strange. All right, if you see him around again, tell me or Shinji. We'll get him and make him tell us what he's up to."

"Yes, I'll be counting on you. But please don't do anything rough. I don't want you to get into a fight."
Sakura says so while smiling straight at me.

"...Uh. I-It's all right. I'll ask questions first, so you shouldn't worry about it."
I look away from Sakura's smile as I answer.

"......"
...Geez.
Sakura's gestures captivate me often these days.
It would have been nothing a while ago, so I feel like I'm acting weird.

Maybe it's because Sakura has grown, or maybe just because I finally noticed it.
...Well, I do think Sakura has become really beautiful.
That on it's own is great, but I don't think it's cool for a Senpai to have to be careful where he's looking.

"Good night then, Senpai. I'm glad you walked me home."
"I-Idiot. Don't thank me. You're the one making me dinner, so I should be the one thanking you."
Sakura just smiles with satisfaction.

"...Geez. If this is all it takes, I'll make a habit of it from tomorrow."
"Please do. It's fine if you only do it once in a while when you feel like it, but please do walk home with me. Nii-san will get mad, but I like being with you."

"Senpai, see you tomorrow! Thank you for today!"
Sakura calls back enthusiastically and disappears into her house.

"Well."
I should head home too.
I left Fuji-Nee at the house, and to be honest, that's what worries me.
"...Huh?"
Did I just hear something?

...I can hear it.
The sound of a creaking swing.
It takes me a while to realize it's the sound of some bug.

"...I wonder what kind of bug it is? It's well out of season, certainly."
I imagine a longhorn beetle in the dark, under the cold winter sky.

Then, I notice.
"...Huh? There are three rooms with lights on."
The one that just lit up is Sakura's room.
...The light on the first floor is Shinji's room, so what's the light from the third room?

"...? Only Shinji and Sakura should be living in that place..."
Maybe it's a guest, or Shinji's in that room.
Anyway, I've been here many times, but this is the first time I've seen the light on in that room.

"......"
Well, it's a big house.
It's not strange for a light to be on somewhere in such a house.
It's not strange, but....
"...What's this? I still feel uneasy."
I feel something, like a presence or a bad feeling.

In the cold air, the unseasonal sound echoes.
If there's such a thing as a hunch...
The bug hidden in the bushes feels very ominous.
And so, the day ends.
Just before midnight, Emiya Shirou must carry out his daily routine of using "magic".


I stretch out and adjust my breathing.
I try to empty my mind.
I ignore everything around me and pay attention only to what is inside me.

"Trace, on."
As if to hypnotize myself, I murmur the spell I'm long accustomed to.
No, I really am hypnotizing myself.
As I have no Magic Crest and no knowledge of magic, a spell is only a change to myself.

...Normally, there are no lines in a human body to allow the passage of magical energy.
To artificially change my body to create such a line, I need enough concentration to unify my whole body and every nerve within it.

Magic is a battle with yourself.
For instance, at this very moment, I am inserting a burning steel rod into my backbone.
This metal rod is the only "Magic Circuit" I can prepare for myself.
When I insert it this deep into my body and connect it to the other nerves, I can finally become a magus.

This is not a metaphor.
In reality, something like a burning tong which cannot be seen or felt is being inserted into my backbone.

I am a sorcerer.
Emiya Kiritsugu, the man who said so, was really a magus.
A living magus who performed many marvels and had touched the very structure of the world.
As a young child, I admired him and asked him to teach me magic.

But you cannot become a magus just through effort. It requires born talent and appropriate knowledge.
And of course, I have no talent, and Kiritsugu taught me nothing of magic.
He said something about me having no need of such knowledge.

I still don't know what he meant by that.
But still, it didn't matter to me back then.
I thought that if I could use magic, I could be like him.

But I was not born with talent: no strength of Magic Circuit, no accumulated works of magic handed down for generations.

The work of magic Kiritsugu possessed, the Magic Crest passed down the Emiya family, can only be passed on to a blood relation.
A Magic Crest forces a rejection on those with no blood relation.
So, as an adopted son, I could not receive the Emiya family's Magic Crest.

Well, anyways.
As I don't even know what a Magic Crest is, it doesn't matter if I have one or not.

So now, all it comes down to is training what I can do.
If I want to be a magus, I have to learn magic fit to my nature.

To be blunt, magic is a way to release one's magical energy.
You could say that magical energy is my life force.
It is divided into two forms: a large source, "mana", floating around the world, and a small source, "odo", created inside oneself.

It goes without saying that the large source is superior to the small one.
The power of "mana" is on a completely different level from "odo".
Whatever the form of the magic, a spell using the large source far exceeds one using only one's own power.

That is why superior magi excel at drawing magical energy from the world.
It's like a filter.
A magus turns his body into a filter, sucks up the mana from the world around him, and changes it into something he can use.
This filter is what we call a Magic Circuit.

This is the talent one is born with, and the number of the Magic Circuits within you is determined the moment you are born.
A normal human being does not have many Magic Circuits.
To begin with, there are always very few.
That is why magi pile them up generation after generation, making their children more suitable to use magic.
I hear some families go too far and increase the number of Magic Circuits by selective breeding.

...Well, since I was raised in a normal family, I don't have many Magic Circuits.

So that leaves only one method open to me.
According to Kiritsugu, every person has at least one form of magic they are fit for.
He said something about drawing out magical energy appropriate to their "origin", but I didn't really understand.
All I know for sure is that even I have some magic I can use, and if I train that magic, I may be able to become like Kiritsugu.

That is why I learned only that magic.
That was eight years ago.
After a lot of thought, Kiritsugu finally accepted me as his student.

Listen, Shirou. To learn magic is to stray away from common sense. You die when you die, and you kill when you must.
Our essence is not in life but in death. Magic is only a way to destroy yourself

I guess I had no fear as a child.
Kiritsugu smiled bitterly, putting his hand on the nodding Emiya Shirou.

What I will teach you will bring you conflicts.
That is why you must not use it in front of people, and you must not cease your practice even though it is difficult to learn.
Well, I don't really care if you break that one.
The most important thing is that magic is something you use not for yourself, but for others. If you do that, you may become a magic user, but you will not become a magus

...I guess Kiritsugu didn't want me to become a magus.
I don't care about that.
I don't admire a magus. I admire Kiritsugu.
If I can become like Kiritsugu and be there for someone like on that red day, that will be

"!"
I'm thinking needlessly.
I feel the iron rod in my backbone slide into place.

"Uh, gah...!"
If I lose control of my breathing now, it would be a fatal mistake. The artificial Magic Circuit will eat away my body and destroy it.
If that happens, I'll die.
I would be only an amateur, failing such an elementary step...

I grind my teeth and resume the connection.
After a battle like walking on needles, the iron rod finally arrives deep within me and fuses with my body.
...This process took me about an hour.
After that much time, I'm finally able to make one artificial circuit... one circuit that produces magical energy.

"Basic structure, analyze."
After that, it becomes a process of naturally flowing magical energy.
Emiya Shirou is no magus.
He is only a magic user, who can create magical energy within his body and channel it into objects.

So there's only one magic possible.
Which is...

"Composition, analyze."
Strengthening objects.
It is a magic of "strengthening" that reinforces the object's abilities by understanding the object's structure and channeling magical energy into it.

"Basic structure, alter."
Before me is a metal pipe.
I will channel magical energy into it, perform the simplest magic, and reinforce its durability.

Basically, channeling your magical energy into something other than yourself is like pouring poison into that object.
It is just as the blood of Emiya Shirou is not the blood of the metal pipe. Pumping different blood only accelerates its breakdown, it certainly wouldn't strengthen it.
To prevent that and to turn the poison into a tonic, one must completely understand the structure of the target and channel the magical energy into small open spaces.

"...Composition, reinforce."
...It must be easy for a skilled magus, but for me, who cannot even create sufficient magical energy, it's as hard as hitting a target hundreds of meters away.
The usual target in archery is 27 meters away.
How much harder it is at many times that distance, goes without saying

"Guh...!"
The heat in my body quickly escapes.
The burning pillar in my backbone disappears, and the lungs stretched to the limit demand air.

"Haa... haa, haa, haaaaa....!"
I arc my back to hold off the daze almost making me pass out.

"Ah... dammit, I failed again..."
There's no change in the metal pipe. It seems that the magical energy I poured into it has evaporated into the air.

"...It's hard to improve something that already has form."
The thing I'm attempting is like adding something to an already complete work of art.

Adding to a complete object risks making it less perfect.
Adding unnecessary things will actually decrease the value.
That is why the magic of "strengthening" is simple yet difficult, and only a few magi use it willingly.

...It's not like I use it willingly either, but it can't be helped as this is the only thing I'm good at.
It would be much easier if I could just form something out of clay and use it instead, but a substitute in appearance doesn't have the internal structure to match.

The junk around here is a good example.
When I fail with strengthening magic, I make some substitute objects to practice and to calm down, but they all end up with nothing inside.
I can visualize something's structure easily, so I can make the outside look like the original. But it's empty inside, and of course, it doesn't do anything.


I wipe the sweat off my brow.
Now that I think about it, I realize my whole body is sweating like I've been drenched with a bucket of water.
...But I'm lucky it just ended like this.
That was really bad.
If I'd taken a second longer to recover myself, I would probably have destroyed most of my body.

"...If I improved every time I came closer to death, there might be some hope..."
It's not even that easy.
But it is true that you won't improve your magic if you're scared of death.

As long as you study magic, death is always right beside you.
Even a simple magic repeated every day can go off with a simple mistake, taking the caster's life.

The first step of a magus is to accept death.
Kiritsugu said so sadly.
Maybe he meant that he didn't want me to take such a step.

"...Saving someone means not saving someone else. A superhero is really selfish, huh...?"
Kiritsugu said that to me when I told him I wanted to be just like him.
I still don't know what he meant.
But Emiya Shirou has to become a superhero who goes around saving people, just like Emiya Kiritsugu.

"...But I still can't even do basic things like this. Why do I get distracted by needless things at the most important times? I'm so stupid."
It's not enough to understand the structure of an object with mere vision.
A skilled magus only detects what's important and channels magical energy without waste.

'My dream is to become a superhero.'

I remember what Fuji-Nee said during dinner.
I don't think it's embarrassing nor impossible.
It's already determined. Emiya Shirou will succeed Emiya Kiritsugu.

That's why even though I'm inexperienced, I've done everything I can.
I don't know what kind of a person a superhero should be.
So I can only approach it by helping others within the limits of my abilities.

I have aimed straight for that goal for the past five years, but when things just go wrong like this, I do have doubts.
"...Geez, I don't get it, Father.
How can I become a superhero?"

I look up at the sky through the window.
It's not like I can just randomly do good deeds.
I think being a superhero is different from just helping others.
I know that, but the question is, how can I become one?
The difference between the two is the thing I've failed to understand for the past five years.

...My awakening is dark.
Perhaps I just don't dream much, but unless something really special happens, I always seem to have the same dream.

...What I imagine are swords.
I don't know why it is, but this is the only thing that comes into my mind.
There's no meaning or reason to it.
It may just be one of the aspects making up Emiya Shirou.

There are no dreams to dream.
The only things I recall from sleep are things I was taught a long time ago.
For example, about magi.
Even if I'm an amateur, if I'm a magus, it's only natural for me to understand the kind of world I live in.

To put it simply, a magus is an exception in conflict with modern society.
But even exceptions must band together to survive.
Father told me that the group of magi is called the "Magic Association".
...He also said that I shouldn't associate with them.

The group called the Magic Association hides magic and organizes magi.
They basically keep watch to see that magi do not affect society with magic, but the strange part is that they do not prohibit misuse of magic.

According to Kiritsugu, the Magic Association is only interested in the concealment of magic.
Even if a magus carries out his research at the expense of the lives of many ordinary people, the Magic Association will not punish him.
Their priority is that magic should not become public, so they do not ban magic.
So, they're crazy people who think you can do anything as long as you don't get caught.

Anyway, the surveillance of the Magic Association is thorough.
Most magical research would cost the lives of ordinary people, and as a result, the existence of magic would become public.
So, the Association does not allow research that would harm society.

So magi stay at home and research quietly, while the normal world carries on unmolested.
Hence, magi only try to hide themselves to escape the Association.
...So perhaps, I just don't know it and a magus lives in this town.

I hear Fuyuki City is a spiritually excellent area.
Such an area always has a distinguished magus with a history.
They are called the "Second Owner", an elite, and the Association entrusts the area to them.
Magi who would live in the area must visit them and obtain their permission to construct a workshop.

...Looking at it like that, we're thieves living here without the permission of the landlord.
Father was an outlaw who cut his ties with the Association and moved here without the consent of the administrator of Fuyuki.

The Owner doesn't know that Emiya Kiritsugu was a magus, and Kiritsugu didn't know who the Owner was.
With reasoning like that, I think our position is ambiguous.

Father, the real magus, has passed away.
And I, his son and pupil, don't know the Magic Association and have not the skill to be a magus.
...From the Association's point of view, they would want to catch an amateur like me doing things, but I've seen no movement yet.
No, I've heard that Japan is relatively hidden from the eyes of the Association, so I think I've just not been found out.

But that doesn't mean I can let my guard down.
People say that the eyes of the Association are everywhere. On top of that, if you commit a crime with magic, the heretic hunters of the church will come after you.
...That just means that whatever you use magic for, lack of care will create enemies.
I, Emiya Shirou, just have to study independently, taking that into account

"...Hm."
I wake up to see the sun shining in through the window.
The sun may have just risen as it's still a bit dark outside.
"...Hm. I'm really not good in the mornings."
I get up, trying not to be defeated by the morning chill, and quickly fold up my futon.

It's five thirty.
One of my strengths is waking up at this time, no matter how late I go to sleep. I do sometimes make mistakes and wake up late like yesterday, but I usually wake up early.
I think alarm clocks are degenerate, so I haven't used one since I was a kid.

"Alright, breakfast..."
Since I let Sakura do all the work yesterday, I have to return the favor this morning.
I should finish preparing before Sakura arrives.

I cook rice and make some miso soup.
It was radish and carrot yesterday, so I make onion and potato miso soup today.
I also make the usual broth egg and broth boil, and I'm done.
I cut and salt the saury, and stop just before cooking it.

"All right, that should do."
It's almost six o'clock.
I finished earlier than expected, so I have some extra time.
So, what should I do?
Unlike Shinto, there's no one in Miyama City.
After eight o'clock, there are no people around, and the town is terribly quiet.

At the junction is the house I saw this morning.
There's no sign of people, and the door has a "do not enter" sign.

...After only one day, the house is as quiet as an abandoned building.
Parents and older sister killed by the burglar.
What kind of life remains for the child left behind?


I bite my lip, feeling powerless.
Even after swearing to become like Kiritsugu, I can't do anything about something that happened so close by.
Even though I want to help someone, in the end, I don't even know what I can do.

I climb the hill and reach the Emiya house.
The lights are still on, so Sakura or Fuji-Nee must still be there.

"I'm home... Oh, just you, Fuji-Nee?"
"Hm? Oh, welcome home, Shirou."
Fuji-Nee turns around, munching on a rice cracker.
The TV shows a loud variety show.

"Geez, coming home at a time like this again... I told you to come home early since it gets dark early in the winter."
"I am home early. I'm taking part-time jobs that finish at eight, so don't be so unreasonable.
...So, where's Sakura? It looks like dinner's ready, but..."

"Sakura-chan went home early. She said she had something to do today, so she just cooked dinner and left."
Fuji-Nee says so happily.
As far as she's concerned, anyone who cooks for her is a good person.

"I see. That might be a good idea for a while. It's been dangerous recently, so maybe I should just cook dinner myself until next term."
"What? I protest! You come home so late, Shirou. If you don't cook until after that, we won't eat until after ten."

"...Hold on. Can't you just eat at home?"
"What? I am at home."
Fuji-Nee seems puzzled.
Honestly, I'm not sure if that makes me happy or sad.

"...Alright, I understand. I can't exactly expect you to cook for yourself, can I?
...Anyways, what's that thing by your feet? Don't tell me you've been picking up junk again."

Fuji-Nee has a terrible habit of leaving junk at my place.
Large bowls from restaurants, a heavy teapot she got in the shopping district, a strange guitar that plays by itself... I think she thinks of this place as some kind of a warehouse.

"Let me see. I'll throw it away if it's junk."
"This? Uh, it's a poster that was left over at my place...."
Fuji-Nee hands me the poster.
It's probably some infamous idol or something.

"Let's see..."
Here we have, a military-style guy with his thumbs up, on a cheap looking blue sky background.
In letters like blood, it reads:
   "Love's Lovely Ranger Land.
    Please join the Self-Defense Force"[r]
...Hold on, this is an army recruiting poster...!

"I don't want it, so you can have it."
"Whoa, I don't want this either!"
I roll up the poster and hit Fuji-Nee with it.

"Heheh, missed."
But.
Fuji-Nee deflects my attack with a poster she had hidden, and counterattacks mercilessly.
Bam.
The poster lightly knocks my

"Guhhh!?"
Stars! I saw stars!

"Heheh, don't imagine you can hit me with your skills. You need to practice more."
"Guh... t-that's not the problem. What was that? Why does a poster make a crash like that...?"
Could this be the skill of a master...!?

"Huh? Oh, sorry, this poster is the special first edition made from steel plate.
...Shirou, is your head all right...?"
"...Fuji-Nee, your personality is going to kill someone one day..."

"Hehe. I'm not worried. Shirou would marry me if that happened."
"Huh, I completely refuse. I have no intention of marrying such a thoughtless killer."

"Hey... I don't think I'm that dangerous of a person."
"I knew it. So it's true that people never know themselves."
How true, how true.
I'll have to watch out or I'll be killed.

"Huh, just keep saying that. Anyways, I'm hungry, Shirou. I've waited all this time, so let's have dinner."
Fuji-Nee stands up.
...How strange. Fuji-Nee is helping out (even if it's only setting up the dishes). She must be really hungry.

"Okay. Then you can get the dishes out. You can pour rice, right?"
"I can. Hey, Shirou, can I use a bowl?"
"I guess so. Sakura isn't here today, so there'll be some left over anyway."
"All right. I'll use the same for you, then."
Fuji-Nee pours rice into two bowls.

"......"
Oh well. I was going to have seconds anyway. And besides, if I argue with Fuji-Nee, she'll take my dinner away.
And to add...
Chaotic dinners like this have been common scenes for many years now.

...The day ends.
Finishing a rowdy dinner and seeing Fuji-Nee off, I take a bath.
After that, I practice my daily routine in the shed.
I complete it as usual and go to sleep.
It is one in the morning.
The day ends peacefully without any troubles.
"Yeah. I have time, so I'll make something else."
I open the refrigerator.
All that's left are some cucumber and potatoes.

"...Hmmm. I could cut and salt the cucumber, or cut the potatoes and serve them vinegared...."
But those are both things I could do in a couple of minutes, and they're better fresh.
It'll be half an hour until Fuji-Nee and Sakura arrive, so I should make a dish right before they get here.

"...Hmph."
In that case, this is free time I can't make much use of.
Is there anything I can do in thirty minutes...?
"There's some chicken, so..."
I could cook some bite-sized meat rolls with vegetables, or something like that.

I cut the meat and tenderize it.
At a glance, the meat tenderizer is really evil. It's like a hammer, but it's flat on four sides and has lots of spikes coming out of it.

If it were bigger, it would make a great instrument of torture.
I flatten the meat with the scary object, put some carrots and kidney beans on it, roll it up, cook it in the pan, and steam it with wine.

"...Huh!? Hold on, what am I doing...!?"
At that point, I regain my sanity.
I was trying to make a side dish, as the saury was already the main dish.
So what am I doing, making another main dish...!?

"...Honestly. I must have let my guard down, cooking just to pass the time."
"Eh? You were cooking just to pass the time, Senpai?"
"Yeah. The thing is, I was trying to make a side dish. But before I realized it, I was using the knife. Well, I guess habit is a scary thing... of course, that's just an excuse."

"But isn't that alright? It's a bit big for breakfast, but since you made it, I don't think there'll be any leftovers."
"You think so? No, that's not the problem.
There's no need for two suns in the sky. I'll have to ask one of them to leave."
"What!? You're not going to eat it, Senpai?"

"I will. I wasn't planning to, but I'll pack lunch today. That way, it won't be a waste."
"Wow... Senpai, you're going to make lunch right now?"
"It'll be close, but I think I can at least get my"

And then.
I finally realize someone's behind me.

"Good morning, Senpai. I'm here again today."
Sakura greets me with a smile.
It's not unusual for Sakura to come into the kitchen at this time.
She always rings the bell as she comes in, but sometimes I don't notice, like this morning.

"G-Good morning, Sakura. Breakfast's ready, so you can relax in the living room. There's some tea there."
I answer her, staring at the frying pan.
On the table is a pot of hot water, a teapot, and some snacks.

"Oh, yes. You're perfect again today, Senpai."
Sakura's voice is lively, as if she's happy about something.
...And Sakura comes into the kitchen instead of going to the table.

"Senpai? You're making lunch, right?"
"Hm? Yeah, it turned out that way. It's a good dish for lunch, so I thought I'd make some side dishes."
"Um, then can I help? I'll make my own, so..."
"Oh, wait. If you don't mind having the same thing, I can give you some of mine."
"Yes. I was watching and I wanted to have some of yours."
"All right. Can you cook the rice, then? We don't have enough for two. There should be a fast rice cooker over there."
"Yes, I'll take care of it. I'll go and start that, then."

I hear the sound of her footsteps, and of her tying her apron.
"Senpai? We're okay with two cups of rice, right?"
"Hmm, I think that'll be enough."
With quick movements, Sakura comes to help in the kitchen.

"Morning! Well done, it smells great!"
A little past six-thirty.
Thirty minutes after Sakura, Fuji-Nee arrives as usual.

"Good morning, Sensei. Please wait a little longer for breakfast."
"Yep, I'll wait. ...Oh, Sakura-chan, are you making breakfast with Shirou?"
"No, Senpai made breakfast on his own. We're making lunch right now."

Sakura's voice is really lively.
We're not doing anything particularly fun, so I don't know what she's so happy about.

"I see, so of course you're in a good mood. Cooking and Shirou, so much fun stuff. Okay, we don't have much time, but take it easy."
Laughing, Fuji-Nee sits at the table and pours some tea.

"...Geez, she must still be off dreaming. What's so fun about cooking for school?"
I put the pan back onto the rack.
The food's made, so all that's left is to pack the lunchboxes.

"Sorry, Sakura. I made you do extra work before club activities.
I wanted you to relax since you did a lot yesterday."
"Huh? Don't worry about that at all. Like Fujimura-Sensei said, I find cooking fun."

She smiles.
Well, I know she likes cooking... but still, it must be hard for her getting up at five o'clock to make lunch.
Besides, Sakura comes and makes dinner often.
So if I'm getting her to cook in the mornings too, she might have no free time at all.

"...Phew. I'm grateful for the help, but you should relax, Sakura. You should sleep in during the mornings, and after school is for playing around. You don't have to come and help around my house."

"Well, I am relaxing. You made breakfast today, and I got some food from you for lunch too."

She smiles.
...Sigh.
It's been a year and a half since Sakura started to help out. Now, she keeps coming back like this no matter what I say.

"That's different. You have your own life too, so you can't just take care of me and Fuji-Nee. If you're taking care of us, you won't be able to do all the things you want to."

"Ahaha, that's fine. My only hobbies are archery and cooking. In fact, my goal is to beat you at cooking, and I think I'm almost there."
Sakura puffs her chest out boastfully.
...Gah.
I want to argue back, but it's true as she is about to beat me.

"So please don't worry about it. I like cooking here, and improving is fun.
I'm helping you to pay you back for showing me this great pleasure, and for my own benefit."

"...Hm. Does that mean you're stealing some of my skill every day, Sakura?"
"Yes. I improve quickly just by helping you. So please be ready. I'll make you admit defeat someday."
Whoa.
I can't believe she said it so bluntly!

"...Man. If I'd known this was coming, I would never have taught you to cook. You never even heard of oil before coming here, but now you're after me like an enemy. Really, why are you chasing me like this?
Can't you just be happy making food?"

"Of course I'm after you. You can't be better than me."
"...?"
I'm not sure what's so bad about that, but we should start setting the table for breakfast.

"Alrighty."
I check the saury.
Placing my chopstick on the well grilled stomach, I check how cooked it is.

"I guess that's done. Here, Sakura, can you take this to the table?"
"Yes, thank you Senpai."

I hand the plate of saury to Sakura.
Then, as if remembering something important, Sakura stops dead.

"Sakura? What's wrong, did you leave something at home?"
Sakura may seem shrewd, but she actually forgets things a lot.
It's not unusual for her to remember something and stop like this.
But... it seems like that's not the case this morning.

"...Sakura?"
"......"
There's no answer.
She just blankly stares at my hand like she's still in a daze, then...

"Senpai... what's that bruise on your hand?"
She asks me a strange question.

"Huh?"
I look down at the hand she's talking about.

"Huh...? You're right, there is a bruise. That's weird, I don't remember hitting it anywhere."

For some reason, there's a big bruise on the back of my left hand.
It's quite an impressive welt, and it looks like it came from some sort of a cut.
Even on my own hand, it looks bad.
Perhaps Sakura's not feeling well as she's very quiet.

"Sorry, can you handle the rest? I'll go put something on it."
I let Sakura take care of the kitchen and head for the dojo.
I don't know if I did this during my sleep, but I'll have to treat it.


But for some reason, I'm worried about Sakura, who looked awkward and downcast.

"I'll go on ahead, then."
"Sakura, are you sure you're all right? You can skip your club if you're not feeling well."

"No, I'm fine. It's just a light headache, so you shouldn't worry about it. I only look bad because you imagine it. I'm doing really well today."
She says so with a smile.
...But anyone can tell she's just bluffing.

"Really well, huh? Even though you couldn't eat any breakfast?"
"Oh...."
She looks away awkwardly.

Without looking up, she replies...
"...Please excuse me. You're the one who should be resting, Senpai."
With those words, she leaves.

The table is cleared.
But on the plate in the kitchen, Sakura's meal remains untouched.

"Honestly, what's wrong with her?"
She had been in such a good mood, but after seeing my bruise, Sakura suddenly became quiet and started to make lots of mistakes.

She overfilled the tea, drenched the omelets with soy sauce, and sat down at the table with her apron on.
And on top of that, she ate nothing and went to school looking pale.

"Maybe she caught a cold or something."
I mutter to myself while cleaning up.
It's the first time I've seen Sakura like this.
I got to know her during the summer four years ago, and she started coming here to help a year and a half ago.
In that time, I've never seen her look this ill.


...Fuji-Nee will be at the archery range, so I don't think there'll be a problem there. But I should go and check on her after school or sometime...
Twenty minutes after taking the bus from my school, I arrive at the neighboring town of Shinto across the bridge.

"...Oh, it's not five o'clock yet? I guess I still have some time."
Miyama City is a residential district, so it's hard to find part-time jobs there, but the developing Shinto has many available.
The school rules allow for part-time jobs, so I work a few easy ones.

Within them, I prefer hard physical labor that ends as quickly as possible.
It's killing two birds with one stone, as it builds my body while I get paid for it.

Today's job is a simple loading job from five to eight o'clock.
Even though it's only three hours, there's six hours worth of work to do. They make you run around without a minute's rest.

So I should rest when I can, even if it's just for ten minutes.
It's a waste of energy walking around until my job, so I guess I'll rest in the park.

This park among the buildings is like a big field.
A park should be filled with people like families and lovers on weekends, but it's empty here now.
No... this place is always desolate.

"This place is the same as always."
I'm a bit sad.
The utterly neglected ground looks awful compared to the neatly organized surroundings.
The desolate area makes the wind feel cold.
This is the remains of the conflagration ten years ago, and this is the place where I was saved from burning to death.

"I wonder why they don't plant grass here. It's a waste to keep it like this."
It's a large area, so if they retiled it, the park would get bigger.
Thinking absent-mindedly, I sit down on a bench.


I stare at the burned land to pass the time.
I don't remember what happened here back then.
I probably don't remember because I was a kid, and it wouldn't have been an easy scene to memorize.
All I can remember is that it was hot and I couldn't breathe.
And that people died trying to save others.

"I wonder why...."
For example, an adult that tried to save a child from a burning house. He saved the child, but died in its place.
For example, there were people who had their throats burned, but they gave what little water they had to one guy, and the others died.
For example, there was someone who ran alone to get away from the fire as fast as possible, and everyone that he passed on the way died.

And for example...
People who died because they gave away something that was saving them, only to save others they didn't even know.

"......"
I didn't like things like that.
It makes me mad that those who tried hard were sacrificed.
Am I greedy to want an ending where everybody is safe and happy?
All I wanted was to see people relax peacefully, so why couldn't I manage such a simple thing?

'That's difficult. What you want is to save everyone.'

Kiritsugu answered so to the question I asked as a child.
Of course, as a child, I denied it.
Because Kiritsugu saved me. I knew he was a sorcerer who could do anything.
I knew he was a superhero who couldn't ignore people in need, who saved them for no benefit.
So I believed Kiritsugu could have saved everyone back then.

When I told him that, he made a troubled expression and said something that I remember to this day.

'Shirou, saving one person means not saving others. Look, a superhero can only save the people he has saved. It's obvious, but that is the definition of a superhero.'

I understand that.
It's obvious, now that he's said it.
Let's say there's a robber and some hostages, and the robber intends to kill the hostages.
With normal methods, most of the hostages will be killed.

Even if you use a miraculous method to save all the hostages, there will still be one person who isn't saved.
That, of course, is the robber whose hostages were rescued.
The people a superhero saves are only those he decides to save.
That's why even God cannot save everyone.

"All the more so if it's a natural disaster. No one could have saved everybody."
The fire ten years ago was like that.
It's not something I, who was miraculously saved from it, can talk about now.

"But I don't want that."
I don't want such a thing.
I don't want help that has a limited capacity.
You have to help, no matter how impossible it is.
I can't stand to have strangers dying around me like back then.

So if I had been there ten years ago, even if it was impossible, I would have gone into the fire and...
"I would certainly have died in vain."
That's for certain.
Geez, I'm hopeless.

"Gah, it's five o'clock already."
The five o'clock bell rings.
I stand up and quickly make my way to my work.

When my job's done, the sun has already set.
It's a bit before eight.
I finished ten minutes early because I worked too hard.
It seems I worked frantically since I went to that place before work.

Here in front of the station, the night's just getting started.
There are lots of people, and a constant flow of cars on the road.
The buildings are still lit up, and just looking at them makes me feel like I'm watching a grand festival of illumination.

"I guess I don't have to buy anything for Fuji-Nee."
I walk while looking up at the lighted building.
It's the biggest building in Shinto, so I can't see the top clearly.
I just gaze up the building, just enjoying the night's scenery...
"...?"
...When I think I see something out of place.

"What was that?"
I stop and stare at the rooftop.
I focus my eyes, looking at the thing as small as a grain of rice.

"...What the..."
It looks like someone I know.

Why is she there?
What would she be doing there?
With her long hair fluttering and doing nothing, she looks down at the town.

"......"
It doesn't seem like she notices me down here.
No, there's no way she could see me.
She's so high up that I, with better eyesight than most, can barely see her by improving my vision with magical energy.
I can recognize her since she's standing there alone, but there's no way she would notice me down here among all these people.

She's just looking down at the town.
Maybe she's looking for something, as I can feel her sharp stare even down here.
"......"
I forget about time and keep looking up at the girl standing in the sky.
She is on top of a tall tower.
She's like a witch, looking down at the earth with the moon behind her.

"Oh..."
And then.
She must be done with whatever she was doing, as she disappears.
Her figure has disappeared and the scene returns to the beautiful view of the night.
"That was Tohsaka, right?"

I have no proof, but I think I'm right.
There aren't many girls with looks that stand out that much, and more than that, I'm not stupid enough to mistake a girl I secretly admire.

"...I see. But still..."
Well, it's...
Tohsaka sure has strange hobbies.
"Yeah, I guess I can train a bit if I have this much time."
The morning exercises are my daily routine, so I'll go and move my body a bit.

The Emiya household has a splendid dojo.
It was built for pleasure when the house was built, so there's no particular purpose to it.

"Well, Fuji-Nee is using it for herself, though."
I hear that this place was Fuji-Nee's playground even before I came here.
But I became Kiritsugu's student and started using this place a lot, so Fuji-Nee hated me back then.

"...Well."
There's only one thing to do now that I'm here.
Even a magus cannot neglect to train their body.
One of the requirements for a magus is to have excellent physical abilities.

While Kiritsugu was alive, we had many matches here.
Well, it was pretty much him beating on me, so I didn't learn anything about how to win in a fight.
...But I think I learned the difference between a fight and a battle.
In other words, I was taught the difference between killing your opponent and beating your opponent.

Knowledge and experience are different.
Unless I know in advance, it's hard to tell whether I'm involved in a fight or a murder.

...It's a simple story.
As long as you learn magic, you might destroy yourself, and times will come when you have to fight.
For a magi, a fight means killing each other.
So I think what Kiritsugu wanted to teach me was to prepare my mind for the prospect of death.

But it's been a while since my teacher passed away.
On my own, all I can do are simple exercises.
Things like push-ups, sit-ups, and stretching. Not too different from the morning practices I did in the archery club.
The only difference is if I'm training lightly or heavily.
"Yeah, I guess I can train a bit if I have this much time."
The morning exercises are my daily routine, so I'll go and stretch my body a bit.

The empty dojo is quiet enough to brace myself.
In the morning, when the sun has just risen, the silence has a holy feel to it that fascinates those who come here.

"...Well."
There's only one thing to do now that I'm here.
Since Kiritsugu died, this place has become a gym to train my body.

Even a magus cannot neglect to train their body.
One of the requirements for a magus is to have excellent physical abilities.
While Kiritsugu was alive, we had many matches here.

Well, it was pretty much him beating on me, so I didn't learn anything about how to win in a fight.
...But I think I learned the difference between a fight and a battle.

So I think what Kiritsugu wanted to teach me was to prepare my mind for the prospect of death.

But it's been a while since my teacher passed away.
On my own, all I can do are simple exercises that anyone could do.

"Well then, let's do this properly."
After warming up by stretching, I start my exercises, keeping my attention inside my body.

I comprehend the flow of the Magic Circuit, the friction in my bones, the distortion in my thinking during fatigue, all while I'm training.

"120... 150... 170..."
Even a simple push-up can be training for the Magic Circuit if I put on mental shackles instead of metal weights.
As I don't have a teacher, exercise like that of club's morning practice is an important part of training.
It's almost seven thirty.
Sakura and Fuji-Nee have already left for their morning club practice.
I went to school early yesterday because Issei wanted me to, but I leave my house at the usual time today.

I run into an unusual scene when I reach the intersection.
Several police cars are parked outside a house.
Something must have happened, as it's noisy and lots of people are surrounding the area.

"Hm?"
I'm curious, but I cannot tell what's going on with all the people surrounding it.
I have no time, so I should prioritize school.

I reach school ten minutes before the bell.
I enter the main gate as usual.
"Hey, morning Emiya."
I bump into a familiar female student.

"What, you've not changed yet, Mitsuzuri? It's almost homeroom, you shouldn't have time to say hello to me."

"Ahahaha! You're right. You're cold as always, Emiya!"
She laughs as if something is really funny.
Mitsuzuri Ayako.
She was my classmate in first year, and she's now the captain of the archery club.

She's very insightful, and everyone expected her to become captain since the first year.
...Well, in other words, her mental age is older than her real age, so she's been the older sister type everyone counts on since she was a first year.
Though, she gets mad when people say that. According to her, she's not that old.

"Huh? Were you just thinking badly of me?"
"I wouldn't dream of it. I was just thinking objectively about the truth. Though, it's up to you if you want to feel angry about it."

"Oh, you don't say. That's good. You answered honestly, but you never revealed what you were thinking about.
You don't let your guard down like Shinji does."
"Shinji? What does he have to do with this?"

"Because you guys are friends.
You're the only male friend he has, right? And you might have forgotten, but I'm the captain of the archery club. Don't you think it's only natural for me to connect the current problem student and the problem student that quit?"

"Yeah, that's certainly natural. The archery club has nothing to do with it, but I certainly do have an unsavory and inseparable relationship with him."

"Oh, that makes me mad. You get so cold when talking about the archery club.
You've got it nice. You left Shinji behind and just quit. Couldn't you think about those who were left, like me and Sakura?"

"Hmm. Did Shinji do something again?"
"A day doesn't pass when he doesn't do something.
...But still, yesterday was a bit too much.[l]
He even made a guy from the first year quit."

Mitsuzuri sighs seriously.
It's rare for her to make a face like this, but even more than that, I can't ignore what she just said.

"What's that? A student quit? Why?"
"Shinji took his anger out on him. He got loads of female students around and made the kid, who has barely started handling bows, shoot. He laughed at him until he hit the target."
"Huh!? And you let that happen!?"

"Of course I didn't! But a captain's busy, you know? I can't always be in the dojo. You know that."

"...That's true, but what the hell was Shinji thinking? He does teach very harshly, but he's not the type to make fun of people like that."

"...I'm surprised. You really are like that."
"Hm, what do you mean by that? Were you just thinking badly of me?"

"Oh, I was just thinking objectively about the truth. So it's up to you if you want to feel angry about it."
"...Stop copying me.[l]
Fine, but what about Shinji? Why did he act like that?"

"Hmm, from what I heard, it was something like getting turned down harshly by Tohsaka."
"Huh? You mean, that Tohsaka?"

"There's no other Tohsaka at our school.[l]
I'm talking about the honor student in class 2-A, Miss Perfect, Tohsaka Rin."
"...I don't think I've heard that nickname before."

It's the first time I've heard the nickname, but I would probably agree with it.
With Tohsaka involved, I can understand even Shinji getting turned down, and most of all...
If it was Tohsaka, I can see her refusing him mercilessly.

"Anyways, Shinji's been like this since yesterday.
That's why I've had to keep an eye on the dojo until now today."
"Shinji has a nasty temper. I know it's hard, but keep up the hard work, Mitsuzuri."

"Okay, okay. But Shinji never knows when to stop, you know? I feel like he'll do something really bad if he asks her out again and gets turned down again."
"No, even Shinji wouldn't approach someone who turned him down. He's pretty good about that kind of thing."

"But he can't help it if the person who turned him down comes near him. I don't know why, but Tohsaka comes and visits the dojo pretty often. You quit, so you wouldn't know."

"Hm?"
That's the first I've heard of it.
Tohsaka Rin doesn't do any club activities for personal reasons. I thought she went straight home since she even turned down the recommendation to join the student council.

"Well, maybe that sort of thing is good every now and then. He has a haughty attitude, so it might be good for him to have a hard time for once."
Mitsuzuri says some dangerous things.
...Come to think of it, I heard that Tohsaka has many enemies. Could Mitsuzuri be one of them?

"Hey Mitsuzuri, that's going too..."
"Oh, it's almost time. Bye Emiya, come and see my archery skills sometime."
Mitsuzuri hurries off.

"She's just like always."
But I like that part of her.
Feeling calmer now, I head for the classroom.

It's lunchtime.
Our school has a splendid cafeteria and most students eat there.
But there are some old-fashioned students who bring their own lunches. Two of them happen to be me and the student council president in front of me.

"Emiya, could you give me some of that fried chicken? My lunch is desperately lacking in meat."
"Sure, but why is your lunch so plain? You live in a temple, but there aren't any teachings prohibiting meat or alcohol, right?

"Such an anachronism. It's just my father's way.
He says there's no luxurious foods for a young priest, and that I should have to work for what I want. I'm thinking of running away and joining the circus."
"Oh, yeah, that sounds like that guy."

Issei's father is the priest of the Ryudou Temple, and a bold guy who's old friends with the old man at Fuji-Nee's place.
You can't expect a normal personality when he's friends with a guy like that.

"That's great. Well then, I'll give you one in the hope of repayment someday."
I hand him my lunchbox.
"Thank you. This too is part of my religious training."
Issei bows deeply.
...How can I put this? I never know what to say when things like this remind me that he's the son of a priest.

"Oh, by the way, Emiya. Did you know there was something going on around the 2nd avenue? It's right around the intersection where we part."
"Intersection...?"
The intersection this morning... he must mean that clamor with all the police cars.

"I heard there was a murder. I don't know the details, but of the family of four, only the child survived. They say the older sister and the parents were stabbed to death. But what's strange is that they think the weapon was a long one, not like a knife or something."


A long weapon? He must mean something like a sword.
It was a murder... so that must mean the sister and the parents were killed.

...I picture it.
Someone barging in during the night. Unjust violence. A one-sided pillage like an accident. Slashed parents. The sister killed without even knowing what's going on. To the side, the child covered in their blood.

"Issei, have they caught the murderer?"
"It doesn't seem like it. Accidents from faulty construction in Shinto, and murder here. It's no wonder they're making the curfew here at school earwhat's wrong, Emiya? Did you choke on something?"

"Hm? Nothing, what's wrong?"
"No... I was just surprised since you had a nasty expression. Sorry, this wasn't something I should have talked about during lunch.

Issei tries to soften the air apologetically.
...I was fine with the topic, but was I really making such a nasty face?

And then, there's a quiet knock at the door.
"Excuse me, is Ryudou here?"
"Huh? Oh, what is it, Sensei?"
Issei addresses Kuzuki, who just entered.
It must be a simple talk about the student council as Issei seems pretty relaxed.

"...Wow."
That's not something you see everyday.
Despite his appearance, Issei's very shy. The guy who draws a line against his classmates and even his teachers is letting his guard down with Kuzuki.

"Maybe they get along because they're both so serious."
Kuzuki Souichirou, the teacher in charge of class 2-A, is serious and stubborn.
Probably that aspect helps him get along with Issei, who prizes order and discipline.


The two continue to talk.
All the while, I can't get the story of the murder out of my head.
I'm worried about the conversation I had this morning, so I've made my way to the archery club before I knew it.
"Geez, what am I doing?"
According to Mitsuzuri, Tohsaka Rin comes here often.
Well, I really don't care about that, but I know that Shinji getting angry at her is going to be a problem.

"...Shinji just doesn't stop when he gets angry...."
It's bad if Shinji gets violent just because she turned him down.
...I don't know why it's bad, it's just bad.
It makes me feel bad just thinking about it, so I have to stop it from happening.

"Oh, Tohsaka's not here."
Tohsaka isn't around. Mitsuzuri's worries were needless.

"Oh, who's not here?"
"...!!"
I spin around.

"So... who's not here?"
And there's Issei, whom I just left behind.

"Oh, i-it's you, Issei. Don't scare me like that."
"Well, you were looking at the dojo suspiciously.
So, who's not there?"
"Tohsaka. I heard that she had an argument with Shinji yesterday, so I came to see how things were."

"Oh wow, that is suspicious. You gave your reasons without being asked. I only asked you who wasn't here."

"...! W-What? What I do shouldn't concern you."

"Yes, that's right. But it's useless, Emiya. Tohsaka won't be here. That's because she intentionally skipped school today."
"What?"
Skipped school... so, she was absent today?

"I see, she's absent... wait, Issei. How can you say she skipped school? I don't think she'd do such a thing."
"Of course she will. She won't catch a cold. As I see it, she's evil. You'll be eaten if you let her looks deceive you, Emiya."

"Hm."
Somehow, Issei's words annoy me.
It's true that I don't know her, but I can't imagine that she's a bad person.

"You're going too far, Issei. Tohsaka can't be like that."

"Hmm? What, you're after Tohsaka too? Oh, I'm sorry. Please ignore what I just said."
"...!"
A-After Tohsaka!? Who said anything like that!?

"D-Don't jump to conclusions! I just thought it'd be bad if Shinji got into trouble again."

"So you were planning to stop Shinji if he attacked Tohsaka, huh? You're playing an unrewarded role again. ...I don't really care, but you have a bad taste, Emiya."

"It's not unrewarded since I haven't done it. But Issei, didn't you say something strange?"
"Huh? You mean that going after Tohsaka is in bad taste?"

"Yeah. Tohsaka is really popular. I haven't heard any bad rumors about her."
"Yes, none. And that's exactly what I don't like about it."
Issei looks away, snorting.

"What don't you like about it?"
"Everything. The woman is a fox, a schoolgirl, a monster. I just don't like her physiologically. I won't say anything bad, but you should try to hate her too."

"Issei, don't you always say we shouldn't talk badly of people behind their backs?"
"Idiot, this doesn't count as talking behind their back. I'm speaking so that she can hear it."

Ah, no wonder I feel someone's eyes from the archery dojo.
...Thank God.
I'm so glad Tohsaka is absent today.

"Please, Issei. Please restrict yourself to talking behind people's backs."
"All right, if you say so.
But I wasn't insulting her at all. I was only saying that I'm on guard against her. That should be within my rights."

"But you were saying things like monster and fox..."
...And I think the term schoolgirl is discrimination.

"No, that was just praise. There are good foxes and monsters too.
I only applied the terms to describe Tohsaka."
"Katsu."
Issei laughs.

"Well, I'll be going. I'm going back to the student council room, but you're going to work, right? You shouldn't have time to play around like this."

He must feel refreshed now that he's said everything he wanted, as he leaves calmly.
I've known him for 2 years now, but I still don't understand his personality.

Twenty minutes after taking the bus from my school, I arrive at the neighboring town of Shinto across the bridge.

"...Oh, it's not five o'clock yet? I guess I still have some time."
Miyama City is a residential district, so it's hard to find part-time jobs there, but the developing Shinto has many available.
The school rules allow for part-time jobs, so I work a few easy ones.

Within them, I prefer hard physical labor that ends as quickly as possible.
It's killing two birds with one stone, as it builds my body while I get paid for it.

Today's job is a simple loading job from five to eight o'clock.
Even though it's only three hours, there's six hours worth of work to do. They make you run around without a minute's rest.

So I should rest when I can, even if it's just for ten minutes.
It's a waste of energy walking around until my job, so I guess I'll rest in the park.

This park among the buildings is like a big field.
A park should be filled with people like families and lovers on weekends, but it's empty here now.
No... this place is always desolate.

"This place is the same as always."
I'm a bit sad.
The utterly neglected ground looks awful compared to the neatly organized surroundings.
The desolate area makes the wind feel cold.
This is the remains of the conflagration ten years ago, and this is the place where I was saved from burning to death.

"I wonder why they don't plant grass here. It's a waste to keep it like this."
It's a large area, so if they retiled it, the park would get bigger.
Thinking absent-mindedly, I sit down on a bench.


I stare at the burned land to pass the time.
I don't remember what happened here back then.
I probably don't remember because I was a kid, and it wouldn't have been an easy scene to memorize.
All I can remember is that it was hot and I couldn't breathe.
And that people died trying to save others.

"I wonder why...."
For example, an adult that tried to save a child from a burning house. He saved the child, but died in its place.
For example, there were people who had their throats burned, but they gave what little water they had to one guy, and the others died.
For example, there was someone who ran alone to get away from the fire as fast as possible, and everyone that he passed on the way died.

And for example...
People who died because they gave away something that was saving them, only to save others they didn't even know.

"......"
I didn't like things like that.
It makes me mad that those who tried hard were sacrificed.
Am I greedy to want an ending where everybody is safe and happy?
All I wanted was to see people relax peacefully, so why couldn't I manage such a simple thing?

'That's difficult. What you want is to save everyone.'

Kiritsugu answered so to the question I asked as a child.
Of course, as a child, I denied it.
Because Kiritsugu saved me. I knew he was a sorcerer who could do anything.
I knew he was a superhero who couldn't ignore people in need, who saved them for no benefit.
So, I believed Kiritsugu could have saved everyone back then.

When I told him that, he made a troubled expression and said something that I remember to this day.

'Shirou, saving one person means not saving another. Look, a superhero can only save the people he has saved. It's obvious, but that is the definition of a superhero.'

I understand that.
It's obvious, now that he's said it.
Let's say there's a robber and some hostages, and the robber intends to kill the hostages.
With normal methods, most of the hostages will be killed.

Even if you use a miraculous method to save all the hostages, there will still be one person who isn't saved.
That, of course, is the robber whose hostages were rescued.
The people a superhero saves are only those he decides to save.
That's why even God cannot save everyone.

"All the more so if it's a natural disaster. No one could have saved everyone."
The fire ten years ago was like that.
It's not something I, who was miraculously saved from it, can talk about now.

"But I don't want that."
I don't want such a thing.
I don't want help that has a limited capacity.
You have to help, no matter how impossible it is.
I can't stand to have strangers dying around me like back then.

So, if I had been there ten years ago, even if it was impossible, I would have gone into the fire and...
"I would certainly have died in vain."
That's for certain.
Geez, I'm hopeless.

"Gah, it's already five o'clock."
The five o'clock bell rings.
I stand up and quickly make my way to my work.

When my job's done, the sun has already set.
It's a bit before eight.
I finished ten minutes early because I worked too hard.
It seems I worked frantically since I went to that place before work.

Here in front of the station, the night's just getting started.
There are lots of people, and a constant flow of cars on the road.
The buildings are still lit up, and just looking at them makes me feel like I'm watching a grand festival of illumination.

"I guess I don't have to buy anything for Fuji-Nee."
I walk while looking up at the lighted building.
It's the biggest building in Shinto, so I can't see the top clearly.
I just gaze up the building, just enjoying the night's scenery...
"...?"
...When I think I see something out of place.

"What was that?"
I stop and stare at the rooftop.
I focus my eyes, looking at the thing as small as a grain of rice.

"...What the..."
It looks like someone I know.

Why is she there?
What would she be doing there?
With her long hair fluttering and doing nothing, she looks down at the town.

"......"
It doesn't seem like she notices me down here.
No, there's no way she could see me.
She's so high up that I, with better eyesight than most, can barely see her by improving my vision with magical energy.
I can recognize her since she's standing there alone, but there's no way she would notice me down here among all these people.

She's just looking down at the town.
Maybe she's looking for something, as I can feel her sharp stare even down here.
"......"
I forget about time and keep looking up at the girl standing in the sky.
She is on top of a tall tower.
She's like a witch, looking down at the earth with the moon behind her.

"Oh..."
And then.
She must be done with whatever she was doing, as she disappears.
Her figure has disappeared and the scene returns to the beautiful view of the night.
"That was Tohsaka, right?"

I have no proof, but I think I'm right.
There aren't many girls with looks that stand out that much, and more than that, I'm not stupid enough to mistake a girl I secretly admire.

"...I see. But still..."
Well, it's...
Tohsaka sure has strange hobbies.
Classes end and it's time to go home.
I can't go anywhere as I have work today.
I should leave school and go straight to the neighboring town, but...

1) I'm worried about Tohsaka
2) I'm worried about Sakura.
...I'm worried about Sakura.
I know it won't do any good to worry about her, but I should at least see if she's okay....

I walk through the fourth floor, where the first year students are located.
There's no one in the hallway and not many left in the classrooms either.
It seems they've already gone home or to their clubs.

"...Dammit, Sakura will be at her club too."
Well, I've come this far.
I'll go to her classroom, and when I've checked she's not there, I can head to work.

"Let's see..."
I look into classroom 1-B.
The red tinted classroom is quiet and there's no sign of life.

There's no one in the classroom.
All the students have gone to their respective destinations.

In that red classroom, a lone shadow remains.

"Sakura."
I enter the red world and call out to her.

"...Senpai?"
The face, covered by her long hair, looks even more lifeless than this morning.

"What is it? Do you have some business here?"
"No, I have nothing to do here. I was just worried about you. You seemed a bit sick this morning."

"......"
Sakura makes a gloomy face.
She's clearly not doing well.

"Sakura, if you don't feel well, you should go home. I can walk you to the intersection, so let's go together."

"...No, I'm fine. I don't feel bad.
I'm going to go to the club as usual and have dinner at your place after that.
I'm okay, so please don't worry."
She picks up her bag and starts to walk like she's running away.

"Idiot, what are you saying with a face like that? Come on, skip your club. After all, there's no point in doing archery in that state."
I grab Sakura's hand as she tries to pass me.

"...Oh."
A crash.
Sakura almost falls over just from being grabbed.
"Hey...!"
I quickly pull her hand back.
The body I'm dragging is surprisingly light.

"Y-You surprised me... Sakura, are you really all right?
You're not standing steadily at all."
"......"
Sakura looks away apologetically.
Geez, what's wrong with her today?

"Anyways, you're skipping the club today. I'll skip my work too, so let's go home."
"......"
Sakura is silent and does not answer.
She doesn't shake my hand off, but it also seems she won't go home obediently.

"What's going on, Sakura? You know it's pointless to go to the club like that."
"...You're right. But Nii-san wants me to, so I have to go,"
Sakura mutters.


...!
If she says so with a face like that, I can't respond.
It seems the circumstances at Sakura's house are complicated and they're not something I can meddle with.

...No matter how much I think she is part of my family, her real family is the Matous.
Whatever I say, they're just the words of an outsider.

"...You're only going to watch at the club?"
"Huh...? Oh yes. I know myself that I can't shoot right now."

"I see. So you're basically just preserving Shinji's authority."
I pull out a chair and sit on it.
I also pull another chair out from the desk next to it.

"Um... Senpai?"
"Just sit down. I won't try to stop you from going to the club, but rest for a while. You can tell Shinji I held you up and made you late."

"I-I can't say that...! If I do, Nii-san will, uh..."

"Shinji messes with me all the time.
It's nice that he has something to talk about every day.
And it's not a lie, so you shouldn't feel guilty saying it."
I urge Sakura to sit down.

"......"
Sakura sits down quietly.

"All right. Then, wait here for a while. I'm going to go and steal some tea from the student council room. You're forbidden from standing up until I come back."

"...Huh? But you might get into trouble..."

"Only if a teacher finds me. Hey, I'm used to this. There's no problem unless I run into a teacher in the hallway, so you can wait here."
"I-I can't. I can't wait here while you're doing something dangerous. Senpai, I don't care about the tea."

"I'm saying it's not dangerous. Just sit down. Drinking tea in the classroom is a good thing to try once."
"Oh..."

I jump out into the hallway.
The student council room isn't far away.
I'll get the tea set quickly and surprise Sakura.

...Time passes.
While we do something silly like drinking tea together in a classroom, we just stare outside.
Outside the window is a glowing sunset that hurts my eyes.

"......"
Sakura stares blankly at the sunset.
I have nothing to talk about, so I follow Sakura's example and keep my mouth shut.

Time passes slowly since we're not talking.
Sakura isn't the talkative type, and she often just stares at the scenery.
I guess she's more relaxed by herself.
Come to think of it, Sakura wants to be alone a lot.
It's not like she's excluding herself from the crowd, but she wants to isolate herself within the crowd. She looks outside the crowd more than in it.

That must be why she stayed here in the classroom.
Sakura doesn't actively try to spend time with others.
Fuji-Nee and I are special.
Even I wouldn't have known her if I hadn't met Shinji.

"......"
I sneak a glance at Sakura.
When Shinji introduced me to her 4 years ago, she was just a small girl.
Now she's my junior who comes to help around the house, and her childish image is disappearing.

Sakura has grown beautiful.
...No, she was beautiful before, but I think she's become too beautiful as a member of the opposite sex.
On top of that, she's thoughtful and gentle.
With that many good qualities, I can understand her being called beautiful alongside Tohsaka Rin.

"......"
But it's strange, I don't understand it.
Sakura is alone often.
She doesn't seem to have any friends in the archery club, and seeing how she's alone in this classroom, she might not have any friends in her class either.

...Come to think of it, I only know Sakura from the archery club and from my place.
I don't know how she is at school or at home.

"......"
While I think about this, looking up at the red sky...
"Senpai, do you remember?"
Looking outside, Sakura asks me a question.

"...? Remember what?"
"It was a long time ago, back before I met you..."
"Um, you mean before we knew each other...?"

"Yes. It was four years ago, right when I entered this school.
I wasn't used to the school, and I was walking about aimlessly when I saw something strange.

"...Yeah, I really wonder how it ended up like that.
Even though it was after school and the track team had left, someone was still running around alone. When I looked closer wondering what he was doing, I realized that he was doing high jumps by himself."

A smile.
It must be a lovely memory, as Sakura is smiling happily.

"It was a really red sunset. Everything was red and beautiful, but so lonely.
In it, he just continued to run alone. Running, jumping, dropping the pole, and repeating. There was no one around and he clearly couldn't jump over it, but he kept on trying.

"It wasn't something that could be done with effort. The pole was way over his head.
Even I could tell that it was impossible, so he must have known as well."

"...?"
I understand, but I wonder what she's talking about.
I don't think it's strange to see someone practicing even after school.

"I was a bad girl back then. Something bad had happened to me, and I just wanted to take it out on someone. I wanted to see this person fail, give up, and be discouraged, so I kept watching him.
But he wouldn't give up.
He repeated it over and over, even though it was impossible for him. Not complaining at all for all that time."

"...Wow. Maybe he was on the edge? Like the next day was the test, and he wouldn't get chosen unless he could jump that high?

"No, that wasn't it. He wasn't on the track team or anything."
Oh, I see.
...Well, that's fine... But why are you smiling, Sakura?

"And then, while I was watching him, I realized. He didn't care about what he was doing. He just happened to run into something he couldn't do, and he was obstinate about not losing.
The sun set, and he just cleaned up and went home. He must have been really tired, but he walked away calmly like nothing had happened."

"I don't get it. If he quit, that must mean he jumped over it, right? So how high was it?"

"Ahahaha, well, the thing is, he couldn't jump over it. He tried for 3 hours, but he was convinced at last that he couldn't jump over it."
"Man, that's some ending."

"He was so earnest that I even worried about him.
He's probably someone very dependable.
But that made me feel uneasy and lonely."
Her voice itself sounds so lonely, it seems like it will be swallowed by the red in this room.

"Okay, I understand the story... But what about it, Sakura?"
"No, it's okay if you don't understand. That just means that even though it looked that way to me, it was just an everyday thing for him."
Despite her gloomy mood earlier, Sakura smiles sweetly.

"......"
...And then, even though I'm pretty dull, I understand when she puts it like that.
I don't remember it myself, but four years ago was right after my father died.
Back then, I did lots of reckless things, so I guess I did something like that.

"...Uh, Sakura, so that was..."
"Yes, he is the senior before me now.
Back then, he was so small that I thought he was my age."
...Ugh.
I wish she wouldn't talk about my height back then.
Well, I'm not that tall even now, but I did grow, you know?

"That's it. I've known Senpai since then."
"I-I see. That's the first time I heard that."
I look away. She saw me during an embarrassing moment.

Then.
"Yes, we were both looking at the same thing."
With a gesture like a prayer, Sakura says something strange.

"Huh...?"
I ask, feeling worried.
But as if to drown it out, the familiar bell echoes through the school.

"Oh, the bell."
It's been thirty minutes since I stopped Sakura. The clock says four-thirty.
"I guess I held you up too long. I'll clean up, so you can go on ahead. You feel better, right?"

"Yes, I feel great thanks to you. Please look forward to dinner tonight."
Sakura gets up.
It doesn't seem like she's bluffing as she really seems well.

"Yeah... oh, sorry Sakura. I have to go to work now. I'll be late today, so you don't have to push yourself to come to my place."
"I understand. Then I'll just cook your dinner and leave."
Sakura bows and leaves.

"Oh well."
Fuji-Nee will be at my house, so she should be able to take Sakura home when she leaves.
I have to make a living too, so I should go to work quickly....
...My awakening is dark.
Perhaps I just don't dream much, but unless something really special happens, I always seem to have the same dream.

...What I imagine are swords.
I don't know why it is, but this is the only thing that comes into my mind.
There's no meaning or reason to it.
It may just be one of the aspects making up Emiya Shirou.

There are no dreams to dream.
The only things I recall from sleep are things I was taught a long time ago.
For example, about magi.
Even if I'm an amateur, if I'm a magus, it's only natural for me to understand the kind of world I live in.

To put it simply, a magus is an exception in conflict with modern society.
But even exceptions must band together to survive.
Father told me that the group of magi is called the "Magic Association".
...He also said that I shouldn't associate with them.

The group called the Magic Association hides magic and organizes magi.
They basically keep watch to see that magi do not affect society with magic, but the strange part is that they do not prohibit misuse of magic.

According to Kiritsugu, the Magic Association is only interested in the concealment of magic.
Even if a magus carries out his research at the expense of the lives of many ordinary people, the Magic Association will not punish him.
Their priority is that magic should not become public, so they do not ban magic.
So, they're crazy people who think you can do anything as long as you don't get caught.

Anyway, the surveillance of the Magic Association is thorough.
Most magical research would cost the lives of ordinary people, and as a result, the existence of magic would become public.
So, the Association does not allow research that would harm society.

So magi stay at home and research quietly, while the normal world carries on unmolested.
Hence, magi only try to hide themselves to escape the Association.
...So perhaps I just don't know it, and a magus lives in this town.

I hear Fuyuki City is a spiritually excellent area.
Such an area always has a distinguished magus with a history.
They are called the "Second Owner", an elite, and the Association entrusts the area to them.
Magi who would live in the area must visit them and obtain their permission to construct a workshop.

...Looking at it like that, we're thieves living here without the permission of the landlord.
Father was an outlaw who cut his ties with the Association and moved here without the consent of the administrator of Fuyuki.

The Owner doesn't know that Emiya Kiritsugu was a magus, and Kiritsugu didn't know who the Owner was.
With reasoning like that, I think our position is ambiguous.

Father, the real magus, has passed away.
And I, his son and pupil, don't know the Magic Association and have not the skill to be a magus.
...From the Association's point of view, they would want to catch an amateur like me doing things, but I've seen no movement yet.
No, I've heard that Japan is relatively hidden from the eyes of the Association, so I think I've just not been found out.

But that doesn't mean I can let my guard down.
People say that the eyes of the Association are everywhere. On top of that, if you commit a crime with magic, the heretic hunters of the church will come after you.
...That just means that whatever you use magic for, lack of care will create enemies.
I, Emiya Shirou, just have to study independently, taking that into account

"...Hm."
I wake up to see the sun shining in through the window.
The sun may have just risen as it's still a bit dark outside.
"...Hm. I'm really not good in the mornings."
I get up, trying not to be defeated by the morning chill, and quickly fold up my futon.

It's five thirty.
One of my strengths is waking up at this time, no matter how late I go to sleep. I do sometimes make mistakes and wake up late like yesterday, but I usually wake up early.
I think alarm clocks are degenerate, so I haven't used one since I was a kid.

"Alright, breakfast..."
Since I let Sakura do all the work yesterday, I have to return the favor this morning.
I should finish preparing before Sakura arrives.

I cook rice and make some miso soup.
It was radish and carrot yesterday, so I make onion and potato miso soup today.
I also make the usual broth egg and broth boil, and I'm done.
I cut and salt the saury, and stop just before cooking it.

"All right, that should do."
It's almost six o'clock.
I finished earlier than expected, so I have some extra time.
So, what should I do?

1) I'll do my daily routine at the dojo.
2) I'll make one more side dish since Sakura's coming.
I return to Miyama City.
Unlike Shinto, it's really quiet here as if it were midnight already.

"I wonder if Sakura's okay."
She seemed to be feeling better, but since she came to my place to make dinner, I think I've made her push herself again.

"I guess I'll go check on her."
It's not like I'll achieve anything by going to her house now, but it should make me feel better than doing nothing.

There's nothing wrong at her house.
There's no sign of the "strange foreigner" Sakura was talking about, and the lights are on only in Sakura and Shinji's rooms as usual.

"Huh?"
...Wait a minute.
Then what was that light yesterday? Was there someone other than Sakura and Shinji in the house?

"Excuse me. Do you need something?"
"...!?"
I spin around.
...In the darkness of the night, as if hiding in the sound of the bugs, a figure is standing.

He's an unfamiliar old man.
He must be really old, but he has sharp eyes and a presence that doesn't match his small body.
Perhaps it is the difference in the years we have lived, but he has a dignity that pressures me.

"What is wrong, young one, why don't you answer? If you don't answer, I shall jump to conclusions. Hmm, so, can I assume you're the stranger Sakura was talking about?"
Sakura...?
...Then, could this person be....

"Geez. Since it is my granddaughter's wish, I can't just let you go. I'm sorry, but I will have to hurt you a bit.
Just to be sure, you don't intend to hand yourself over to the police graciously?"

The unknown old man asks me such a question.
T-There's no mistake.
This is the first time I've met him, but he must be...

"Ah... no, you've got it wrong...! My name is Emiya Shirou. I'm in the same class as Shinji, and I'm an acquaintance of Sakura, and I just came to see how they were doing...!"

"Oh. I see, you're their friend. Then I'm sorry for stopping you. Well, I can go and get them. Or would you like to have dinner with us?"

"N-No, I was just stopping by, so I'll be going. By the way, is Sakura home already?"
"Zouken."
The old man says an unfamiliar word.

"Huh?"
"Matou Zouken. It is wrong for me to not name myself when you have done so."
Matou Zouken says so and walks toward the entrance.
It seems like he doesn't care about me any more.
"......"
Overwhelmed, I see him off without a word.

...And then.
"Sakura is home.
More importantly, Emiya Shirou. Is the daughter of the Einzberns doing well?"

"...Huh? Ein-what?"
"Do not play dumb. It is natural for the daughter of the Einzberns to go and see Emiya. I am asking you how well it is this time around."
"...???"
Um, I don't understand at all.
...I'm sorry Sakura, but your old man is pretty hard to deal with.

"......Hm, it seems you really don't know."
Zouken sighs.
He looks so shocked that I feel kind of sorry for him.

"...Well, I don't really understand, but I'm sorry."
"No, no, it's nothing you should feel bad about. It was a mistake on my part. I'm sorry to bore you with such things.
Here, if you want to see my grandchildren, do not hesitate. The old man will go away, so please do not reserve yourself."

"Um, no, I really just stopped by today. ...But, um... do you live here?"
"I do. But as you can see, I am old. So I just lie in the rear tatami room all the time."

"......"
...I see.
I came to their house until about a year ago, but it seemed then that no one other than Sakura and Shinji lived there.

"Then excuse me, Emiya Shirou. Please stay friends with my grandchildren."
Despite his appearance, he leaves with light footsteps.
There is no change in the house.
But the sound of the bugs has suddenly stopped.

...The day ends.
Finishing a rowdy dinner and seeing Fuji-Nee off, I take a bath.
After that, I practice my daily routine in the shed.
I complete it as usual and go to sleep.
It is one in the morning.
The day ends peacefully with no troubles.
"Good morning, Senpai. Have you finished preparing breakfast already?"
"Yeah, breakfast is done. All that's left is setting up the table and cooking the fish."
"Oh, I'll help then. I'll prepare the dishes."

Sakura is cheerful.
And behind that admirable junior...
"Oh, this is the smell of Shirou's omelet. I see, you're making breakfast this morning."
Fuji-Nee moves slowly to the table.

"...Well, that aside..."
First, I have to cook the fish I've prepared.
"Sakura, can you use the dishes in the middle? That will make it look better."
"Huh.....? Um, this one with bumps?"

"Yeah, that. You have to think about the plates too or you'll be too one-sided. Oh, and the radish is already grated."
Sakura takes out a dish from the back.

I think I saw a faint bruise on her wrist when she leaned forward.

"Hold on, Sakura."
"Yes, what is it Senpai?"
"What's that mark on your wrist?"
"Oh..."
She looks away awkwardly.
And that tells me who caused that bruise.

"Shinji again, huh? What does he think he's doing, beating on his sister...!?"
"T-That's not it, Senpai...! Um, well... I fell and hurt myself. I'm a bit slow, you know?
So I fall and get hurt a lot."
"Don't be stupid. How can you get a bruise like that from falling over? It seems Shinji isn't tired of getting beat up yet...!"

"N-No, Senpai...! This doesn't have anything to do with Nii-san. I really did this myself, so you can't get mad."

Sakura falls silent.
...Sakura looks calm, but she is pretty obstinate. It's useless to say anything to her now.

"...All right. If you say so, I'll leave it at that. But if I see it again, I won't be able to hold back."
"...Yes. I'm sorry, Senpai."
"Why are you apologizing? It's Shinji's fault."
"......"
At the mention of Shinji's name, Sakura looks away awkwardly.

In other words, he is the cause of that bruise.
Matou Shinji has a bad habit of being hard on his sister, Sakura.
I first noticed it about a year ago.
Sakura was injured sometimes, and she just evaded my question when I asked about it.
When I asked Shinji about it, of all things, he said he was the one who hit Sakura.

When I asked him why he hit her, he said that he just hit her because he felt like it.
After that, I got pissed and did to Shinji what he did to Sakura.
Since then, we've been estranged.
I still don't regret punching him.
But I think it's my fault that Sakura is being treated worse.

"...Senpai, did you... um, work things out with Nii-san?"
"Huh? Yeah, I did. We didn't have a fight or anything, so it's not like there was anything to work out."
"...Uh, it might be like that for you, but Nii-san thinks you guys got in a fight. So... well, please be careful."

"Hm?"
Sakura says strange things sometimes.
"Be careful... you mean, of Shinji?"
"...Yes. I think Nii-san thinks of you as an enemy... um, and he thinks that you quit the club because of him...."

"That's not true. Me quitting the club had nothing to do with Shinji. Well, maybe a bit, but it's still not something you should worry about. Like Shinji says, this is certainly indecent."
I point at my right shoulder.
There's a scar there.

It happened a year and a half ago.
A shipment collapsed on me during work and I hurt my right shoulder. I got out with just a broken bone, but the shipment was a hazardous one and I got a burn on my skin.

After that accident, I quit the archery club.
My school archery club emphasizes formalities as they let us shoot formally even as students.
The men expose their right shoulder when they shoot.
Shinji commented that it might be indecent for someone shooting formally to have a scar on their shoulder. Since I was getting busy with work, I quit the archery club right then.

"Um, Senpai? I might be persistent, but are you really not shooting anymore? Fujimura-Sensei said your injury shouldn't be a problem."
"What are you saying!? Fuji-Nee wouldn't think it's a problem even if I broke every bone in my body."

"Senpai, I'm being serious."
Sakura glances up at me, like she wants to say something.
"...Hmm."
I should answer seriously too, but I can't give her the answer she wants.

"I don't have time to do club activities for now. I like archery, but it's not something I prioritize, so I'm taking some time off from it."
"...How long is 'some time'?"
"I guess until I feel like it. Well, I'll try to make it back before you graduate. Welcome me then, Sakura."
I pat Sakura's shoulder.

Sakura stares blankly for a while, and then...
"Oh, yes...! I'll be waiting, Senpai!"
And she nods so powerfully that it seems she might drop the plates she's holding.
Classes end and it's time to go home.
I cannot go anywhere as I have work today.
I should leave school and go straight to the neighboring town, but...


She moves faster than I can think.
The knightly girl leaps out of the shed without hesitation.

"...!"
I get up and follow the girl, even forgetting the pain in my body.
There's no way that girl will be a match for him.
Even armored like that, she is a girl smaller than me.

"Sto!"
My words are silenced by the sound.
"Wha...?"
I can't believe my eyes.
This time, my head really goes blank.

"What is she?"
The sound of weapons.
The moon is hidden behind the clouds and the yard has returned to its original darkness.
In it, sparks are born from steel hitting steel.

The lance-wielding man wordlessly attacks the girl who jumped out of the shed.
But the girl parries the blow of the lance and knocks away all following attacks, driving the man back with every blow.

"......"
I... can't believe it.
The girl called Saber is overpowering that man.

The battle has begun.
What happened between me and him earlier wasn't a battle.
A battle is a fight between two people who can kill each other.
Whatever the difference in skills, if each has a way to kill the other, then you can call it a battle.

Their fight is a battle in that sense too.
The man's lance that I couldn't even see is thrown with even more power.
But...
The girl parries it with the "thing" in her hands and closes in on the man.

"Damn...!"
The man retreats a bit.
He holds his lance vertically to protect his ribs as the girl goes for them.

"Guh...!"
For a moment, the man's lance glows.
It was a blow like an explosion, and I guess it really was one.
The instant the man blocks the "thing" the girl's holding, the lance in his hand glows as if electrified.
The man, and even I, can tell what that is.

That is a force of magical energy so strong that it's visible.
In each of the girl's blows is a terrible amount of magical energy.
That outrageous amount of magical energy is penetrating the opponent's weapon just by touching it.

Such a thing... it must take such force just to block it.
If you think of the man's lance as an accurate sniper rifle, the blows of the girl are like those of a powerful shotgun.
Every time the girl swings, the yard is filled with light.

But...
That isn't what's overpowering the man.

"Coward, what are you doing, hiding your weapon...!"
The man complains while avoiding the girl's fierce attacks.
"......"
The girl doesn't answer, but only attacks even more with the "thing" in her hands...!

"You...!"
The man retreats with not even a chance for a counterattack.
That's only natural.
Because the girl's weapon is invisible.
As he cannot sense her range, it would be careless to attack recklessly.

Yes, it is invisible.
The girl definitely has "something" in her hand.
But as you can't see what shape it is nor how long it is, you can't tell anything about it.
Perhaps it's totally invisible, as it does not show up even when sparks fly off from it.

"Damn."
The man must be having a hard time defending against it, as his moves aren't as sharp.


And the girl lets out a voice for the first time.
She swings her "weapon" with more fury.
A storm of swings without pause!
The flying sparks remind me of a blacksmith hitting iron.

The lance-wielding man blocks them, clucking his tongue.
I must say, I admire his skills even though he tried to kill me.
The man is blocking invisible blows, watching only the opponent's legs and arms!

"Fuh...!"
But that's it.
You only need to beat down someone who's gone defensive.
As if to say so, the girl steps even closer to the man and...
Delivers a blow with all her might, as if smashing him down...!

"Don't underestimate me, fool...!"
He must see this as his opportunity as the man disappears.
No, he jumped back, making it look like he disappeared.
The girl's blow cuts through air and destroys the ground, kicking up dust.
The blow, swung as a final one, was easily dodged!

"Idiot, what is she doing...!?"
I can tell even from a distance.
I don't know about the careful blows from before, but such a big blow won't be able to touch that man.

Even that man's body must have been straining under all those attacks.
But he suppressed it for an instant, and jumped away.
As if this blow will determine the victor...!

"Ha...!"
The man who jumped back several meters jumps as soon as he lands.
As if reversing his retreat, he jumps at the girl.
In contrast, the girl still has her sword in the ground.

"...!"
That opening is irrevocable.
The red lance returns in less than a second, and...
The girl twirls her body with the sword still in the ground.

"...!"
So the contest lasts less than a second.
The man sees his mistake and tries to hold back, while the girl uses her whole body to execute her blow!

"Guh...!!"
"......"
The man blown away and the girl who blew him away both seem discontent.
It's only natural.
They each launched their blows to kill the other.
Even if they allowed them to escape immediate danger, they were worthless.

Their distance opens.
The two stare at each other silently.

"What is wrong, Lancer?
It would not do your name credit if you just stand there. If you will not come, I can."

"...Hah, you're going to come and die? I don't mind, but let me ask you this first.
Your Noble Phantasm, is it a sword?"
The man glares, as if staring right into her heart.

"Who knows?
It might be a battle axe or it might be a spear. It might even be a bow, Lancer."
"Heh, keep talking, Saber."
Perhaps it's really funny for him.
The man... the one called Lancer lowers his lance.
It looks like he's indicating that he doesn't want to fight anymore.
"...?"
The girl is puzzled by Lancer's action.
But I know that stance.
It was used in that fight a few hours ago in the schoolyard.
It's the fatal move that was supposed to have ended the show.

"...I'll ask just in case since this is our first meeting. Do you want to call it even?"


"It's not a bad deal, right? See, that senile Master over there is useless, and it so happens my Master is a coward.
I think it's in both our interests to hold off on this match until we're better prepared."

"I refuse. You will fall here, Lancer."

"I see. Geez, all I wanted to do was check things out, you know? I didn't want to stay long once a Servant came out."
It seems like the air around them distorted.

Lancer lowers his stance.
A chill runs through the air at that moment.
It's exactly like back then. The magical energy rumbles in a whirlpool, centered on that lance.

"Noble Phantasm...!"
The girl readies her apparent sword and glares at the enemy in front of her.
The girl, facing the enemy, knows better than I how dangerous he is.

"...See ya. I'll take that heart of yours!"
The beast jumps.
Lancer instantly appears in front of the girl, as if he teleported, and...
Thrusts his lance at the girl's feet.


It was a bad move, even to my eyes.
With the lance already lowered, it wouldn't be effective to aim low at the girl.
To prove my point, the girl jumps over the lance and moves forward to slash Lancer away.
At that moment.

"Gae..."
With words themselves charged with magical energy...
"Bolg...!"
The lance thrust at the girl's feet rushes towards her heart.

"...!?"
Her body rises into the air.
The girl is driven up into the air by the blow of the lance, and she crashes down... no, lands on the ground.

"Ha, kuh...!"
...She's bleeding.
The girl, who hasn't even received a scratch so far, is bleeding badly from her chest.

"A curse... no, a reversal of causality...!"
She speaks in pain.
...I'm surprised too.
No, since I saw it from a distance, I can tell better than her that the attack just now was a strange one.

The lance was definitely aimed at her feet.
But it suddenly changed its course, moving strangely in an impossible direction, and pierced the girl's heart.
But the lance itself has not grown or bent.
It looked so natural that it makes one think that the lance was already in her heart... and for that reason, it's strange.

It's not as simple as the lance changing its course and piercing her heart.
The lance did not change its course, but changed the means so that the result would be so.

...The lance thrust with that name carried the "result" of "piercing her heart" as a premise.
In other words, the process and the result were reversed.
As long as there was the result of the lance piercing her heart, the course of the lance was merely something added later to prove that fact.

An evil thorn that breaks through all defenses.
A lance that pierces the heart every time it's used, a weapon that determines your fate just by its use.
How can anyone block such a ridiculous attack?
However the enemy tries to dodge it, the lance will pierce their heart without fail.
That's why this move is fatal.
A cursed lance that always pierces the opponent with one thrust.

But...
The girl has evaded it by a small margin.
She is wounded, but it was not a fatal blow.
In a sense, her actions were more impossible than the lance.
The instant the lance was thrust, she turned and jumped back with all her might, as if she knew this was going to happen.

Either she had incredible luck or enough divine protection to nullify the curse of the lance.
Either way, she avoided a fatal blow and sullied the lance's name.

"Haa, haa"
The girl catches her breath.
The blood that was running so much has stopped, and even her stabbed wound is healing.

"......"
I guess that's extraordinary.
I knew she wasn't normal, but still, that's too strange.

Like her skills to fight against Lancer, like the incredible magical energy in each of her blows, and like her body that heals by itself... this girl clearly surpasses Lancer.

...But that was only up to now.
Even if it's healing, her wound is deep.
If Lancer attacks her now, she'll be defeated without even being able to defend herself.

But.
With this overwhelming advantage, Lancer doesn't move.
He glares at the girl, grinding his teeth so hard that I can hear it.

"You evaded it, Saber. My fatal Gae Bolg."
A voice that seems to echo from the ground.

"...!? Gae Bolg... you are Ireland's man of light!"
Lancer frowns.
His hostility disappears and he clucks his tongue in annoyance.

"...I screwed up. If I'm going to use this move, it needs to be fatal. Geez, I guess being too famous is bad too...."
The pressure goes away.
Lancer doesn't even attack the wounded girl and simply turns his back and moves to the edge of the yard.

"It is the rule of Servants to fight to the death if your identity is discovered... but unfortunately, my Master is a coward. He's telling me to go back since you have evaded my lance."
"You are running away, Lancer?"

"Yeah. I don't mind if you come after me, Saber.
Just be prepared to die when you do."
With one bound.
Lancer easily jumps over the wall and disappears.

"Wait, Lancer...!"
The wounded girl starts running to pursue the enemy.

"I-Is she stupid......!?"
I run through the yard with all my strength.
I think that the girl will go after him if I don't stop her instantly.
...But there was no need for that.
When the girl tries to jump over the wall, she clenches her chest and stops.

"Kuh...."
I run to her and stare at her.
No, I tried to approach her to call out to her, but I forget about it the instant I come near her.


...To put it simply, everything about her is absurd.
Now that I'm near her, I can tell that the shining armor she wears is really heavy.
The old-fashioned cloth is smooth, a vivid blue.

...No, that isn't what fascinates me.
The girl, who seems to be a few years younger than me, is beautiful.
The golden hair lit by the moonlight is finely textured, as if sprinkled with gold dust.
The face, with some sign of naivety, has elegance, and her white skin looks soft.


I can't call out to her because I am fascinated by her beauty, and also for another reason.

"...Why."
Because seeing the girl fighting and getting hurt somehow made me mad.
No matter how strong she is or how armored she is, I think it's wrong for a girl to have to fight.

All the while I'm fascinated with her, the girl has her hand on her chest.
But that ends quickly.
The girl lets her chest go and looks up as if the pain has gone away.
She stares directly at me.
I'm not sure how I should talk to her, but I notice something about her.

"...The wound is... gone...?"
Even though it missed her heart, that lance stabbed her in the chest. But she's unscathed.
...I've heard of healing magics, but I didn't see her using anything like that.
So that must mean she automatically heals even when she is wounded.

"...!!"
Then my brain switches gear.
This is no time to be fascinated by her. She is a strange being. I can't let my guard down until I know what she is.

"Who... are you?"
I take half a step back and ask her.

"...? What do you mean? I am the Servant Saber.
...You summoned me, so I do not think you should need to confirm it."
The girl answers in a quiet voice.

"The Servant Saber...?"
"Yes, so please call me Saber."
She replies without hesitation.
Her tone is polite yet gentle, and just hearing it makes my head go blank...
"...!!"
...Hey, what am I getting excited about...!?

"I-I see. That's a strange name."
I hide my burning face with my hand and reply really stupidly. I don't know what else to say.
I wouldn't know of any such thing to say. Since I asked her name, isn't it natural for her to introduce herself? In that case, it would be impolite to stay silent like this.

"...I'm Shirou. My name is Emiya Shirou, and I live in this house."
What am I doing?
Are my answers getting stupider?
But she told me her name, so I should answer too.
I know I'm confused right now, but I have to be polite no matter who this is.

"......"
The girl... Saber just stares at me without changing her expression.

"No, wait. I take that back. That's not what I meant to ask you. Actually..."
"I know. You are not a formal Master, correct?"
"Huh...?"
"But you are still my Master. As long as we have made a contract, I will not betray you. There is no need for you to be so cautious."

"Uh...?"
Crap.
I can hear her words, but they make no sense to me.
All I know is that she's calling me with a ridiculous word like "Master".

"That's wrong. My name isn't 'Master'."
"Then I shall call you Shirou. Yes, I like the sound of that better."

"...!"
As soon as she says my name, I think my face lit up on fire.
Shouldn't you call someone by their last name on a first meeting...!?

"Wait a minute. Why are you calling me
Ow...!"
Pain suddenly runs through my left hand.

"I-It's burning......!"
The back of my hand is burning.
My hand feels like it's in a fire, and on it is a strange mark that looks like a tattoo.

"What the..."
"That is called a Command Spell, Shirou.
It is the three claims on a Servant's obedience, and the life of a Master. Please do not use it thoughtlessly."

"W-Who..."
Before I can finish with "are you?", the air around her changes.

"Shirou, heal my wounds."
She speaks in a cold voice.
It seems her attention is on something far away, behind the wall, and not on me.
But is she expecting me to heal her...?

"Wait, you're asking me? I'm sorry, but I don't know any such difficult magic. Besides, it's already healed."
Saber frowns a bit.
...I think I said something really wrong there.

"...Then I shall face them as I am now. The regeneration only healed the outside, but one more fight should not be a problem."
"...? One more what...?"

"There are two enemies outside. Judging by their presence, it should only take a few seconds to defeat them."
Saying so, Saber jumps lightly.
Just like Lancer, she leaps over the wall and disappears outside.
I'm left alone in the yard.

"...Enemies outside?"
As soon as I say it aloud, I realize what it means.
"Hold on, are you going to fight again...!?"
My body starts to move.
Without thinking, I run to the gate with full force.

"Haa, haa, haa...!"
I run to the gate, unlock it with trembling hands, and jump outside.

"Saber, where are you...!?"
I search through the dark.
The moon is hidden, now of all times, and it is completely dark.
But...

I hear something nearby.
"There...!?"
I run to the small road with no sign of anyone on it.

It all happens in an instant.
Saber is confronting a familiar guy in red.
Saber runs at the man in red without takes his guard down with one blow, and...
I leave Sakura, who has club activities, and head to the school building.
The schoolyard is full of spirited students running around.

"......"
But still, there's something oddly wrong here.
The school is like it always is.
The students at morning practice are lively, and the new school building is spotless.

"...Maybe it's just my imagination."
But when I close my eyes, the air completely changes.
The school building is covered with stains like membranes, and the students running around the schoolyard seem like empty dolls.

"...Maybe I'm just tired."
I shake my head to clear it.
I head to the lifeless building.

School ends early on Saturdays.
Classes end before noon, and after I finish helping Issei afterwards, the sun is starting to set.
"Well, let's head home."
I pack up and leave my classroom.

And then.
"Oh, you're still here, Emiya?"
I bump into Shinji.
There are a couple of girls behind him, being rowdy.

"You were still here even though you had nothing to do? Oh yeah, you were sticking up for the student council again, right? I envy you. You can get good reports from the school without doing any club activities."
"I'm not helping the student council. It's only natural for a student to fix the school equipment, right? After all, we're the ones using them."

"Heh, keep talking like that. For you, everything is natural. Didn't I tell you that I hate how you act like a good kid?"
"Hm? ...Sorry, I don't remember that. I thought that was just the sort of thing you say, so I didn't really notice it."

"...!!
Heh, fine. Then you're going to fix everything at this school?"
"Fixing everything would be impossible. The most I can do is take care of things."

"All right, then do me a favor. Our archery club is in kind of a mess right now.[l]
It's a bit disordered, and some of the bows need strings attached.
If you have time, can you do that too? You used to be a member. Don't just stick to the student council, and you should be useful to us sometimes as well."

"What? Senpai, didn't Fujimura-Sensei tell you to do that?"
"That's right. You'll be scolded tomorrow if you don't do it properly."
"But the shop will close if I start cleaning now. It's fine if he does it, right?"
"I don't know. Besides, an outsider wouldn't know how."
"Are you sure? Shinji said he used to be in the archery club, so we can let him do it."

They're getting rowdy behind Shinji.
It seems they're in the archery club, but they must be members that Shinji recruited recently as I don't know them.

"I'll leave it to you, then. The key's in the usual place, so go ahead. You don't mind, right Emiya?"
"No. I have some free time, so this isn't a bad thing to do once in a while."
"Haha, thanks! Let's go, everyone. He says he'll do the boring chores for us!"

"Oh, wait Senpai! Oh yes, please take care of the cleaning, Senpai."

The cleaning ends quite easily as I know the place well.
It took a while as it is quite big, but it was fun cleaning the place I used until a year and a half ago.

I picked up a bow thinking it might be okay to shoot just once, but since it wasn't mine, I decided not to.
If I ever want to, I can just bring my own bow and come here.

"...But there are so many more carbon bows now. There was only one when I was in my first year."

Carbon-based bows are good, unlike wood and plastic bows.
But the biggest problem is the price, and they're not something we could buy with the club budget.
Back then, Shinji was the only one using it... are the new members rich too?

"...What a waste. You can modify a wooden bow a lot more."

Well, I guess that's personal taste right there.
When I look at the clock, it's way past curfew.
It's a little after seven o'clock. The gates should be closed by now, so there's no reason to rush now.

...But still.
Was this dojo always this dirty? There are loads of places that look unkept.

"...Well, another hour or two won't matter now that I've done this much."
I've started this, so I'll finish the job.

The wind is blowing.
It's so cold that my cheeks are getting numb.
...Fuyuki City isn't usually cold during the winter, but it is cold tonight of all nights.


My breath hangs around as a white cloud.
I wrap up my body to hold off the cold.

"No wonder it's dark... the moon's behind the clouds."
There's no light in the sky when I look up.
Because of the strong winds, the clouds are moving fast.
It's past curfew and there's no sign of life in the empty school.

It seems this place is filled only with chill, as it's all silent.
"...?"
Just now...
I think I hear something.

"I do hear something. Is it coming from the school grounds...?"
This night.
I must have been curious about the sound that broke the silence.
To investigate it, I find myself heading there even though I somehow know that I mustn't.

I go to the schoolyard.
"...People?"
Well, they only look like that from a distance.
It's a dark night with no light.
If I want to know more, I'll have to go closer to the schoolyard.

I can hear the sounds louder now. It's the sound of metal hitting metal. That must mean someone is fighting with weapons there.

"...That's stupid. What the hell am I thinking...?"
I dismiss the image from my mind with a bitter smile and walk on.

At that time.
Maybe my instincts noticed the danger, as I hid myself as I approached. I don't know if this is fortunate or not.
But anyways, when I get by a tree that is big enough to hide myself, I take a closer look at the source of the sound
My mind stops completely.

"What the..."
There's something strange there.
A man in red and a man in blue.
They are dangerously armed, and as their ominous appearance suggests, they are actually slashing at each other.

I can't understand.
I can't follow them with my eyes.
My brain does not work properly, faced with their impossible movements.
But the clang of their weapons tells me they are trying to kill each other.


I just knew immediately when I saw them...
They are not human. They are probably just things that look like humans.
I can tell not because I'm learning magic.
Anyone would realize they're not human.
After all, humans can't move like that.
So they are something no one should associate with.

I can feel their murderous intent even from a distance.
...I'm going to die.
My body understands faster than my brain that I will definitely die if I stay here.
That's why my heart is racing so fast.
As a living thing like them, I sense that they're living things made only to kill.

...They're using weapons made only to kill.
I remember the murder yesterday.
They said the family was killed with some weapon like a sword.
"...!"
I shouldn't watch any longer.
But my body won't follow my commands and I can't even breathe.
My mind wants to run away, but my judgment tells me I'll be seen the moment I run away.
...More than the conflict within me, my body is just numb.
Even though I'm a good forty meters away, I can't breathe properly, and it's like I have a spear pointed right at my back.

The sounds stop.
The figures separate and stand facing each other.
The moment I feel relief at the end of their battle, I sense an even stronger intention to kill.

"......!!"
My heart stops.
The numbness in my body becomes convulsions, and I clench my teeth to try to hold my trembling body.

"What the hell is he!?"
An overwhelming amount of magical energy is flowing into the guy in blue.
Kiritsugu showed me once what it's like to draw in magical energy from the surroundings.
It was a beautiful magic that impressed even an amateur like me.

But that thing is different.
Just as even the simple task of drinking water could seem ugly if it goes too far, what he is doing is so excessive that anyone with knowledge of magical energy would hate it.


He's going to die.
The guy in red is going to die.
It's a blow with that much concentrated magical energy. There's no way he'll be able to survive it.

He'll die.
He's not human, so something merely like a human will die.
That is...

That's...

That's... something I can just ignore?

That doubt takes my mind off of them.
The binds on my body disappear, and the instant I take a deep breath...
"Who's there!?"
The guy in blue stares at me, who's hiding.

"...!!"
The blue guy's body sinks.
Just that motion tells me that I'm his target now.

"Ahhh...!"
My legs start running automatically.
I finally realize that it is an action to escape death, and I put all the energy in my body into running away.

I don't know how fast I run, but before I know it, I'm in the school building.

"How stupid of me."
I regret my actions, panting heavily.
I should have run into town to get away.
What am I doing, fleeing to such a deserted place?

And a school, of all things. Isn't there some better place to hide than here?
Anyways, why do I think I'll be killed if I don't escape?

"HaaHaa, haa..."
My heart aches from running so much.
Turning around, I can sense nothing pursuing me.
The only sound in the air is the sound of my footsteps.

"Ah... haa, haa."
So, I can finally rest.
I stop my feet, unable to take another step, send oxygen to my pumping heart, and look up to finally realize that I am safe.

"...Man... what was that...?"
I recall the scene from earlier while catching my breath.
Anyway, I'm sure that it wasn't something I should have seen.

Some things like humans were fighting in the school grounds.
That's all I can remember.
But there was something else I saw, out of the corner of my eye.
"...Wasn't there someone else too...?"
But I can't remember what that figure looked like.
To be honest, I didn't have the composure to notice anything other than those two fighting.

"Well, anyways..."
"The chase is over, right?"
The voice comes from right in front of me.

"Yo. You ran pretty far."
He speaks in a friendly tone.

"......"
I can't breathe.
My brain stops, and even though I cannot think...
...I vaguely understand that I am going to die.

"You know better than anyone that you can't escape, right? People who get killed are usually like that. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. You don't have to feel ashamed."
The lance is casually raised.

"You were just unlucky, kid. Well, you saw us, so die."
And the man's lance mercilessly pierces Emiya Shirou's heart.

There wasn't even time to dodge it.
All the training I did was for nothing.
I knew I was going to be killed.
I knew I was going to be pierced by that lance, yet I could not move at all.

"Aa... ah."
The world distorts.
My body grows cold.
Feeling vanishes from my fingertips.
"Gah..."
I cough up blood, once.

More blood should have come up, but it only happens once.
Perhaps the man's lance is special.
The blood slowly clots and the heart that should have exploded stops working with just a single pierce.


I can't see well.
There's no feeling in me.
I feel like a jellyfish floating in the dark sea at night.
I don't feel any pain already.
The world is white, and only I am black.
So, rather than feeling like I'm dead, it's more like the world around me has disappeared.

I know this.
I felt this ten years ago.
This is how someone feels when dying.

"Dead men tell no tales. It's only natural for the weak to die, but..."
I cannot concentrate on my vision.

"Man, you really make me do unpleasant jobs. It's a joke that a hero is acting like this."
I can only hear voices.

"I know, I have no complaints. I saw the girl's Servant, so I'll go back."
A voice filled with irritation.
And after that, I hear footsteps running through the hallway.

"Archer, huh? I want to finish the match with him, but I have to follow my Master's plan. ...Geez, I don't like him."
The voice suddenly disappears.
I guess he jumped out of a window or something.
And after that...

Footsteps approach me and stop.
In that brief period.
...More footsteps.
I can't... hear... much... now...

"...Follow him, Archer. Lancer will probably go back to his Master. This won't be worth it unless we at least find out what his Master looks like."

...Whose voice was that?
I concentrate my fading mind, but I can't remember anything.
Right now, my breathing is too noisy.
My lungs must still be alive.
The air coming out of my mouth is as loud as a hurricane.

"...But it's amazing he isn't dead yet."

I sense someone looking at my face.
Perhaps my breathing was loud as the figure tries to close my mouth and...

"...Stop it. Why does it have to be you?"
I hear the person grit their teeth, then they touch me without hesitation.

"...Reforge the damaged organ and use it as a substitute, and restore the heart in the process, huh? If I succeed, I'll be accepted to the Clock Tower instantly...."
A pain-filled voice.
With that, my mind stops fading.


Feeling returns to my body.
Slowly, bit by bit, like a drop of water going down a leaf, feeling returns to my body.


What is the person doing?
The person is sweating and places their hand on my chest with all their heart.


When I notice, the place where the person placed their hand is terribly hot.
It must be so hot that the frozen blood melted and started to flow again.

"Phew."
I sense someone take a deep breath and sit down.
"I'm tired..."
I hear a clang of something falling.
"...Well, I guess it can't be helped. Forgive me, Father. Your daughter is terribly heartless."

And that's it.
The person speaks to mock themself, and leaves.


My heart resumes its activity.
And then, my mind stops.
...This is not the sleep of death.
This is a restful sleep, to recover the energy to wake up again.
We walk through the nighttime town.
It's past one in the morning and there's no one out at this time.
The lights in the houses are out, and only the streetlamps illuminate the silent town.

"Hey Tohsaka, are you planning to walk to the neighboring town?"
"Yeah. The buses and trains have stopped running. A walk at night is good once in a while, right?"
"I see, then if I may ask, do you know how long it takes to get there?"
"Well, it should take about an hour walking. If it gets late, we can always take a taxi."

"I won't waste that kind of money. And besides, what I mean is, it might be dangerous for girls to walk around at a time like this. You know it's dangerous, right? I won't be responsible if something happens."
"Don't worry, nobody's going to mess with us. You may be forgetting, but Saber is really strong."

"Oh."
She's right.
Whoever it is, if someone attacks her, they will be counterattacked viciously.

"Rin. What was Shirou saying? I did not quite understand."
"Huh? Well, he was just making a big misunderstanding or being plain stupid. He's saying he'll help us if some pervert appears."

"What? Shirou is my Master. I should be protecting him instead."
"I don't think he's thinking about that sort of thing. He seems unconcerned about magi and Servants and all. I kind of wonder what's going on in his head."
"......"

Tohsaka and Saber now know each other well enough to talk to each other.
Saber has been silent ever since I stopped her from going out dressed like she was.

She said she wouldn't take off her armor, so I made her wear a raincoat, and she's been quiet ever since.
Now, she follows me and only speaks to Tohsaka.

"Wait, where are you going, Emiya-kun? Isn't that the wrong way?"
"We need to get to the bridge, right? Then this will be a shortcut."
I don't want to walk alongside them, so I quickly make my way to the small side-road.
They follow me without objection.

We come out into a park.
We have to cross that bridge to go to the neighboring town of Shinto, but

"Wow, I didn't know about this road. I see, since you can get to the bridge from the park, all you have to do is head for the park."
Tohsaka looks up at the bridge, talking happily.

Maybe it's just because it's nighttime.
Tohsaka's face, looking up at the bridge, seems even more beautiful than at school... I'm troubled.

"Let's go. We didn't come here to play around."
I hurry Tohsaka, who is standing still in the park, and make my way up the stairs.
Once we reach the road alongside the bridge, Shinto will be straight ahead of us.

There's no one on the bridge.
That's only natural as not many people use it even during daytime.
It's more normal to use the bus or the train to get to the neighboring town, so this bridge is rarely used.

That's because it's so long and it carries a fear that it might collapse on you.
That must be why this place isn't used for dates, even though it's perfect location-wise.

"...That's stupid. What am I thinking?"
Saber is following me silently and Tohsaka is walking right beside me.
Trying to ignore them, I hurry across the bridge.

Beyond the bridge, Tohsaka leads us into the suburbs.
When I think about Shinto, only the office buildings in front of the station come to mind, but there are streets from older times once you get away from the station.

The suburbs are the most extreme of those.
There are hilly roads and a high ground overlooking the sea.
As you go farther up the hill, there are fewer buildings and the foreigners' cemetery built on the slope of the hill can be seen.

"The church is up here. You must have been there at least once, right?"
"No. I know it used to be an orphanage though."
"I see. Then it'll be your first time today. You should prepare yourself. The priest there is a difficult man to deal with."

Tohsaka starts up the hill.
...Looking up, I can see a building at the top of the hill.
A church atop the hill.
I never thought I'd visit God's house for the first time for a reason like this.

"Wowthis is really awesome."
The church is magnificent.
The whole top of the hill must be the church's land as a flat field welcomes me as soon as I reach the top.
The church isn't that big, but it is compelling, towering over its visitors.

"Shirou, I will remain here."
"Huh? Why? I can't just leave you when we've come up here together."

"I did not come for the church. I followed to protect you. If your destination is the church, you should not go any farther, so I shall wait here for your return."
Saber says clearly.
It doesn't seem like she'll budge an inch, so I decide to respect her decision.

"All right. Then I'll be going."
"Yes. Please do not let your guard down whomever you are facing, Master."

It is a large, impressive chapel.
Since it's so large, many people must come here during the day.
If he's entrusted with such a church, the priest here must be a man of character.

"Tohsaka, what kind of a person is the priest here?"
"It's kind of hard to explain. I've known him for ten years, but I still can't grasp his character."
"You've known him for ten years...? That's a pretty long relationship. Is he a relative of yours or something?"

"He's not my relative, but he is my guardian. On top of that, he is my senior as an apprentice, and my second teacher."
"Huh... senior as an apprentice, you mean apprentice as a magus!?"

"That's right, but why are you so surprised?"
"Because he's a priest! Aren't priests forbidden to use magic!?"
By their nature, a magus and the church cannot be in harmony.

The organization that magi belong to is called the Magic Association,And the other side of religion, the side you wouldn't see while living a normal life, is called the Holy Church.
The two are barely similar. They cooperate in name, but they're always trying to kill each other when given the chance.

The church hates heretics.
They totally eliminate the inhuman, and they count magic-using humans among their targets.
For the church, miracles are only given to the chosen holy saints. Any miracles handled by other people are heresies.

There are no exceptions, even for those within the church.
The higher one rises in the church, the more one is prohibited from the impurity of magic.
And for a follower entrusted with a church like this and the more divine protection one receives, the more one should stay away from magic

"...No, first of all, is the priest here on our side?"
"Yes. He is the one supervising the Holy Grail War after all. He is a real Agent. ...Well, I don't know if he has divine protection, though."

Tohsaka's footsteps echo as she approaches the altar.
It's bad manners to do that when the priest isn't here, but it's so late at night.
He won't be in the chapel, so if he's anywhere, it will be the private room in the back.

"...Hmm. So who is this priest? You said a name like Kotomine before..."

"His name is Kotomine Kirei. He's a student of my father, and we've had an inseparable relationship for ten years now. ...Well, I wish I'd never met him, though."
"I feel the same way. I did not want an apprentice who did not respect her teacher."

A footstep.
He must have noticed our entry as he slowly appears from the other side of the altar.

"You didn't answer my repeated calls, and now you bring a strange guest. ...Hmm, so he is the seventh one, Rin?"

"Right. He's a magus, but he's pretty much a beginner, so I just couldn't let him be.
...I believe it was the rules to report here when one becomes a Master, right? It's a rule you invented, but I'll follow it this time."

"Very well. Then I must thank this young man."
The priest called Kotomine slowly turns to me.


...Without realizing, I step back.
...He's not scary at all.
...I don't feel any hostility from him.
But this priest still has a presence that makes the air around him feel heavy.

"I am Kotomine Kirei, the one entrusted with this church.
What is your name, seventh Master?"
"Emiya Shirou. But I haven't agreed to this 'Master' thing yet."
I glare back at the priest, trying not to lose against his presence.

"EmiyaShirou."
"Huh?"
The weight on my back turns into a chill.
The priest slowly smiles as if he's met someone pleasant.
That smile.
It makes me

"I thank you, Emiya. You have brought Rin here. If it were not for you, she would not have come."
The priest makes his way toward the altar.
Tohsaka moves away from the altar and stands beside me.

"Then let us start. Emiya Shirou, you are Saber's Master, correct?"
"That's wrong. I certainly made a contract with her, but I don't understand this whole Master and Holy Grail War thing.
If a Master should be a proper magus, then you should go and choose a more suitable person."

"...I see. This is serious. Does he really know nothing, Rin?"
"I told you he's a beginner. Train him from the very first steps, will you? You're really good at that, right?"
Tohsaka urges the priest.

"Oh, I see, I see. That's how it is, huh?
I understand. This is the first time you have ever depended on me.
Emiya Shirou, I can never thank you enough."
Father Kotomine laughs.
Their conversation makes me feel uneasy.

"First, let us correct your misunderstandings.
Listen, Emiya Shirou. Master is not a role you can give to someone else nor is it something you can stop being once you are chosen.
Those who have those Command Spells carved on them cannot resign from being a Master. You must accept that fact."

"Why can't I quit?"
"The Command Spell is a holy mark. Becoming a Master is a trial placed upon you. You cannot escape it just because it is inconvenient.
You cannot be released from that pain until you obtain the Holy Grail.

If you wish to retire from being a Master, all you can do is obtain the Holy Grail and wish for it. If you do that, everything will be as you desire, Emiya Shirou.
Your wishes, even cleaning out all the mud inside of you, is possibleYes, it is even possible to start everything over again.

Therefore, you should desire it.
If the time comes, you will appreciate being chosen as a Master. If you wish to erase those burns that cannot be seen, all you have to do is to accept that holy mark."

"Wha"
I feel dizzy.
The priest's words don't make any sense.
They just confuse me more and more as I listen.
...But still, his words soak into my brain and clot like blood.

"Kirei, don't go off topic. I asked you to tell him the rules. I didn't ask you to open up his old wounds."
A voice cuts in.
"T-Tohsaka?"
That clears up my dizzy head.

"I see. It is pointless to say anything to these kinds of people, so I was trying to take away his morality while he still misunderstood.
...Heh, I guess it's true that compassion is not good for others. And I rather enjoyed it too."

"What? Does it do you good to help him?"

"Of course. Helping people means saving yourself in the end. ...Well, it won't do any good to preach to you now.

So, let us return to the main topic, Emiya Shirou.
The battle you have been dragged into is called the 'Holy Grail War'.
Have you learned from Rin that this is an all out war between seven Masters, using seven Servants?"

"...I did. It's some ridiculous thing where seven Masters kill each other, right?"
"Indeed. But we are not committing these inhuman acts because we want to.
Everything is a ritual to determine who is the most suitable to receive the Holy Grail.
Because of its greatness, we require trials to determine its owner."

...What trials?
I'll bet this priest doesn't think of this Holy Grail War thing as a "trial".

"Hold on. You keep saying 'Holy Grail War', but what is it? You can't possibly mean the actual Holy Grail, right?"

The Holy Grail.
A grail said to have received the blood of the Christ.
It is considered to be one of the greatest holy relics, and said to be capable of many miracles.

The most common rumor about it is that the one who obtains the Holy Grail will obtain the world.
...But that's just an invention. After all, the Holy Grail itself is almost something that "exists, but doesn't exist".

"A Holy Grail that makes wishes comes true" certainly appears in many folklores and legends around the world .
But that's it.
A fictional power that doesn't exist and isn't possible. That is the Holy Grail.

"So answer, Kotomine Kirei. Is the Holy Grail you're talking about really the Holy Grail?"
"Of course. The Holy Grail that appears in this town is real. As a proof, the great miracle of the Servants has occurred.

Summoning and controlling past heroes. No, a miracle close to resurrecting the dead is almost a sorcery.
A Holy Grail with this much power shall grant its owner unlimited power. The object's unreality is worthless in front of that truth."


So.
He means that even if it is a fake, it doesn't matter if it has powers that would overwhelm even the true Holy Grail.

"...All right. Let's assume there really is a Holy Grail. Then why is it required to do something like the Holy Grail War? We shouldn't be killing each other if the Holy Grail exists. If the Holy Grail is so great, we can all share its power."
"That is a fair argument, but we do not have such freedom.
Only one person can obtain the Holy Grail.
That is not something we chose, but what the Holy Grail has decided."

"The Holy Grail decides the seven Masters and summons the seven Servants.
I told you that this is a ritual. The Holy Grail chooses the people suitable to obtain it, and selects its appropriate owner by making them fight for it.
That is the Holy Grail Warthe ritual where those chosen by the Holy Grail kill each other to obtain it."


The priest speaks plainly.
I have no rebuttal, and I look down at my left hand.
...There is the mark they call the Command Spell.
It must mean that as long as I have this mark, I cannot quit being a Master.

"...I'm not convinced. Even though only one person can be chosen, I don't like the idea that all we can do is to kill the other Masters."
"Huh? Hold on. You're misunderstanding if you think that you have to kill them. There's no need to kill the Masters."

"Huh? But you said we have to kill each other. Kotomine said so too."
"You will kill each other."
"You be quiet, Kirei. Now, the Holy Grail in this town is in spirit form. It's not something with form, so it's something we have to call forth by a special ritualmeaning we have to materialize it.

We can call for it as magi, but since it is in spirit form, we cannot reach it. Do you understand what that means?"
"Yeah. Only spirits can touch spirits, right?
Oh, that's why you need the Servants...!"

"Exactly. To put it simply, the goal of the Holy Grail War is to eliminate all the Servants except your own. So there's no rule that you have to kill the Masters."


Man, she could have told me that earlier!
Honestly, Tohsaka and this priest were being mean.
...Now I'm relieved.
So even if we enter this Holy Grail War, Tohsaka's not going to die.

"I see. I guess that is one way to think.
Then let me ask you, Emiya Shirou. Do you think you can beat your own Servant?"

"...?"
Beat Saber?
That's impossible.
In the first place, magic is useless against her, and she is skilled with her sword.

"Then let me ask you one more thing. It is a boring question, but do you think you are superior to your Servant?"
"...??"
What's he saying?"
I can't beat Saber, so there's no way I'm superior to her.
For this question, my answer will always be that I am weaker than my Servant, so...

"Oh."
"That's right. Servants are hard to defeat even with a Servant. So what should you do?
See, it's such a simple solution. Servants can only exist with a Master. No matter how powerful the Servant is, the Servant will disappear if the Master dies. So..."

That's right, it's a natural solution.
No one would choose to take the hard way.
If you want to win, the most effective way to kill the Servants would be to kill their Masters instead.

"...Okay. I understand that killing the Master is an effective way to eliminate other Servants.
But then, if their Servant gets killed, does that make someone not a Master anymore? Only Servants can touch the Holy Grail, right? Then there is no point to a Master that doesn't have a Servant."

"No, the right to be a Master still remains as long as you have the Command Spell. A Master is a magus that can form a contract with Servants. As long as you have the Command Spell, you can form a contract with Servants.

The Servants whose Masters are killed do not disappear right away. They can stay in this world until their magical energy runs out. If such 'abandoned Servants' exist, a Master with no Servant can form a contract with them. That will allow them to rejoin the war.
That is why Masters kill other Masters. Because if you allow them to live, there is a risk that they will impede you in the future.

"...So what if you use up your Command Spell? Then you won't be able to form a contract with other Servants, and the freed Servant will go off with someone else too."
"Wait, that's"
"Yes, you're right. If you use up your Command Spell, you will be liberated from your duty as a Master.

...However, I do not think a magus exists that would waste a Command Spell that allows them to use such powerful magic.
If there exists such a magus, he isn't even an amateur, but just a chicken."
The priest laughs, as he knows what I'm thinking about.

"......"
I'm annoyed.
That priest is making fun of me. I think he's trying to provoke me.

"You must understand now. So we will finish the explanation of the rules.
Well then, let us return to the beginning, Emiya Shirou.
You said you have no intention of being a Master. Do you still feel that way?"

"If you want to abandon your responsibility as a Master, that is fine too.
As you have realized, you may use up your Command Spell to end your contract with Saber. In that case, I will guarantee your safety until the Holy Grail War ends."

[wrap ext="-...?"]"...? Hold on. Why do you have to guarantee my safety? I can protect myself."

"I do not have enough free time to care for you either, but this is one of the rules.
I have been dispatched to supervise the repeating Holy Grail War.
That is why I must minimize the victims of the war.
Protection of magi who lost their claims to being a Master is one of my biggest responsibilities as the supervisor."

"Repeating Holy Grail War...?"
Hold on.
Repeating... does he mean that this kind of battle has happened many times before...?

"What do you mean? The Holy Grail War didn't just start now?"

"Of course not. Do you think a supervisor would have been dispatched if it were so?
This church bears a duty to recover the holy relics, as we are the lowest of the special agencies. Originally, it was our goal to research and recover the holy cross, but here, we have a duty to investigate the Holy Grail.
We have to investigate the 726th Holy Grail that has appeared in this far eastern land. We must recover it if it is real, and dispute it if it is not."

"726th... that many Holy Grails?"
"Who knows? It just means that there have been at least that many things that seemed like one.

And one of those is the Holy Grail from the Holy Grail War observed in this town.
According to records, it is said that the first battle occurred about 200 years ago.
Since then, the battles between Masters have been repeating in a cycle of about 60 years.
This is the fifth Holy Grail War. Since the last one was ten years ago, this will be the shortest cycle yet."

"Whaare you guys insane? You guys have repeated this thing four times already...!?"
"I feel the same way. As you said, people have repeated this event many times.
Yes.
In the past, the Holy Grail Wars were terrible. Masters were driven by their desires, forgot their teachings as magi, and just killed each other indiscriminately.

I think you already know, but it is the highest crime for a magus to use his magic in public. A magus cannot allow his identity to be revealed to the public.
But Masters in the past have violated that.
The Magic Association dispatched a supervisor to caution them, but they only made it in time for the third Holy Grail War. The one dispatched then was my father. Do you understand now, boy?"

"...Yeah, I understand we need a supervisor.
But from what you said, isn't this Holy Grail War fundamentally bad?"
"Oh? How is it bad?"

"Because the past magi were people who would break the rules of the magi, right?
Then let's say this Holy Grail thing really exists. What will you do if the one who remains is someone who uses the Holy Grail selfishly? It's bad if such a thing is obtained by someone who has no problem killing others.
If it is the job of the Association to look after magi, then shouldn't you guys be punishing those kinds of people?"

I question, with a little hope.
But as I expected, Kotomine Kirei laughs.

"Of course not. There are no magi who will act outside their own interests. We only supervise the rules of the Holy Grail War. We do not care about what happens afterwards. The Association is not concerned about the kind of person that obtains the Holy Grail."
"That's ridiculous...! What if the Master that obtains the Holy Grail is the worst guy possible!?"

"It would be problematic, but we can do nothing. It is the Holy Grail that chooses its owner. And we do not have the power to stop a Master who has been chosen by the Holy Grail.
It is a grail that makes wishes come true, after all. The one who obtains it will be able to do as he pleases.
But if you do not want that, then all you have to do is win it yourself. That is the most reliable way, isn't it?"

Kotomine is trying to hold back his laughter.
It's like he's enjoying my clumsy inability to accept the facts.

"What's wrong, boy? I think that was a good idea, so will you not accept it?"
"...That's none of your business. Anyway, I don't have any reason to fight. I'm not interested in the Holy Grail, and I don't feel like a Master even if you tell me I am."

"Oh. So you are not concerned about what the winner of the Holy Grail would do, even if it leads to disaster?"

"That's"
...I can't answer that question.
Crap, his words are violent.
They force the truth onto me, whether I want it or not.

"That is fine, if you have no reason to fight. So you are not troubled by what happened ten years ago?"
"Ten years... ago...?"

"That's right. At the end of the last Holy Grail War, an unsuitable Master touched the Holy Grail. I do not know what that Master wished for. All we know is the results of the disaster that came afterwards."


      For an instant.
      That image of hell flashes in my head.

"Hold on. That can't be..."
"It is. It is an event that everybody in this town knows about, Emiya Shirou.
Five hundred killed or wounded. A hundred and thirty four buildings burned down. That inferno, still unexplained, is the remains of the Holy Grail War."


I feel sick.
My vision blurs.
I lose concentration and I can't focus my eyes.
My body stumbles.

But I hold myself firm.
I hold onto consciousness by clenching my teeth.
I hold back my nausea with the anger boiling up in me.

"Emiya-kun? What's wrong? You're pale white. ...I know it's not a comfortable story, but... if you want, we can take a rest for a while."

I must have looked terrible.
I think it's very rare for Tohsaka to be worried like that.

"Don't worry. I feel better after seeing your weird face."
"...Hey, just what is that supposed to mean?"
"Oh, I have no hidden intentions. I meant it literally, so don't worry about it."

"Well, fine... hey, that's worse, you big oaf!"
The school's number one honor student, Tohsaka Rin, smacks me in the head.
That does it.
With that, the nausea and anger go away.

"...Thanks. You really did help, so don't bully me too much. I have a few more things to ask about."
She looks like she hasn't hit me enough, but she still lets me continue.

"Oh, you still have questions? All right, let out everything you want to say."
He should know what I want to ask, yet he asks me to go on.
Fine.
Emiya Shirou won't lose to you.

"Then I'll ask. You said this is the fifth Holy Grail War. Then, has anyone ever obtained the Holy Grail?"
"Of course. A sad event like that annihilation doesn't happen every time."
"Then"

"Do not be hasty. It is easy just to obtain it. After all, the Holy Grail is managed in this church. If you speak of just touching it, I touch it every day."
"Huh?"
T-The Holy Grail is at this church...?

"Of course, it is only the vessel. It is empty. Rin said it earlier that the Holy Grail is in spirit form.
What we maintain is a well-made replica of the Holy Grail. We use this as the catalyst to draw down the real Holy Grail and transform it into a Grail that grants wishes. It's like the relationship between Servants and Masters. ...Yes, there was indeed a man who obtained the real Holy Grail temporarily, using that method."

"Then, was that Holy Grail real? No, what happened to the guy who obtained it?"
"Nothing. The Holy Grail was imperfectly completed. It was the result of a foolish man, affected by sentiment."

...?
With the previous pressure gone, the priest narrows his eyes as if in regret.

"...What do you mean? Didn't the Holy Grail appear?"
"It is easy to just make the Holy Grail appear. Once the seven Servants are present, the Holy Grail will appear in time. As Rin said, there is no need to kill other Masters.
But that does not complete the Holy Grail. That thing decides its own appropriate master. And for that reason, it could not be obtained by a man who avoided battles."

"Heh, so that just means it's useless to obtain the Holy Grail without settling matches with the other Masters.
The Master who obtained the Holy Grail first in the last war was just a chicken. He just ran away from the Holy Grail, saying that he didn't want to fight other Masters."

So saying, Tohsaka looks away from Kotomine.
"No way."
Does that mean Kotomine was one of the Masters in the last war, and that he retired because he refused to fight in spite of obtaining the Holy Grail...!?

"...Kotomine. You didn't fight?"
"I did until halfway. But I made a bad decision. As a result, I only obtained an empty Holy Grail.
Well, I guess that was my limit anyway. Because the other Masters were all monstrous. I lost my Servant first and was taken under my father's protection.

...Come to think of it, it was inappropriate for a son of the supervisor to be chosen as a Master.
Father died at that time. Since then, I have succeeded the role of the supervisor, and I protect the Holy Grail at this church."

Saying that, the priest called Kotomine Kirei turns around.
Before him stands the symbol of worship.

"That is the end of our conversation.
The only ones qualified to obtain the Holy Grail are those who have Servants. When there is only one of you left, the Holy Grail should naturally appear in front of you.
Tell me your decision as to if you want to join this battle, the Holy Grail War, now."
The priest requests my final decision.


I'm at a loss for words.
I had no reason to fight until just now.
Now, I have a reason to fight and a will to fight.
But can I really accept that?

"Are you still undecided?
Look, a Master is not something you can be just because you want to. Rin has been training long as a magus, but it was not determined that she would be a Master.
All that could be decided beforehand was whether to prepare for it or not.

Only magi are to be chosen as Masters. If you are a magus, you should have been ready already.
I guess it cannot be helped if you say you are not.
You and your teacher were failures in that case. It is merely annoying for such a magus to be fighting, so get rid of your Command Spell now."

"!"
He doesn't need to ask.
I

1) ...Revoke the Command Spell.
2) ...Fight.
...I can't approve of this.
Such dirty killings are wrong.

"What's wrong? Will you fight or not? State now, Emiya Shirou."
...He doesn't even need to ask me.
I
"I won't fight. I'll abandon my right as a Master."
I look directly at the priest and answer.

"I see. I'm disappointed, but it is the Master's will. Emiya Shirou has abandoned his rights as a Master and withdrawn from the Holy Grail War. Is that acceptable, Rin?"
"...?"
The priest addresses Tohsaka and not me.

Tohsaka answers,"I don't care. If that's Emiya-kun's choice, I can't say anything about it."
"...Hmm. I'll take that sense of guilt as a yield.
"Then let us begin right away, Emiya Shirou. Put out your left arm."

"...Fine, but what are you going to do?"
"It should be quick. I am merely erasing the Command Spell on your arm.
There are two factors causing Masters to be Masters.[l]
One is the contract with the Servant, and the other is the Command Spell on your arm.
You will be freed from the Holy Grail War if you lose both of these."

The priest takes my left arm and,"This will hurt. Try to relax."
With a plunge.
Rips off my arm with his bare hands.

"GII!!!!!?"
My body jerks in pain.
With a sound, someone's fingers enter my arm.

"Guh!?"
It is not an illusion.
If there were an illusion, it was that of my arm being ripped off.
In reality, there isn't a scratch on my arm.
A stranger's fingers move through my flesh.
This is... yes, it's just that the priest's fingers, which are transparent like a ghost, are sinking into my arm.

"Done. The operation was successful."
"...Uh, huh?"
I look at my left arm.
...There are no wounds on my arm and only pain remains.
In exchange for that unpleasantness...
The Command Spell on my hand has changed shape.

"The shape's changed... no, is it that there's fewer strokes on it now...?"
"Yes. There are three strokes for the Command Spell. Kirei took two of those out from you. Like a spiritual doctor who removes the infected part without hurting the body."

"Spiritual doctor...?"
I think that's a special magi who heals the body by treating the spirit.
I hear their magic is a "curse" that can remove the infected part without using a single surgical knife on the body...

"...I'm surprised. Spiritual treatment is an unusual act used in uncivilized areas. It's not something a man of the church should know."
"Don't say that. I was unfit to be a priest the moment I took up magic.
So it should not matter if the kind of magic I know is unfit for a priest. Do not worry about the type.

"It was the only thing I was good at. I learned many magics, but this was the only one that fit me.
My magical aptitude is specialized in "opening wounds", for good or for bad. Thanks to that, I am inferior to even my student over there."

"For good or for bad? Of course it's good.
There aren't many spiritual doctors as good as you in the Association, and there are only a few in the church that can handle spirits as well as you do."

"Who knows. No matter how great this healing method is, the spirit is only a contact treatment relying on the body.
It is nothing close to a miracle that allows connection with the "soul", the proof of existence independent of the body
But anyways, the treatment is complete.
The rest is up to you, Emiya Shirou. Use your last Command Spell to cut the contract between you and your Servant."

"...? Cut the contract with my Servant...?"
"Yes. Request abolition of contract before Saber, who's waiting outside. ...I'm sure she won't accept it, so Kirei left you a Command Spell to force her to agree."

"That is correct. By using up your Command Spell and abolishing the contract with your Servant, you present to the other Masters that you are 'harmless'.
Then you are openly freed. A sane Master would not think of attacking a powerless Master.
By relinquishing a power you have gained by chance, you will regain your peaceful life."

"......"
I will break the contract with Saber by choice.
...That's betraying her.
Even if it was by chance, I called for her and she protected me.

"......"
...Have I made the wrong choice?
I cannot approve of Masters killing each other.
I can't approve of it, but if I can't overlook it either, then

"What are you doing? No incantations are necessary to activate the Command Spell. All you have to do is to put your mind to it and order your Servant.
You can tell her directly or you can just cut the contract here. Choose whichever you like."
"......"
No.
I've made my decision.
I can't take anything back now, and the priest probably wouldn't allow it.

"...I'll go and settle this directly with Saber. Then I won't be a Master, right?"
"Directly with Saber... Emiya-kun, that's..."
"Yes, I guarantee that. Go and inform your Servant of the parting. After that, I shall welcome you into the church as subject to protection."

The priest welcomes me, but I don't know how serious he is.
...Anyways, I have no intention of putting myself in his care.
I will only abandon my right as a Master: I will not ask for his help after that.

"I refuse that. I won't need your help. I'll settle things with Saber and after I use up my Command Spell, I'm going home.
That'll be it. I will never see you again."

"I see. ...Well, certainly, we shall never meet again.
Farewell, Emiya Shirou. It is the path you have chosen yourself. Take pride in it."


He doesn't need to tell me that.
I turn my back on him and leave the church.

...I exit the church.
She is there in the stone-paved plaza, under the tall sky.

"Have you finished your conversation, Master?"
"Yeah, I learned what this Holy Grail War thing is.
...And taking that into consideration, I decided. Saber, I withdraw from being a Master."

Saber's brow does not even twitch.
Her green eyes seem to accept my decision, as if it were natural.

"Does that mean you will be abandoning the contract with me?"
"That's right. I'm not fit to be a Master. ...And you too, Saber. It would be better for you to form a contract with a proper Master, not one like me."

"Yes. If I am after a better winning chance in battle, I should form a contract with another magus. Archer's Master should be able to draw out my full potential."
"...I see. Then I can abandon our contract now, right?
I'll use the Command Spell to cancel the contract, so you will be free."

"Shirou, I will ask you only once.
Will you not change your mind about your intention not to be a Master?"
"I will not change my mind. I have no intention to kill others."
I say so, looking directly at Saber.
...And at that time.
The raincoat Saber is wearing sways.

"Oh"
I blankly stare at the death in front of me.
In the time it takes me to blink, Saber runs towards me,"Huh?"
Sweeps my legs out from under me and knocks me over.

"Ugh!?"
Pain runs through my legs after a moment.
T-There's no blood. I still have my feet.

"Agh..."
I'm relieved that I still have my legs.
...Thank God. She only swept me with a metal rod.
My legs hurt like they're about to tear off, but it's much better than having them cut off

"Shirou. A magus who is no longer a Master will be killed by his Servant. No matter how inexperienced you are as a magus, you have the power to keep me in this world as you have called for me.
...A Servant needs a Master.
If you break your contract, I will kill you and take that body.
Do you still say you will abandon your rights as a Master?"

"......"
I look up at Saber, concentrating my fading consciousness.
There is no enmity or murderous intent in Saber's expression.
As natural as it is to breathe,Saber would kill me without emotion to stay in this world.
But still

"That's right. Even if I were to change my mind, I can't do it. Not because I only have one Command Spell left.
...I refused to fight. I refused to become a Master. ...Having such a person as your Master would only result in defeat."

...No matter how it came about, my mind gave up.
If I have refused battle once, the second time must be the same.
I would lament, every time I face danger, that I should not have entered the battle.
It would be bad for both you and me to make such a person your Master.

"Then you do not mind being killed by me here?
...I cannot be a spirit. If I cannot absorb your soul, your body will face a painful death. You are going to accept that...?"

"...Of course not. I don't like fighting, but I like being killed even less. ...I know it won't help, but I'll resist until the last second and flee."
I gather my courage and glare back at Saber, not allowing myself to be overwhelmed by her.

...And then.
"Saber...?"
"I understand. Use your Command Spell, Shirou. It is your decision. I have no right to intervene."
"Huh?"

"Do not worry. It is just the case that I could not establish trust with my Master this time. If you abolish the contract with your Command Spell, I will be free. ...I should only be able to maintain this body for about two hours, but I will just find a new Master in that time."

Saber says so plainly.
Spurred by those words,I pray to the Command Spell on my left hand to abolish the contract.

"You are now free. It was only a short union, but your magical energy was pleasant.
...I shall not see you again, but I shall pray that you safely survive this battle."

The silver armor recedes.
"!"
Without realizing, I almost try to call after her, but I stop myself before I do such a stupid thing.

I am not permitted to call out her name.
...She did not blame me for selfishly abandoning the contract, and she cared for my safety to the end.
Since I have rejected her and backed out of the Holy Grail War, I cannot call out and stop her

It is a silent night.
Even though it's past midnight, the town is too silent.
"......"
To be honest, it's eerie.
I don't think I'm exaggerating. I think that word is very suitable for this atmosphere.

"Man. I wonder when it started to be like this?"
It's obvious.
The Holy Grail War. The secret battle between the six magi is stealing the life out of this town.

"...!"
My chest starts to hurt.
The chest that was stabbed by Lancer only a few hours ago is aching.

"Let's go home. What good will it do to go back to the church now?"
Enduring the pain in my chest, I head home.
I'll think about what I should do once I'm home.
I should be able to calm down if I go home, take a bath, and relax a bit

But.
I'll think about what I should do when I get home.
That thought itself was a mistake.

"Huh?"
Like a bad dream, it tells me that there is no road ahead of me.

"I see. You're alone now, Onii-chan."
I raise my head at the girl's voice.
Under the blue moon.
On top of the hill that should lead me back home,are a girl and a strange figure.

"Gi"
And they burst.
I didn't even have a chance to see it, scream, nor turn and run.

The black giant  standing there swings his weapon upwards, and just the sheer force of the weapon moving causes my arm to
"AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!?"

"AH, AHHHHHHHH, AH, AH!"
It flew off. It flew off. One of my arms flew off.
It flew off from my shoulder and blood is spilling out like crazy and the road behind me is red like red paint's smeared on it... and bones, bones are sticking out of my shoulder, and...

"Berserker, I don't feel like playing chase, so just squash him."
"Gu, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...!!!!"
I roll.
Both of my legs are bent as if sitting Japanese-style.
But they are both bending the wrong way, with my feet bending forward from my knees down.

"Ha... a, ah...!?"
My thoughts cannot catch up to the events.
My thoughts cannot catch up to the events due to the pain.
Berserker.
I definitely heard that.
Then, the monster in front of me

"Heehee, you're well-mannered, Onii-chan. I know that, it's that thing called assisted suicide, right? My grandfather said that Japanese people are a neck-cutting tribe who die by having their necks cut off while sitting Japanese-style."
I begin to pass out.
The girl's innocent voice doesn't match this situation.

"Ah, don..."
I look up.
I can't breathe.
My lung. One of my lungs has been blown about fifty meters behind me.

I fall onto the ground on my back.
Both my legs have become like caterpillars. And they're broken, so they can't move.
So I use my remaining left arm to drag myself away,
"Oh, you can still move? But I'm so sorry. You can't run away now. And besides, it's useless even if you do get away.
Because even if you do, that body of yours will die in a matter of seconds."

"Ha"
My body feels light.
I've lost over half my blood already.
It's amazing I'm still conscious.
My brain is starved of oxygen, and it should have stopped already-

"But you can be relieved. It's no fun if you die that easily, right? So I gave you a small hand!
Onii-chan will stay conscious no matter how much it hurts or how much of you gets destroyed until I crush your head.
Soeven if I do this, you'll be able to writhe like a living thing."

"GI, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I'm crushed.
By that shockwave of his weapon like a printing press, my lower half is crushed from the waist down.
Things that used to be my legs and meat and bones are beautifully turned into two-dimensional objects.

"AH, AHHH, AHHHHhHHHHH...!"
I can't die.
There is only blood left in my head and my body does not function, and my nerves are wanting to die and escape the pain, but my consciousness will not go away.

"Phew, pheew, pheeeeeew...!"
My throat sounds like a flute.
It echoes inside my skull.
My thoughts are still confused.
But wanting to escape this pain,"Ahyou're wrong. I'm not... a Master... any... more."
I tell the girl, as if asking for help.

...An instant of hope.
The girl gasps as if being surprised,"Yes, so what?"
She says with an angelic smile.

"Ahha."
My senses freeze.
I will not be saved no matter what.
I fully understand that I will be killed here.

"Hm, maybe you're small enough for me to pick up now.
Then I'll invite you to my castle, Onii-chan.
There are lots of tools once we get there, so let's continue this there."


My senses will not die no matter how much I am hurt.
They will not die, so rationality freezes.
I don't know how much longer the head will last,But at this moment, Emiya Shirou gives up all hope.
As soon as I leave, the pressure on my shoulders lifts.
Certainly, you could say that getting away from that priest helped.
But Tohsaka standing out in her uniform...
...And the blond-haired girl in a raincoat standing near her make a strangely well-matched sight that somehow takes the pressure off me.


Saber is silent as always.
She's looking at me, so it seems she is interested in the decision I made.

"Let's go. We're going the same way until we get back to town."
Saying that, Tohsaka starts walking.
Following after her, we leave the church as well.

The three of us descend the hill together.
We didn't talk much on the way here, but there's even less talk now.
Even dull as I am, I know why.
After what happened at the church, I truly became a Master.
And that must be the reason Tohsaka is walking a little apart from us.


I understand that.
I understand, but I don't like thinking about Tohsaka like that.

"Tohsaka. Is your Servant okay?"
"Huh...?"
"Oh yeah. Archer is okay. ...Though it doesn't seem like the damage caused by your Saber will heal fast, so I don't think I'll be able to materialize him for a while."
"Then he's not with you right now?"

"No, he's taking shelter at my house right now. He'll be at a disadvantage if he was attacked by other Servants right now, so I'm making him stay ready at a place of strength."

I see.
Unlike my house, I'll bet Tohsaka's house is well prepared against outside attacks.

A house is like a fortress for a magus. They will not lose as long as they stay there.
That must mean enemies will not attack you as long as you stay on your home ground.
...I see.
The boundary field at my house is merely an alarm against intruders, but even having that makes a big difference.

"Oh yeah, Tohsaka. That guy said he was the supervisor of the Holy Grail War, but does he know your Servant?"
"He shouldn't. I haven't told him."

"I see. You guys seem to have a good relationship, so I thought so."
"...Hey Emiya-kun. I'll warn you now. Don't tell anybody your Servant's identity. Keep it a secret even from people you trust or you'll end up exiting this battle early."

"...? What do you mean Saber's identity?"
"What I mean is, which hero the Servant is.
No matter how strong someone may be, if you reveal your potential, you'll surely be beaten someday. ...It's fine, so have Saber tell you her real name later on.
You should understand what I mean then. ...Though, hang on. You're like this, so it might be better if she didn't tell you."

"Why?"
"Because you can't keep secrets. You'll be able to keep a secret better if you don't know about it."
"...Hey now, what do you think I am? I can take care of myself."

"Really? Then do you have anything you're hiding from me?"
"Huh...? Anything I'm hiding from you, that's..." I say, as my face fires up.
I don't have a guilty conscience, but well, would kind of admiring her count as something I'm hiding from her...?

"See. I don't know what you're hiding, but it's no good if it shows on your face.
You have other good aspects, so don't worry about it."

"...Hmph. Then what about you? If you're hiding it from that priest, does that mean you don't trust him?"

"Kirei? Hardly. I'm not crazy enough to trust him. He's a cheat who transferred from the Church to the Magic Association without quitting the Church. He'd happily sell my information to the other Masters."

...Tohsaka says with annoyance.
It seems she really doesn't trust that priest.
I'm a bit relieved, but still, her words do seem to hold a bit of affection.

And we pass the bridge.
There's no conversation between us now.
The cold winter air and our cold breath.
A faint sound of flowing water and the white streetlamps that light up the bridge.
Small things like that are engraved into my memory.

Oddly, I didn't think about looking at Tohsaka, who's walking next to me.
Right now, it seems walking on a bridge at night together like this is more precious than seeing her face.
Me, Tohsaka, and the girl called Saber I know nothing about.
We three walk together without doing much.

We reach the intersection.
The intersection that leads to our houses, the place where we must part with Tohsaka.

"We'll part here. I've repaid my debt, and it would be troublesome if we stayed together any longer. We should part and become enemies from tomorrow on."
It must be to end the ambiguous position we are in right now.
Tohsaka starts talking and cuts off suddenly.

From that, I realize.
She did not explain the rules to me out of any sense of obligation.
She just supported me, understanding the situation I'm in, and acted fairly.
So things are back to normal once the explanations are over.
I will just be her target as a Master now.

"...Hm?"
But if so, what she just said was strange.
Tohsaka must have meant that it would be difficult to fight if she feels empathy for me.
For Tohsaka, everything that happened tonight must have been unnecessary.
'It would be troublesome if we stay together any longer.'
If she is going to say something like that, she should have left us alone from the beginning.

Tohsaka's smart, so she should know that all too well.
But still, she set aside all thought of loss or gain and helped me out.

So what happened tonight was totally out of good faith.
The Tohsaka in front of me is too different from how she is at school.
Even when I put it nicely, she's sour, cranky, unapproachable, and she's so different that I want to scream out.

Man, it feels almost like a fraud.
...Yet, still...
Tohsaka Rin is just how everyone thought she was.

"I see. Tohsaka, you really are a good person."
"Huh? What are you saying all of a sudden? I won't go easy on you even if you flatter me."
I know that.
She won't go easy on me, and that's why she said it'll be a bother if she feels empathy for me.

"I know. But I don't want to be enemies with you if I can help it. I like people like you."
"Wha"

Tohsaka falls silent for some reason.
I hear Tohsaka's house is in the western-style district in the opposite direction to my place.
Since she's taken care of me until now, I would like to walk her home, but...

"A-Anyway, just run to the church if your Servant ever gets killed. If you do, at least your life will be safe."
"I won't like it, but still, I'll take that advice. It won't happen, though. However I look at it, I'll die before Saber does."

I calmly analyze the situation.
"Phew."
Tohsaka reacts strangely once again.
After letting out a sigh, she glances at Saber.

"All right. I won't give you any more warnings because that'd really be empathy.
Just be careful. Even though Saber is strong, it won't matter if you, her Master, gets killed."
She turns her back and starts walking.


But.
As if she's seen a ghost, her feet stop dead in their tracks.

"Tohsaka?"
The instant I call out to her, my left hand throbs in pain.

"Hey, have you finished talking?"

A young voice echoes through the night.
The voice like a song is unmistakably that of a young girl.
My vision is drawn to the top of the hill.
I don't know when the clouds parted, but a bright moon is now shining in the sky.
There.

A long shadow.
There's a strange shape that shouldn't be here in this pale town of shadow pictures.

"Berserker."
Tohsaka mumbles a word I'm not accustomed to hearing.
I don't even need to ask.
That thing is definitely a Servant.
And at the same timean overwhelming sense of death, exceeding even the one in the fire ten years ago.

"Good evening, Onii-chan. It's the second time we've met like this."
The girl smiles as she says so.
That innocence sends a chill down my spine.


No, spine is an understatement.
Not just my body, but my mind is frozen as well.
That thing is a monster.
I'm not staring at it, but just its presence makes me unable to move.

I understand naturally that I will die in the instant I move even a muscle.
It feels like a knife is pushed right against my naked chest.
...Still, I feel nothing.
Probably because there's too little hope of me getting out of this alive.
All fears and impatience are drowned by hopelessness, so I don't feel a thing.

"Crap. He's totally on a completely different level."
Unlike me who's paralyzed, Tohsaka has the composure to stand ready.
...But it'll come to nothing.
Even though I can only see her back, I can sense the despair she's feeling.
"Huh? Oh, your Servant is taking a rest? That's no fun, I thought I'd kill you both at once."
The girl says unhappily, as she looks down at us from the top of the hill.
...We're in an even worse situation now.
That girl knows Tohsaka's Servant is not here.
And then.
The girl lifts the sides of her skirt and bows unsuitably for this situation.
"Nice to meet you, Rin. I am Ilya.
You should work it out if I make that 'Ilyasviel von Einzbern'."
"Einzbern"
Tohsaka's body moves slightly as she seems to recognize that name.
Perhaps she liked Tohsaka's reaction, as the girl smiles happily. And...
"Then I'll kill you. Go ahead, Berserker."
...She orders the strange shape behind her, as if she's singing.
The larger body flies through the air.
The thing called Berserker comes flying down the whole distance from the top of the hill!
"Shirou, stay back...!"
Saber runs. Her raincoat comes off and my vision is blocked for a second.
Saber runs to Berserker's landing point and Berserker lands with a huge thud at exactly at the same moment.
"...!"
The air trembles.
Saber stops Berserker's great sword with her invisible sword.
"!"
Saber makes a pained face.
There,Berserker's gigantic sword flashes like a whirlwind!
A great thunderous roar.
The crash of steel that almost tears the air results in defeat for Saber.
A sliding sound.
Even though she blocked Berserker's giant sword, she is driven back along with the sword she used to block it.
"Guh..."
Saber's posture collapses.
The lead colored Servant chases after her.
The gray figure swings its giant sword as if it's the only thing it knows how to do.
Saber doesn't have the time to dodge it and blocks it with her sword.
It does not matter if Saber's sword is invisible or not.
Each of Berserker's attacks is a fatal one that must be blocked with all her might.
Therefore, Saber has to stay on the defense.
For her, the only chance of victory is to find a means of attack in between Berserker's attacks.
But.
That's only if Berserker leaves an opening.
The black rock sword is just like a storm.
With such a large body.
And with such a large sword, and yet Berserker is moving faster than Saber.
The attacks he sends out are just smashing swings with no technique to them.
But that's enough.
If there is overwhelming power and speed, there is no room for technique.
Techniques are something humans invented to compensate for their weaknesses.
Weaknesses are things that giant doesn't have.
"Run."
I murmur with my frozen body.
That thing cannot be defeated.
Saber will be killed if we go on like this.
So she should run away.
It would be easy for her to get away if it were just her here.
She should know that already...!
"Oh"
That's bad.
My body is numb, but maybe that's why my mind is so calm.
The storm of death that strikes without a pause.
Unable to take all the attacks, Saber retreats, and this time...
The final blow that cannot be blocked is swung.

Saber's body rises.
She manages to defend against Berserker's giant sword, even in a bad posture.

But that's only to avoid a fatal wound.
She couldn't brace herself to totally block the giant sword, and the impact blows her away.

She falls, her body drawing a big arc.
Before she falls on her back, Saber turns in mid-air and lands on her feet.
"...Ugh...!"
She manages to recover.
But red blood is running down her chest.
"That's..."
...How stupid of me.
I was forgetting something important.
I don't know how much a Servant can fight in one day, but this is already her third battle.
And on top of that, Saber has the wound in her chest inflicted by Lancer.
"Uh, gh"
Saber moves as if to protect her chest.
Berserker moves and slashes like a raging wind at the wounded Saber and
Receives many attacks on its back.
"Vier Stil Erschie[szlig]ung...!"
I don't know what kind of magic it is, but Berserker's body explodes from Tohsaka's spell.
Judging from the magical energy given out, the magic directly hitting Berserker must be an impact close to that of a high-caliber pistol.
But even that is meaningless.
It doesn't even scratch Berserker's body.
He isn't nullifying magic like Saber.
It's just that the magic is not doing any damage.
"...!? Gah, what kind of ridiculous body does he have...!?"
But Tohsaka does not stop casting,But Berserker ignores Tohsaka's spells and charges at Saber.
"...!"
Saber raises her head in pain.
She holds her sword up to still fight.
That gets my body to move again.

"No, run, Saber...!"
I yell with all my might.
Hearing that,she faces the enemy she cannot compare to.
There is no end to Berserker's attacks.
Saber's body sinks every time she blocks a blow, and she slowly approaches her final moment.
But still, where in that small frame does she have all that power?
Saber doesn't retreat.
She blocks the surging waves of the giant sword and tries to drive back Berserker with her willpower.
There is no chance of victory.
The way she's holding her ground looks bizarre, as she should know she will be defeated if she keeps fighting.
Maybe it sensed something in her posture.
"[wacky len=12]!"
The figure, silent up to now, roars.
A blow impossible to block.
The blow that even swings through Saber blows her away.
The sound of something falling in the distance.
...Fresh blood spills out.
In that pool of blood, with a body that should not be able to get back up...
"Ag..."
She stands up unconsciously.
...It's as if...
She is saying I would be killed if she didn't do so

That...
Makes me realize how foolish my choice was.
Berserker stops after defeating Saber.
Without paying attention to me or Tohsaka, it waits for its master's orders at the top of the hill.
"Hah, there's no way you would be able to beat him. My Berserker is the greatest hero of Greece."
"...!? Greatest hero of Greece, you must mean"
"Yes. The one standing there is the devil called Hercules.
He is the worst monster there is, on a different level from the heroes you guys can summon."
The girl who called herself Ilya narrows her eyes cheerfully.
Those are eyes of joy, about to finish off her enemies.
I don't even need to say who the ones getting killed are.
Saber will be killed right here.
Then what am I going to do?
Am I going to fight that monster in her place?
I can't do that.
Just approaching that thing without being prepared would stop my heart.
I

1) Run away with Tohsaka...!
2) Save Saber...!
I'll get away from this place.
Saber can't beat that monster.
She will certainly be killed if I let her continue fighting.
If that's the case

"Tohsaka, this way...!"
"...!?"
I take Tohsaka's hand and start running.

If we are that girl's targets, she will definitely come after us.
Then Saber will survive, and we have a chance of surviving too if we run away to a place with more people...!

"Hey, you can't turn your back on him!"
"Huh...?"
The hand I grabbed is shaken off.
And in a flash.
Tohsaka moves between me and "the thing", as if to protect my defenseless back, and...

"Hagg..."
...Has her chest pierced through by the giant's sword.

"Tohsa-"
I can feel my face stiffening as I turn around.
"Guh..."
Tohsaka coughs up blood and looks down at the sword in her chest.

"Manwhat was I doing?"
...Does she mean trying to protect me, or trying to attack Berserker?
Tohsaka tilts her head in wonder, as if she knew it was useless from the start and...
"The church. Go to Kirei."
Leaving those words, she is thrown to the ground.

"Ah.."
My body reacts before I can think.
The black giant standing before me.
Using the opportunity when he threw Tohsaka away,"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
I run desperately, like an animal through rings of fire.

"Oh, he ran away. Heehee, that's cute, Onii-chan. You think you can get away from Berserker?"

I run.
The only thing in my head is Tohsaka's words.
The church. I have to get up this hill and go to the church.
Go to the church and ask for help from Kotomine.
I have to do it.
Or Tohsaka will die.
Or Saber will die too.
Or I won't be able to save them, and I too, will...!

A blow in the back.
Not with the sword.
The giant struck my back with its arm like a bushhammer.

Ah...
"Geez, you're useless...! I told you not to kill him easily, but you can't even do that simple thing...!? You good-for-nothing, I'll kill you to your last one if you disobey my orders again...!"

Ar, gh[r]
"Huh...? He's alive...? He's still alive even though he was thrown all the way over here...?"

I can't breathe. My backbone is smashed, I can't... breathe.
"I see. You're alive, Onii-chan. You can't use any magic, but I guess there was still a reason you were chosen as a Master.
Good. There'd be no point in me coming to Japan if it wasn't like this."

"Uh, "
...I can't move.
You can't call me alive anymore.
I... am...

"No, I won't let you die that easily. I have to hurt you more and teach you how wonderful your life was up until now."

The silver-haired girl holds my head.
Her cold white fingertips freeze my skull.

In that instant, when I am turned into something that is not me,
"Fufu. I'll turn you into an ugly doll that can't even die. Onii-chan is going to take Kiritsugu's place from now on."

I wish with my last thoughts for Tohsaka and Saber to be safe.
Ican't abandon someone who needs help.
Emiya Shirou has chosen to live like that.
And most importantly... I can't leave the girl who fought to protect me.

"All right, Berserker. She will regenerate, so violate her after you chop her head off."
Berserker resumes his action.
I

"Y-Youuuuuuuuuu...!!"
I run with all my strength.
There's no way I can do anything against that monster.
So the least I can do is to push Saber away and save her from Berserker's attack

"Huh?"
I fall.
Why...?
I was going to push Saber away, get Saber away from Berserker, and think about what to do after that, so why...?

"Gaha...."
Why?
Why am I on the ground, unable to breathe?

"...!?"
...I hear shocked voices.
First is from Saber, who is right in front of me.
And Tohsaka is astonished at a distance.
And for some reason, Ilya, who is looking down at me dumbfounded, is also surprised.

"...Hu... h?"
I'm missing my stomach.
I'm on the ground.
On the asphalt are a small amount of blood compared to the wound, soft-looking organs, bones, and many things like that.

"...I see. How stupid of me."
In short, I didn't make it in time.
Yesit was impossible to push Saber out of the way, so I just shielded her.
And my stomach was blown out by that sword.

"Guh."
Geez, I'm ashamed of myself for failing even in a situation like this.
I've been working hard to become a superhero, but I keep making mistakes when it really counts.

"Why?"
The silver-haired girl asks in a daze.

After standing there dumbfolded for a while,"...That's enough. This is boring."
Without finishing off Saber, she calls Berserker back.

"Rin, I'll kill you if I see you again."
The girl leaves.
After watching her leave, my vision cuts out.

My consciousness fades away.
I really can't recover this time.
I was somehow saved when I was killed by Lancer, but that won't happen again.
There's probably no magic that can save a person who has lost most of their stomach.

"...W-What were you thinking!? Don't you know I can't save you again...!?"

I hear an angry voice.
It's probably Tohsaka. She seems really angry, and I'm sorry.

But it can't be helped.
It's not like I can do everything like Tohsaka. All I could use was my body.
...So that's why...
The only thing I could do was to use my body to shield Saber.
I'm in a fire.
Collapsing buildings and burning people.
No matter how far I run, the scenery is always red.
This is a vision of ten years ago.
A memory of the distant past I haven't remembered in a while.
I run through it, as if recreating the scene.

There's no escape even though I know it's a dream.
I run, run, keep running.
In the end, where I end up is how I'm saved after running out of energy.


I wake up with a bad feeling.
A feeling like a metal weight is inside my chest.
I feel my forehead and find that I'm sweating a lot even though it's winter.

"...Oh, it's already this late?"
It's already past six o'clock.
From the kitchen, I can hear the sound of the kitchen knife cutting something.
"Sakura is early as usual."
There's no time to be impressed.
I have to get ready quickly and go help fix breakfast.

"Shirou, what are you gonna do today? Will you be working this afternoon cause it's Saturday?"
"No, I don't have work today. I think I'll be doing something with Issei. Why?"
"Oh, nothing. I just hoped you might come and visit me at the dojo today. I'm in a pinch this month."
"Hm? In a pinch? What is?"

"My wallet. I'd be really happy if someone made me lunch."
"I refuse. It's your own fault, so you should skip a meal once in a while."
"Heh, I'm not expecting anything from Shirou. The only one I'm depending on is Sakura-chan. Right, Sakura-chan?"

"Yes. If you don't mind having the same lunch as me, I can prepare one."
"Yep, fine, fine. Let's eat lunch together today then."

Breakfast continues as usual. Today, along with the usual, there's simmered lotus root with chicken.
I don't think she has to make anything this elaborate for breakfast, but I think she made a lot of it to take for lunch too.
Sakura is a member of the archery club, and Fuji-Nee is in charge of the archery club.
It's natural for them to share lunches.

"Oh yeah, Shirou, you were late this morning. Did something happen?"
Fuji-Nee looks at me, sipping her miso soup.
...Geez. She's usually slow, but she gets sharp only at times like this.

"I had a dream about my past. I just woke up grouchy, that's all."
"I see, nothing unusual. I'm relieved."
Fuji-Nee ends the conversation like she's not interested.
I'm not worried at all about it either, so I shouldn't get mad about it.

Ten years ago.
I used to have nightmares back when I couldn't get the fire out of my mind.
But I saw less of it as time passed, and I'm well over it now that I can let it slide even after dreaming about it.
...But I guess it was pretty bad back then. Since Fuji-Nee has been here since that time, she's sensitive to my change.

"Shirou, are you not hungry? You don't happen to have no appetite this morning, right?"
"I am hungry. I'm fine, so don't try to take my food using my dream as an excuse."
"Man, I'm glad you've gotten so strong, but personally, I wish you were more delicate."

"That's my line. I wish you'd be more sweet."
We make fun of each other without looking at each other.
That proves my liveliness, and Fuji-Nee laughs with relief.

"...Heh."
To be honest, I'm glad she's worrying.
But she'll be elated if I thank her, so I act like I'm discontented.
"Hm?"
Not knowing the circumstances, Sakura looks puzzled at the way we're acting.
After Fuji-Nee leaves, we lock the house and leave.

"Senpai, I won't be able to come and help out from tonight until Monday. Is that all right?"
"Hm? That's all right. It's the weekend anyways. You should be hanging out with your friends, so don't worry about it."

"Huh? No, that's not it...! It's not like that. It's just a personal errand, and I'll be attending the club too! S-So you can come to the dojo if anything comes up!
I'm not going off to play because it's the weekend, so please don't misunderstand me."

"...Huh?"
Sakura's acting suspicious, and she looks very tense.
I don't really understand what she wants to say, but I guess she just means she can't come over this weekend.

"Okay. I'll go to the dojo if something comes up."
"Yes, it will make me happy if you do so."
Sakura looks relieved.
And when she looks down, her face suddenly stiffens.

"Senpai, your hand."
"Hm?"
Sakura is staring at my left hand.
Looking down at it, it's bleeding.

"Huh?"
I pull up my sleeve.
There is certainly blood there.

"What's this? Maybe I cut it while fixing something last night."
But it doesn't hurt at all.
There's just a welt on there.
The welt goes straight from my shoulder down to the hand, and it looks kind of like a small snake running from my shoulder to my hand.

"Well, I don't feel any pain, so it should go away quickly. Don't worry, it's nothing."
"...Yes, if you say so."
Perhaps she's feeling bad from seeing the blood, as Sakura looks away and falls silent.
After Fuji-Nee leaves, we lock the house and leave.

"......"
"Sakura? You don't look well. Are you feeling sick again?"

"Huh...? No, I'm fine. How about you, Senpai? You looked awful this morning and, um, your bruise from yesterday might be worse."
Yesterday's bruise...?
Oh, that welt on my left hand.

"No, it didn't get any worse. It's just a welt, so it should heal in no time."
"......"
She must be worried about something as she continues to stare at me.

"Uh.... it's fine. It's nothing, seriously."
"......"
"What? You've been acting awfully strange since yesterday. This is just a welt, right? Or what, did you step on my hand while I was asleep and you feel guilty about it?"

"S-Senpai, I'm not that heavy! I just..."
"Just what?"
"...Um, I just hope I'm wrong."

"...Huh?"
I don't understand her.
Sakura doesn't talk much, but she tends to say important things clearly.
She doesn't usually talk like this.

"...Senpai. I have a favor to ask of you if it's all right."
"Huh? Yeah, if it's something I can do."
"...Yes. I won't be able to come and help you until tomorrow night. Can you try to stay in your house during that time?"

"...? Are you telling me to skip work on Sunday?"
"Yes. I want you to stay in your house as much as possible. Um, I'll come and help once I'm done with my errand."

"I see... well, I guess I can take a rest for a day.
All right then. I'll relax during the weekend. Is that okay, Sakura?"
"Yes, that will help me out a lot."

I guess it's fine to relax once in a while.
I have some extra living expenses from working a lot recently, so I'll clean up all the junk this weekend.
Hello! Is everyone doing fine?
An hour of gaming a day, for all you who died so easily, this is the assistance corner that solves all your problems in a flash, the Tiger Dojo!
So. First of all, I would like to ask what the meaning of this corner is! It totally destroys the mood of the actual story!
Answer, senior student!
Osu! This dojo is the backstage that always saves the dull and stupid Shirou. It can be said that this is the central foundation that supports "Fate" itself.
It would not be an exaggeration to call this the main storyline of "Fate"!
Marvelous! Bravo! Oh bravo!
Yes, well done. I think everyone's starting to realize now, but this dojo is an important part of "Fate".
Everyone, please don't be tricked by those fake heroines that have large parts in the story, and if you see a dangerous choice, please choose it.
Well, as for this Shirou......
Oh man, squashed lower body and only the head left?
Someone who would do such a thing must be brutal and cruel. What do you think about that, student?
No problem! This is a cute and pop genocide of love!
Unsatisfactory!
Owww... I-I made a mistake. This is the result of a weak Onii-chan making this particular heroine angry.
That is exactly right. In other words, broken samurai code, seppuku if you turn your back.
From now on, please choose cowardly choices like this as you'll die a lot.
But since this is supposed to be a Q&A corner, I shall help you with your problem.
Senior student, what is the counter-measure this time?
Osu, go back to the choice and choose the other one.
All right, well done.
Unexpected deaths like this are set up all over the place, so it's standard to save at choices.
Well then, that's it for this time! I shall wait for you at the next practice!
See you!
There's a sound.
It's hard to determine if the sound is someone crying or something being dragged.
The sound is all there is.
There are only decaying things here.
The stone walls are fragile like rotten trees,and the air is sweet like honey.
The living things on the floor are melted like ripe fruit, and even time is rotten and meaningless here.

This space is worn out after a long period of time.
This darkness is the grave of all that were not mourned for, because of the tenacity of a certain bloodline.

"It seems all seven have gathered."

In the center of the decay wiggles the largest decay.
The sound of worms and the smell of rotten meat.
The master of this basement room is rotten but alive, and swarmed by the otherworldly worms.
The worms that crawl up his feet suck on the skin at the ankles and use their suckers to consume the meat and burrow into it.

There aren't merely a hundred or so of these swarming worms.
If a human were swarmed by this black carpet, they would not even last a minute.
A human would have all their meat and bones taken by the worms and would crumble as a boneless skin.

"Not enough. These worms need to be replaced soon."

But the thing does not crumble.
No, the more the worms enter his body through the ankles, the more complete his body becomes.
That thing is not being consumed by the worms.
The worms swarming the room are the ones being eaten.
The amount stored will last a hundred years.
If this is something that eats only worms, it means that much more life is already guaranteed.

"There are still more chances to come. It does not mean this is the last chance. If the conditions aren't perfect, I should restrict myself to just watching, but..."

"Well," says the figure with a smile.
The "place" this time is far from perfect.
The hole is opening less than ten years after the last battle.
The supervisor, the priest, has two Servants, and the Servant residing at the Ryudou Temple has summoned a Servant herself.
The conditions are not good.
The grail that would be filled in such an unstable battle would be far from perfect.
Even if the gate is opened, it would not be possible to reach inside it.

"Then I should just restrict myself to observing, but unfortunately, the pieces I have are well-suited."

The condition to fight for the Holy Grail is terrible.
But one thingthat "thing" created after a lot of work has been completed perfectly.
It shall reach it once it is open.
It shall definitely reach the Holy Grail if it makes no mistake in the procedure.
After all, it has had the content of the Holy Grail planted within it.
It is a cellular tool that has been contaminated by the Holy Grail for the past ten years.
So as things with the same origin, it is only natural they will attract each other.

"...Heh, there is a next time for me, but that thing won't last long. I received it as an afterbirth, but I never thought it would turn out this well."

That thing prepared as an experiment is so suitable you could call it perfect.
It was planned to be disposable, but if it can be used, it should be.
Either way, it is something that was planned to be disposed of.
Even if it is destroyed in battle, it does not change the fact that it will be disposed.

"Then, there is only one problem.
      How I will motivate it."

The prepared "compatible work" hates conflict.
It would be simple if its mind could be taken over, but the work's mental barrier is stronger than expected.
Well, one with a strong Magic Circuit was what was wished for.
So it is only natural for it to be strong against a poison that tries to violate the self.
Should it be the obedient doll or the superior pupil?
As long as the latter is decided, controlling it is out of the question.

"Once is fine. If there is a small opening, it will seek the Holy Grail on its own, but..."

Creating that small opening is the hard part.
It does not have a mentality that will break down under external pressure.
If it did, it would have broken already eleven years ago.
That thing is the strongest fortress that has no blade to strike back.
Then, what will break it must come from within.
Its emotions will become the key to change it.

"You're here. Then I shall create that small opening."

Footsteps echo through the darkness.
The appearing person walks to the worms in the middle of the decay, and...
"Do I have to kill every Master?"[r]
And asks the anticipated question.



Of course, it does not need to answer such a question.
All Masters must be killed.
We must take away all Servants.
That is the idea swirling in this basement.
But pushing that aside...

"If you say so, it cannot be helped. Then I shall restrict myself to observation this time."

The thing says so.
A voice of relief and a relaxed air.
After giving a kind smile that has no intention of fighting,
"But it is a bit annoying if that is the case. Out of all the Masters, the daughter of Tohsaka is pretty well-made. If there is a winner, it will probably be her."

It murmurs disappointedly.
[r]
The slack air returns.
A small changea faint emotion of evil fills the room.
The one that disliked conflict was moved by that one word.
It is built on that small movement.
A small crack.
A small opening that should not be opened, which the thing itself does not notice.

"Kuh."

The rotten meat laughs.
Swarmed by worms and still rotting, it continues to laugh, still holding a human shape.
"Ah... guh."
I wake up.
I feel sick. My whole body is in pain, and I have a sharp headache each time my heart throbs.

"What... happened?"
I can't remember because of the sharp headache.
My body is cold, probably from lying on the floor for a long time.
The only certain thing is my ripped uniform, and my own blood on the floor.

"...!"
I get up with a hazy head.
The spot where I was lying looks like a murder scene.

"...Damn, I really..."
...Had my chest pierced?

"...Hah... guh..."
Bearing the pain, I enter the closest classroom.
Moving to the locker with unsteady steps, I take out a mop and a bucket.

"...Huh... what am I doing...?"
I'm still in a panic.
Why do I still think I have to clean up, when I've just met something totally outrageous and been killed instantly? Am I an idiot?

"...Haa... haa... damn, it won't come off..."
...I wipe the floor with the mop.
With unsteady hands, I manage to get the blood wiped off, and pick up any trash lying around and put it into my pocket.
...Maybe I'm destroying the evidence.
I'm still in a daze, so perhaps that's why I'm doing something so absurd.

"...Ah... haa... haa... haa..."
I put back the mop and bucket, and leave the school like a zombie.
...I get hotter as I walk.
The air is so cold, but it feels like my body is burning.

...When I get home, the day has already changed.
There's no one home.
Neither Fuji-Nee nor Sakura is around now.

"...Ah... haa, haa, haa."
I collapse to the floor.
I lie on the ground and finally calm down.
"......"
I take a deep breath.

When I inhale, my heart cries in pain as if cracking apart.
...No, that's wrong.
It wasn't just cracked.
It had a hole in it, but it healed, and the wound tries to open up again when I inhale.

"...So it's true that I was almost killed."
No, that's wrong too.
I wasn't almost killed... I was actually killed.
But I'm still alive in spite of that, because someone saved me.

"...I wonder who it was. I should at least thank them."
Since the person was there, that person might have something to do with them.
But that makes no difference to the fact that the person saved me. I have to thank them one of these days.

"Ah... guh...!"
The moment I let my guard down, the pain returns.
At the same time, I feel like vomiting.
"Ah... hah, guh...!"
I sit up and resist the sickness.
"...Huh..."
I place my hand on my bare chest where the uniform is ripped.
Even though I was saved, I did have a hole in my chest.
That feeling.
Such an unpleasant feeling, a spearhead entering my body, isn't something I can forget easily.
"...Damn, I'll have nightmares about this for a while."
If I close my eyes, it feels like the lance is still in me.
I shake off that illusion and try to calm down.
"...All right, I'm starting to calm down."
The result of all that training every night.
Just taking a few deep breaths clears my mind, and the heat and nausea vanish from my body.

"So, about those guys..."
A man in blue and a man in red.
They looked human, but I don't think they were.

Were they like ghosts or something?
But I've never heard of ghosts with form, able to associate directly with people.
And they were talking too. If they have their own will, it's hard for me to think of them as ghosts.
...I've heard that the only ghosts with a body are spirits, but aren't they shaped differently from humans...?

"...No, that's not the problem."
There's another fundamental problem.

...Those two who were killing each other.
...The murderous burglar that has appeared in the neighborhood.
...The ongoing ominous events in Fuyuki City.

"......"
All I can tell with such thoughts is that it's way out of my league.

"...If Father was still alive..."
Perhaps because the wound on my chest is so vivid, I complain about things I shouldn't.

"...Idiot. I've already decided to do whatever I can, even when I don't understand."
Complaining comes later.
First, I have to decide whether or not it's my concern.
"...!?"

The bell hung from the ceiling rings.
This is a magus's house, even if only a poor one.
There is a boundary field that alerts me when a stranger enters the property.

"A burglar, at a time like this...?"
As I speak, I realize my foolishness.
That can't be it.

With this timing, right after that strange incident, that can't be it.
There's an intruder.
Not a burglar, but an assassin who's here for my life.
Because I remember that guy saying...
'You saw us, so die.'

"......"
The house is filled with silence.
In the silent darkness, the murderous intent I felt at school is slowly drawing closer.

"...!!"
My throat gulps.
I feel a sharp chill running down my spine.
I will be instantly pierced if I move from this room.

"...!!"
I frantically contain the scream about to escape my mouth.
The instant I release it, the assassin will happily jump in and take the opportunity to kill me.

...If that happens, it will be just like before.
Unprepared, I will be pierced by that lance again.

"...Ah... haa, ah..."
The moment I think about it, my breathing goes wild.
Damn it.
I'm ashamed that I'm about to give up my saved life so easily and that I'm afraid.

"Guh."
Gritting my teeth and holding my chest, I try to restrain myself.

I should get used to it.
This is the second time.
This is the second time I'm about to be killed.
That alone is enough to make me want it to end differently from last time. Besides, I'm a magus.
What have I been learning for the past eight years, if I can't even protect my own life?

"...All right, let's do it."
Enough thinking.
Right now, I just have to counter the intruder.

"...First of all, I need a weapon."
Even though I'm a magus, all I can do is "strengthen" something that could be a weapon.
To fight, I need a weapon.
The shed has lots of things that could become weapons, but it's too far away.
If I'm attacked when I leave the living room, it will just be a repeat of what happened earlier.

...It'll be difficult, but I have to find a weapon here.
Something long and thin would be best. My opponent's weapon is a lance, so something like a knife won't do.
It would be great if there were a wooden sword or something, but of course, there's nothing.
If anything here could be weapon, it's...

"Man... only the poster Fuji-Nee left here..."
I'm disappointed.
But despite that, I'm determined even in this hopeless situation.
Things are already as bad as they can be, so they can't get any worse.
So all I have to do is run forward until I run out of energy.

"Trace, on."
With the words that suggest my reconstruction, I channel magical energy into the 60cm long poster.
I have to turn it into something that can repel that lance, so I need to channel magical energy into every corner and solidify it.

"Basic quality, analyze."
I extend my consciousness.
As if soaking my blood into the poster through my skin, I permeate magical energy into it.

"Basic quality, reinforce."
A sense that I've hit the bottom.
Right before the magical energy overflows from it...
"Trace, off."
I cut off all connection with the poster and shudder at the feeling of success.

The poster is now as hard as metal.
But it is as light as it was before, so I couldn't ask for a better sword.

"I... did it."
How many years has it been since I last succeeded the strengthening magic?
It's kind of ironic. The magic I've never been able to achieve since Kiritsugu died is finally working in this kind of a situation.

"Anyways, now..."
I might be able to do something.
I have some knowledge of how to use a sword.
I hold the poster with both hands and stand up.

I'll die anyway if I stay here, and I don't think I would be able to flee even if I escaped this house.
So all I can do is to run straight to the shed and make a stronger weapon.

"Phew."
Come if you're going to come, it won't be like before. And the instant I think that...
"...!"
My whole spine shivers.

When did he arrive?
Appearing from the ceiling, the guy drops straight at me.

"Wha... huh?"
Silver light descends upon me.
The guy that seems to have come straight through the ceiling descends to pierce my head.
"You...!!"
I frantically escape by rolling forward.

He lands softly while I keep rolling.
But I stop rolling and stand with my freshly-made sword in hand.

"......"
He turns to face me, looking bored.

"...You're causing unnecessary troubles. I was being considerate by killing you before you noticed me."
He raises his lance again, seemingly uninterested.

"......"
I don't know why, but he lacks the spirit he had at the schoolground.
In that case, I might be able to outwit him...!

"...Geez. I never thought I'd kill the same person twice in one day. I guess it just means the human world is always filled with bloodshed."
The man is complaining as if he thinks nothing of me.


I slowly move backwards.
It's about three more meters to the window.
Once out the window, it's about twenty meters to the shed.
Then, I can run off this instant...

"See ya. Don't come back this time, kid."
He says blankly, as if sighing it out.

"Ahhh!?"
Pain assails my right arm.
"...?"
It happened in an instant.
The man's lance is thrust, without time for me to react.

...I would have faced my second death with that blow.
But what prevented it was my newly-made sword.
He must have thought it was just paper.
The lance, thrust as if the poster wasn't there, was deflected by it and only skimmed my right arm.

"...Wow. That's a strange technique you've got there."
The man's expression goes away.
His carelessness disappears, and he's now staring at me with beast-like eyes.

"Agh."
I screwed up. I was just being stupidly optimistic when I thought I could do something.
The thing before me is a monster beyond belief.
Painfully, I realize my foolishness for letting my guard down even slightly against him.

...That's right.
If I'd been really desperate, I should have ran frantically to the window as soon as I miraculously avoided his first attack...!

"I thought you were just a kid, but I see... I do feel some magical energy from you, even though it's weak. That must be why you're alive even after I stabbed you through the heart."
He points his lance at me.

"......"
I won't be able to block it.
I can't possibly block that lightning-fast blow.
If his weapon were a sword, I might have been able to at least prepare for it.
But that's a lance.
A sword follows a line, but a lance has a point.
How am I supposed to block a blow from a point that I can't even see coming?

"Good, it looks like I might be able to have a little fun."
The man's body descends.
In that instant...
His lance is swung, sideways.

I block the lance coming at my face with just my instincts.

"Guh...!?"
"Good boy. Here comes the next one...!"

There's a huge whirlwind.
I don't know how he's moving the lance in this small room, but it makes a beautiful arc and...
"...!!!"
...Comes to attack my body from the other side...!

"Gah...!!?"
My constructed sword, moved to stop it, bends.
Is he using a hammer!?
Damn, this numbness feels like I've broken the bones in my arm!

"Damn, you...!"
"Huh?"
I swing the sword instinctively.
He must take me lightly as he hasn't pulled back his lance, so I flick away the shaft with my sword!

"Guh...!"
The arms that hit it go numb.
The sword bends even more, and the man's lance only moves slightly.

"...You're useless. I gave you a chance, but you didn't do anything worthwhile. Well, I guess it's asking too much to expect a good armed fight from a magus..."

The man was just playing with me.
He let me hit him once, since I blocked him twice.
...But I used up my one and only chance for just a makeshift attack.
That's why he sees no point in fighting me anymore.

"You've let me down. I'll just kill you now, kid."
He readies his lance again.
"Say..."
During that small unnecessary movement...
"...What you want, you idiot!"
Without looking behind me, I jump out the window...!

"Haa, haa, ha..."
I break the window with my back and roll outside.
I roll a few times, get up, and....
"Haa!"
Without a thought, I turn and swing behind me.

"Hmh...!"
The man hesitates a moment, as I deflected his lance thrust.
As I expected.
If I jumped out the window, he would definitely come after me.
And he would kill me even before I could get up.

That's why I expected the fatal blow and swung at it.
It was a bold plan. I would have died if it was a second too late or a second too early. But considering the difference in our skill, I could never have been too early.

So all I had to do was get up as fast as possible and swing at what was coming behind me.
The result was perfect. I won my bet and deflected the man's lance...!

"Ha, ah...!"
I quickly regain my balance.
Now, I have to make it to the shed before he recovers!
"...Fly."

"Huh...?"
The man who supposedly had his lance knocked away comes up to me empty-handed and...
...Spins and executes a roundhouse kick.

"......"
The scenery flies past me.
My battered chest is numb and I cannot breathe.
No, what's more surprising is, I'm flying.
I never in my dreams thought that I would be sent flying by a mere roundhouse ki

"Guh...!"
I fall to the ground from my back.
I hit a wall and come crashing down.

"Guha, ah...!"
I can't breathe.
My vision is blurred.
I manage to stand, supporting myself against the wall of my destination, the shed.

"Haa, haa."
I track the man with my blurry vision.
...I must have been kicked twenty meters.
The man approaches, lance in hand.

"Guh...!"
I'll be killed.
I'll definitely be killed.
The man will be here in a second.
If I don't want to die now, I have to get up and face... him...

"......"
The lance comes out at me.
I can't even turn around fully, and my collapsing body faces the man's lance.

"Damn, if you're a man, keep yourself together...!"
How fortunate.
I got lucky as I couldn't hold myself up and my knees collapsed.
The lance goes over my head and hits the door of the shed, opening it.

"Oh..."
So, this is my last chance.
If I go in the shed, there should be something that I could use as a weapon...

"Guh...!"
I enter the shed on all fours.
There...
"Here, this is it!"
A fatal, inescapable blow is thrust.

"Youuuuuuuu!"
And I block it.
I unroll the poster and make it into a one-time shield.

"Hmm...!?"
A huge impact.
The opened-up poster did block the lance, but it was not strong enough. It's pierced through and transforms back into its original paper.

"Ah, Guh...!"
Hit by the impact of the thrust lance, I'm flung to the wall.

"Agh..."
I fall on my butt and recover myself.
When I raise my head to try to find a weapon...
"Checkmate. That was a pretty surprising move, kid."
The man is pointing the lance at me.


This is it.
The man's lance is pointed directly at my heart.
I know this...
This is the smell of death I felt just a few hours ago.

"...But I don't understand. You're quick-witted, but you suck at magic. It seems like you have talent, but I guess you're just too young."

...I can't hear him.
My mind is focused only on the weapon in front of me.
It's only natural.
Because I'll die when that thing is thrust.
So everything else is gone from my mind. What else can I think about now that things have ended up like this?

"It's unlikely, but maybe you were the seventh one.
Well, this is it for you even if that's the case."
The man's arm moves.
The movement I couldn't even see before looks like it's in slow-motion now.

The running silver light.
The spearhead moves straight for my heart.
It will spill blood in the next second.
I know this feeling.
The feeling of metal running into in me...
The taste of blood coming up my throat...
The sense of the world around me disappearing...
I felt all of it earlier.
...And I have to experience it again? Really?
I don't understand. Why do I have to go through this?

...This is bullshit.
I can't accept this. I can't just die here meaninglessly.
I was saved. I was saved, so I can't die so easily.
I have to live and fulfill my obligations. If I die, I can't do that.

But the lance will pierce me.
The spearhead will cut into my flesh and pierce my heart.


It pisses me off.
It's ridiculous to kill someone that easily.
It's ridiculous for me to die so easily.
Dying twice in one day, that's ridiculous as well.
Damn, everything is so screwed up that I can't contain it all and...

"Damn it, I..."
Won't be killed meaninglessly...
by someone like you!!!!!!!

"Huh?"
Truly, it...
"What...!?"
...It appeared like magic.

In a blinding light, it appears from behind me.
My mind stops.
All I know is that the figure who appeared is a girl.

moment it appears, it repels the lance thrust at my heart and steps up to the enemy without hesitation.
"...Can it be!? The seventh Servant..!?"
The man readies his deflected lance, and the girl swings something she is holding.

Sparks fly twice.
A strong swing.
The man hesitates, receiving a heavy blow from the girl.
"Kuh!"
He must have realized he is at a disadvantage, as he jumps out of the shed with bestial speed.
While keeping her guard up against the man, she quietly turns to me.

The wind is strong today.
The clouds drift and the moon appears for a brief moment.
The silver light that shines into the shed lights up the girl in knightly form.

"......"
I'm speechless.
Not because I'm confused by the sudden turn of events.
I'm at a loss for words because of this girl's overwhelming beauty.


The girl stares at me emotionlessly with her jewel-like eyes.
"I ask of you. Are you my Master?"
She says in a valiant voice.

"Huh... Ma... ster...?"
I only repeat back her words.
I don't know who she is or what she's talking about.
All I know is that this small girl is the same kind of being as the man outside.

"......"
The girl says nothing and just stares at me silently.
How can I put this?
The figure in front of me is so special that I forget the situation, that the man outside could come and attack at any second.

It feels like time has stopped just around me.
The fear of death has disappeared and only the girl fills my vision.

"I, Servant Saber, have come forth in response to your summons.
Please give me an order, Master."
She speaks again.
The instant I hear the words Master and Servant...

"...!!"
A pain shoots through my left hand.
It's like a hot iron has been placed on my hand.

I grab my left hand instinctively.
That must have been the signal, as the girl quietly nods her lovely face.

"From this time forth, my sword shall be with you and your fate shall be with me.
Now, our contract is complete."

"Contract? What are you talking about...!?"
Even I have some knowledge of magic. I understand what that word means.
But the girl doesn't answer me and looks away with the same grace she had when she nodded.

She looks at the door of the shed.
       There stands the man, his lance ready in his hand.
...Easily slashes the man in red.
Saber raises her arm to finish him off.
But right before the man in red's neck is slashed, he disappears as a powerful magic is cast.

Saber doesn't stop.
She dashes to the person behind the man in red and easily cuts off the large spell the person launches.

"What the..."
I knew she was strong, but this is overwhelming.
That spell right now was at a level of intervention magic that I cannot even compare with.

Father could use one as strong as that, but to cast a natural intervention of that power instantly... I don't think even a first-class magus could do so.
But Saber nullified even that master-class magic.

The enemy must be a magus, as the match is decided right there.
The magus's attacks are no use against Saber, and she mercilessly attacks the magus.

A sound of someone falling backwards.
The magus has miraculously dodged Saber's blow, but the enemy now cannot move.
Saber corners the enemy and points her invisible sword.

"......"
My mind freezes.
Probably because the moon lights up the scene for an instant.
I can tell that the figure Saber is pointing at is human.
I can't tell who it is, but the image of Saber killing someone and getting splattered with blood pops into my head.

"......"
Saber moves...
She will pierce the enemy's throat with the "thing" in her hand.

"STOP, SABER!!!!!!!"
I scream as loud as I can.
Her sword stops.
Thank God I can't see her sword.
The end of her invisible sword isn't wet with the enemy's blood.

"...Don't. Please don't do it, Saber."
I address her, glaring.
Preparing myself to do my best to stop her.

"Why do you stop me, Shirou? She is Archer's Master. We have to kill her here."
No, Saber has no intention of stopping.
She only stopped because I said so, and she is ready to bring her sword down at any time...!

"I-I'm telling you to wait! You're calling me Master or something, but I don't understand anything at all. If you're going to call me that, I think you should explain things to me first...!"

"......"

Saber doesn't answer.
She only stares at me in silence.

"You're doing this in the wrong order, Saber. I still don't understand who you are. But I'll listen if you talk, so please don't do this."

"......"
Saber is silent.
Still pointing her sword at the fallen enemy, she looks at me discontentedly.

"What do you mean by that?
Are you demanding ideals like not hurting anyone unnecessarily?"

"Huh...?"
Not hurting anyone unnecessarily...?
Well, it is true that we should avoid fights as much as possible, but I'm not so good-natured as to release someone who came to attack me.

"So you are saying... do not take life even if it is that of the enemy, correct? I will not obey such an order. An enemy is someone you must defeat. If you still want me to stop, make me obey with your Command Spell."

"...? I'm talking about you. A girl shouldn't be swinging swords around, all the more so if you're hurt.
...Oh wait, I don't even know if it's a sword or not, huh? Anyway! You're a girl, so you can't do that!"


Saber looks dumbfounded, as if taken aback.

How long were we standing like that?
"...So? When will Saber-san lower her sword?"
The figure on the ground suddenly speaks.

"...!"
Saber suddenly returns to concentrating her attention on her sword.

"Give up. I have no sword to lower in front of an enemy."
"Even if your Master says to lower it?
Wow, so even Saber would betray her Master, huh?"


Saber grits her teeth.
But Saber lowers her sword and relaxes.
Saber's hostility disappears, so she must have put away her sword as well.

"I see. Then I can stand up, right?"
The one on the ground stands up.
She looks shameless, brushing her rear.
...Hey, wait a second.

That sulky person is definitely-WHAAAAAAT...!?

"You, you're Tohsaka...!?"
"Yes. Good evening, Emiya-kun."
Tohsaka Rin replies with a big smile.

"Uh..?"
That gets me.
If she greets me normally like that, everything that happened up to now seems like a dream and... No, my head's about to explode, geez, how easy would things be if it did...!?

"Um, no, well, um... so you were using magic right now, so that means..."
"I'm a magus. Well, we're the same, so it's not something I need to hide."

"Guh..."
When she replies clearly like that, it makes me seem stupid for asking.
"Let's talk inside. You don't know anything, right Emiya-kun?"
So saying, she walks toward the entrance.

"Wait, what are you thinking...!?"
And then...
She turns, and the smile on her face isn't like the previous one.

"Are you stupid? I am thinking about a lot of things. That's why I want to talk to you.
Emiya-kun, it's good to be surprised by sudden turns of events, but it could sometimes cost you your life if you don't just accept it. Incidentally, do you understand that now is one of those times?"
She glares at me.

"...!!"
"It's fine if you understand. So let's go to your place."
Tohsaka goes through the gate.

"...She's really pissed..."
It's only natural.
She had a sword pointed at her until now, and she was almost killed.

"No, but still..."
Is it just my imagination or is she totally unlike how she seems at school?

So, I'm in a strange situation.
In front of me is the school's number one idol whom I admire, Tohsaka Rin.
And following silently behind me is Saber, who calls herself a Servant.

"......"
Oh.
The hallway suddenly feels like a different dimension.

But I can't be a coward forever.
I'm a magus, even if I am just an amateur.
Tohsaka Rin, a magus just like me, is acting so fearlessly, so I have to act firmly too.

...But I can only work out a few things.
First, about Saber, who's following me.
I am sure that she is some kind of a familiar, because she calls me Master and I've made a contract with her.

I hear that a familiar is some kind of an assistant for a magus.
Most magi transfer part of their body into something and summon it as another self.

For the other self, a magus usually uses a small animal.
That's simply because it's easy to take over the mind of something like a cat or a dog.
Some magi use a human as their familiar, but they need enough magical energy to restrain a human at all times if they do such a thing.

But if one constantly uses enough magical energy to control someone, it would take most of the magus' magical energy to sustain the familiar.
But that'd be putting the cart before the horse.
A familiar is something that assists the magus.
To reduce the burden on the magus, it is commonly accepted that small animals are most suitable.
...So I've been taught, but...

"Hm? What is it, Shirou?"
"...No, it's nothing."
...Saber looks human no matter how you look at her. And she is clearly superior to me, her master.
I don't have the magical energy to control such a person, and more than that, I don't have the Magic Circuit to summon a familiar.

"......"
So Saber must be something rather unlike a familiar.
She said she is a Servant.
I don't know what that is, but I think the man called Lancer and the man in red with Tohsaka were the same thing.

Then it must be that Tohsaka is also called a Master.
I just saw her magic skills.
If I am worth half a magus, she is worth about three magi... though of course, there's no point in comparing me to other magi when I can only use the strengthening magic.

Anyway, Tohsaka is an amazing magus.
In any spiritually superior land is a family of magi that looks after that land.
The Emiya family only came to this land in Kiritsugu's generation, so we're just strangers.
That's why I didn't know that Tohsaka was a magus, and I'm sure Tohsaka didn't know that I knew magic.

...There are several magi in this town that I don't know about.
If Lancer is the familiar of another magus in this town, then does it mean that I stuck my head into a conflict between magi?

"Wow, it's pretty big. Japanese-style is unusual for me.
Oh, is that the living room, Emiya-kun?"
Saying so, Tohsaka goes into the living room.
"......"
Let's stop thinking for now.
Let's just listen to Tohsaka's story.

I turn the lights on.
It's already past one in the morning.

"Oh, it's so cold! What's this, the windows are broken?"
"I couldn't help it. I was attacked by this Lancer guy. I was just desperate."
"Oh, I see. Then were you fighting him alone until you summoned Saber?"
"I didn't fight him. He just beat me up."

"Oh, so you don't try to show off, huh? ...I see, I see, you're really just as you appear, Emiya-kun."
Tohsaka walks over to the broken window.

"...?"
Tohsaka takes a piece of the shattered glass, takes a look at it, and...
"Minuten vor Schwei[szlig]en"
She cuts the tip of her finger and puts a drop of her blood onto the glass.

"...!?"
What kind of magic is this?
The shattered glass combines on its own and restores itself in a matter of seconds.

"Tohsaka, that was..."
"It's just a small demonstration. It won't be enough to repay you for saving me, but I have to at least do this much.

...Well, I'm sure you would've fixed it even if I hadn't, but that's just a waste of magical energy, right? All you really have to do is replace the window, but we don't want to talk in this cold, do we?"
She says so as if it's something natural.
But needless to say, her skills are beyond my understanding.

"No, that's amazing, Tohsaka. I can't do that sort of thing, so I'm glad you fixed it."

"Huh? There's no way you can't fix it.
Handling glass is so elementary. Restoring glass that broke a few minutes ago is only like an admission test for any school, right?"

"So that's how it is? I was only taught by my father, so I don't even know the basics or the elementary stuff."
"Huh?"
Tohsaka freezes.
...Dammit. It seems I said something I shouldn't have.

"...Wait. Then you're saying you're just an amateur who can't even run your own workshop?"
"...? I don't have a workshop."
...Well, I do have that shed as my training area, but I think Tohsaka would get mad if I called that my workshop.

"...I think it's impossible, but I'll ask anyway. Could it be that you don't know how to handle the five main elements, or how to make a Pass?"
I honestly admit that I don't know.
"......"
Wow, that's scary.
She's so beautiful usually, so she looks pretty scary now.

"Then what are you, just an amateur?"
"That's not true. I can at least use strengthening magic."
"Strengthening... that's an awfully odd magic. So, you can't do anything other than that?"
Tohsaka glares at me.
"...Well, to be honest, probably not."
Her glare makes my answer vague.

"...Geez. Why did Saber get summoned to a guy like this?"
She sighs.
"Hm."
It makes me mad.
I haven't been playing around. I know I'm an amateur, but I don't think it matters right now.

"Well, I don't care. There's no point in complaining about what's already happened. More importantly, I have to pay back my debt right now."
Tohsaka takes a breath.

"Well, I'll begin.
Emiya-kun, you don't know what kind of situation you're in right now, correct?"
"......"
I nod.

"I thought so. Well, I could tell easily, but I have to confirm, right? It's only putting flab on my mind if I tell someone that already knows about it."
"...?"
I think that was a weird phrase, but I stay quiet as I think she'll beat me up if I make fun of her now.

"To put it bluntly, you have been chosen as a Master.
You have a holy sign on one of your hands, right? On your hand or on your arm. There are personal differences, but there should be three Command Spells engraved. That is the sign of a Master."
"On my hand... oh, this."

"Yes. That is also a spell that rules the Servant, so take care of it. It's called a Command Spell and you can retain control over your Servant as long as you have it."

"...? What do you mean 'as long as I have it'?"
"The Command Spell is an item of unconditional obedience. I think you've already realized that Servants have their own will, but that mark overrules their will and makes them obey your command."

"There's no spell needed to activate it, and it will be activated when you put your mind to using it.
But you'll lose one for every time you use it, so make sure you only use it twice.
If you lose all your Command Spells, you'll be killed, so be careful."

"What... I'll be killed?"
"That's right. It's fundamental in the Holy Grail War for Masters to kill other Masters. And the Master that kills the other six Masters is awarded with the Holy Grail."

"What...?"
H-Hold on.
I don't understand what Tohsaka is talking about at all.
Like the part about Masters killing other Masters.
And the part where the winner gets a Holy Grail... wait, does she mean that Holy Grail...!?

"You still don't understand? To put it simply, you've been dragged into a game.
A survival game between the seven Masters, a game called the Holy Grail War. A battle royale between the Masters that won't end until you kill all other Masters."
Tohsaka Rin states so as if it is the most natural thing in the world.


That phrase swirls in my head.
I have been chosen as a Master.
Tohsaka says she is a Master.
Familiars called the Servants.
And.
A battle to the death between other magi called the Holy Grail War.

"Wait. What is that? What are you talking about all of a sudden?"
"I understand how you feel, but I'm just telling you the truth.
...Besides, you should understand deep down. You should know you're in a situation you can't run away from, having been almost killed by that Servant twice now."


That's...
Certainly, I was almost killed by that Lancer guy, but...

"Oh no, that's wrong. In fact, you weren't almost killed, you were actually killed. I'm surprised you're alive again."

Tohsaka's comment finishes me off.

...That's right.
That guy killed me, and I certainly died.
No excuse nor negotiation was possible. I was just someone who had to be killed.
So...
Even if I do deny this battle to the death that I cannot understand, the others in it will not withdraw.


"Do you get it now? Then I'll go on.
I don't exactly know what the Holy Grail War is.
But I know that every few decades, seven Masters are chosen and given Servants."

"I'm also chosen as a Master. That's why I made a contract with a Servant, and you made a contract with Saber.
Think of the Servant as a familiar, given to you by the Holy Grail to win the Holy Grail War.
And as Masters, we are to work together with our Servant to kill other Masters."

"......"
Tohsaka's description is too brief for me to understand.
But there is one thing I do wonder about.

"...Hold on. You say Saber is a familiar, but I'm not convinced.
Familiars are things like cats and birds, right? Well, I do hear that some use human ghosts, but Saber has a body. Besides, she doesn't look like a familiar."

I glance at Saber.
Saber is quietly listening to our conversation.
...She looks just like a human being.
I don't know her identity, but she's a girl about my age.
Just having a girl like that near me is more than enough, so I don't get it when she tells me that Saber is a familiar... and besides, my heart is pounding right now.

"Familiar, huh...? Well, Servants are in that category, but they are on a different level. Because that girl over there is a Ghost Liner, considered to be the strongest of all familiars."
"Ghost Liner......? Then do you mean she really is a ghost?"

A human ghost that stopped living a long time ago.
The remaining minds of those with strong abilities, who remain in this world even after they die.
But that doesn't make sense.
A ghost doesn't have a body. A ghost can be only hurt by ghosts.
So, as I have a body, a ghost shouldn't be able to kill me.

"A ghost... huh? She's similar, but Saber would kill you if you compared her to one.
Servants are heroes of the past given bodies. Beings surpassing humans, more like spirits."
"Huh? Heroes of the past given bodies?"
"That's right. A legendary hero was pulled from the past or the present or whenever and given a body.

"Well, it's the role of the Master to summon them, and the Holy Grail does the rest.
It's impossible for a magus to give shape to a soul, so we're assisted by a strong Artifact."

"Hold on. So a 'hero of the past' means... what...!?"
I look over at Saber.
Then she's a heroine from the past too?
Well, it's true that nobody would dress like that now, but still...

"That's impossible. I've never heard of any such magic."
"Of course not. This isn't magic. Think of it as a phenomenon created by the Holy Grail. It's impossible to recreate a soul and give it a body without it."
"...Recreation of the soul? Then a Servant isn't a ghost...?"

"No. Haven't you been taught that any humans, animals, or machines that leave any great achievements behind get removed from the ring of reincarnation and sublimate into beings of higher rank?
Heroes are that sort of beings.
To put it simply, they have been worshipped and made into artificial gods."

"'Ghost Magic' such as supplicating ghosts uses heroic spirits to make miracles happen.
But the Servants are familiars of the heroes themselves.
So they accompany you in spirit form, but if need be, you can give them form to make them fight."

"...Hm. So you mean you can give them form or keep them in spirit form?
I don't see your Servant, so he's in spirit form right now?"
"No, he's healing his wounds in the summoning circle at my house right now.
Saber wounded him just now, right? If I hadn't withdrawn him by force, he would have had his head chopped off.

"Look, the only ones who can beat these Servants are other Servants, spirits like them. Well, we can hit them too if they take form, so we might be able to beat them.
But Servants are all strong as monsters, right? So we let monsters deal with monsters. The Master usually supports them from behind."

"...Hm."
Tohsaka's explanation irritates me for some reason.
She calls them monsters. I don't know about the other Servants, but I don't wat her to talk about Saber like that.

"Anyway, someone who becomes a Master must kill all the other Masters using his Servant.
Do you understand it so far?"

"...In words, yes. But I'm not convinced.
To begin with, who started such a thing and why?"

"That's not something I know about, nor should I answer. You should put that kind of question to the one overseeing the Holy Grail War.
The one thing I can tell you is that all you can do now is to fight, and Servants are powerful familiars, so you should use them wisely."

Tohsaka says so, and now turns to Saber.

"So from what I hear from Emiya-kun, you must not be in full form, Saber. You were summoned by an apprentice magus who has no idea how to be a Master."

"...Yes, I am not in full form as you say.
Since Shirou does not have the magical energy to give me form, it will be difficult for me to turn into a spirit or to replenish my magical energy."

"...I'm surprised. I'm surprised that you were in that bad of a state, but I didn't think you'd tell me honestly. I was wondering how I ought to find out your weakness."

"I do not wish to let others know of my weakness, but I do not think I can fool you. It would be meaningless to hide our situation from you.
So it will be better for us to tell you of our situation, and to have Shirou better understand the situation he is in right now."

"Correct. And you have a good personality too. ...Geez, I'm regretting it even more now. If I was your Master, I would have certainly won this war!"
Tohsaka clenches her fists with anger.

"Hmm. Tohsaka, do you mean I'm not fit to be her Master?"
"Of course not, idiot."
Wow. She just said something that any normal person would have trouble saying.

"What? Do you have any more questions?"
And she doesn't realize it.
Her honor student image from school crumbles inside of me.
...Good going, Issei. Tohsaka certainly shows no openings, just like a devil.

"Well. We're done talking, so let's get going."
Tohsaka suddenly says something strange.

"Huh? Go where?"
"We're going to see the guy who knows all about the game you're involved in... the 'Holy Grail War'. You want to know the reasons behind the Holy Grail War, right?"

"Of course. But where is it? It's already late, so..."
"It'll be fine. It's in the neighboring town, so we should be back by dawn if we hurry. And besides, it's Sunday tomorrow, so it should be fine to stay up late."

"No, that's not the problem."
It's just that a lot of things happened today, so I want to have a rest and think about them.

"What, you're not going? ...Well, if you say so. But what about you, Saber?"
Tohsaka asks Saber.
"Hold on, this has nothing to do with Saber. Don't push her."

"Oh, you're already feeling like a Master? You don't want me talking to Saber?"
"T-That's not it! It's just that if what you said is true, then Saber is a heroine from the past, right? So she wouldn't know about this time since she was just summoned.
So..."

"Shirou, that is wrong. Servants can adapt to any time. So I know a lot about this age as well."
"Really?"
"Yes. This is not the first time that I have been summoned in this age."

"Wha...?"
"No way, what are the chances of that...!?"
Hey, Tohsaka is surprised too.
...So that must mean Saber said something incredible.

"Shirou, I agree with her. You lack experience as a Master. As a Servant making a contract with you, I want you to be stronger."
Saber stares at me silently.
...It's a gentle stare that's worried not for herself, but for me.

"...All right. I'll go.
So, where is this place, Tohsaka? It's a place we can come back from, right?"
"Of course. We are heading to Kotomine Church in the neighboring town. That's where the false priest, the one who oversees this battle, is living."

Tohsaka makes an evil smile.
It looks like she's having fun dragging me around while I don't know anything.
"......"
It might be prejudice...
But I'm beginning to feel like there's a problem with her personality....
I won't run away.
Honestly, this Holy Grail War and Master stuff doesn't seem real to me.
But still, if there are only two choices, fighting or running away, I will never run away.
The priest said it too.
If I am a magus, I should be ready.

That is why I must decide.
Even though I'm an amateur, Emiya Shirou is a magus.
If I have decided to become a superhero in the footsteps of Emiya Kiritsugu, whom I've admired all this time

"I will fight as a Master.
If the cause of the fire ten years ago was the Holy Grail War, I can't let it happen again."

As if he likes my answer, the priest smiles with satisfaction.


I take a deep breath.
I have cut away all hesitation.
As a man, I said I will fight.
So from now on, all I have to do is go forward with pride so that I will not go against my word.

"Then I shall approve you as Saber's Master.
In this instant, the Holy Grail War is accepted.
I approve the battle in this town, from now until only one Master remains. Everyone shall follow their pride and compete fully against each other."

The priest's voice echoes heavily through the church.
There is no meaning to that declaration.
Only Tohsaka and I heard the priest's words.
This man merely rang the starting bell as the priest of this church.

"So it's decided. Then I'm going home, but can I ask you a question too?"
"I don't mind. This might be the last time, so I shall answer most questions."

"Then I shall ask. Kirei, you're the one in charge of looking after this, so you should have information on the other Masters. I've followed the Association's rules, so at least tell me what you know."

"That's troubling. I really want to tell you, but I do not know the details either.
Including Emiya Shirou, there are not many legitimate magi this time. There are only two Masters I know about. Three if you include Emiya Shirou."

"Oh, I see. Still, you should know the order they were summoned.
You are the supervisor after all."
"...Hmm. Berserker was first. Caster was second. The rest are pretty much the same. Archer was yesterday, and Saber was summoned a few hours ago."

"I see. Then that means..."
"The Holy Grail War has officially started.
Rin, you are not allowed to come to this church until the Holy Grail War is over. The only time it is permitted is..."

"When I lose my Servant and wish for protection, right? So I pretty much get points deducted if I come here for any other reason."

"That is correct. You may become the victor, but the Church will not ignore the points deducted. They will take the Holy Grail away from you after a boring discussion. That would be the worst case scenario for me."
"You fake priest. A person on the side of the Church supporting the Magic Association?"

"I am serving God. That does not mean I am serving the Church."
"Whatever. That's why you're a fake."

And Tohsaka turns her back to the priest.
After that, she just makes her way to the exit without saying goodbye.

"Hey, is that okay, Tohsaka? He was your fellow pupil, right? So"
Shouldn't there be a more proper farewell?

"I don't care. I rather feel relieved from breaking the ties to him. More importantly, you should leave too. You have no business here now."
Tohsaka walks across the floor without stopping and really leaves.

I sigh and follow her.
And then.
"!"
I feel a presence behind me and turn around.
The priest who was behind me before I knew it, is looking down on me.

"W-What? Do you have anything else to say?"
I back off as I say so.
...Just as I thought, I don't like him.
Maybe we're just incompatible or something, but I can't get myself to like him.

"If you don't have anything to say, I'm going!"
I make my way to the door, trying to escape his stare.

As I go.
"Rejoice, boy. Your wish will finally come true."
The priest says, as if declaring an oracle.

Those words are...
Aren't those the true feelings I haven't yet realized?

"What are you saying, all of a sudden?"
"You should know. Your wish will not come true unless there is a clear evil. Even if it is not something you approve of, a superhero requires a villain to defeat."

"!"
I feel like everything has turned black.
The priest said it.
The greatest wish and the ugliest wish I have are the same.

...Yes, the desire to protect something,...Is, at the same time, none other than the wish for something to violate it.

"Y-You..."
But there's no way I'd wish for something like that.
I don't remember a moment when I've wished for that.
Such an insecure wish...
...Just means the target ideals are inconsistent.
But the priest says as if to pierce my heart, "Good thing you have an enemy now."

"No, you do not have to gloss over it. Your worries are right for a human being."
"!"
I shake off the priest's words and walk to the door.

"Farewell, Emiya Shirou.
This will be my last warning, but take care on your way home.
Your world will change completely from now on.
You are now at the point of kill or be killed. You are now a Master."
Hello! I'm Fujimura Taiga, the instructor of the Tiger Dojo, a dream-like rescue corner that trains people who die easily.
And I'm Ilya, keeping Taiga company out of compassion, even though I don't have to be here.
Daryaaaaaaaa!
Senior student! Your name in this dojo is senior student!
Ouch... throwing me back... the demonic sword, Tora-shinai, is fearsome indeed...
"Tora shinai" has been added to the weapons dictionary.
Huh? Did you hear a weird sound just now?
Nope. Anyways, what is the theme this time, Taiga?
Yes, our topic this time is about the sudden deaths.
It's sudden, but you die easily in "Fate" if you let your guard down.
Everyone basically shows no mercy, so it's proper practice to save every time you reach a choice. Shirou's everyday life is a scramble filled with red lights.
Yeah, Onii-chan is always so unguarded. As I thought, I have to protect him.
Chest.
Ouuuch! Master, that shinai really hurts! Please use a more gentle shinai!
Request denied. A girl like you who kills out of love should run around the dojo three times. At once!
What? I'm against anything tiring.
You don't want this Tiger Stamp!?
Ohh. All right, I'll go.
Well. The cause of your death this time is considering to run away from that very dangerous kid.
It's kill or be killed once you meet her.
Be careful, since a half-hearted choice will bring only death.
Tiger? There's a weird cat near the dojo.
Step on its tail and drive it off.
And don't call me Tiger.
All right. I made it go somewhere.
Very well. Then we are done.
The story is just getting started. Once you get through this trouble, the battle as a Master will finally... start... or maybe it won't start yet...
Which is it?
Hmmm... I guess a bit more training...?

This is a story from a winter five years ago.

It was a night with a beautiful moon.
I wasn't doing anything, just watching the moon with Kiritsugu.
Even though it was winter, the weather wasn't cold.
The corridor was only a little chilly, and it was a good night to enjoy the moon.

Back then, Kiritsugu didn't leave the house much.
Not going outside, he would just laze carelessly around the house.
...I regret it even now, thinking back to it.
Why didn't I notice that it was like the actions of an animal that knows its time of death?

"When I was a child, I wanted to be a superhero."
Suddenly.
That man, himself a superhero in my child's eyes, said that as if yearning for it.

"What? What do you mean by 'wanted'? Did you give up?"
I became angry and asked him.
Kiritsugu laughed apologetically and looked up at the sky.

"Yes, unfortunately. Being a hero is a time-limited thing, and it becomes hard to call yourself that when you grow up. I wish I'd found that out earlier."
I agreed with that.
I didn't know why, but I thought it couldn't be wrong because Kiritsugu said so.

"I see. Then I guess it couldn't be helped."
"Yeah. It really couldn't be helped."
Kiritsugu answers.
So of course, my response was determined.

"Yeah, it can't be helped, so I'll take your place.
It's impossible since you're an adult, but it should be all right for me. Let me take on your dream.

"I'll make it come true."

Before I could finish, my father laughed.
He made a face like he didn't even need to hear the rest.
After breathing in, Emiya Kiritsugu said...
"YeahI'm relieved."
He quietly closed his eyes and his life ended.

Since he looked so peaceful, I thought he would wake up again in the morning, so I didn't disturb him.
Perhaps being used to seeing death factored in too.
Without doing anything, I just looked up at the man who was my father, as he entered a long sleep.

There were no sounds of insects in the garden as it was silent.
In the bright night, I remember only my eyes being hot.
I did not cry out nor did I feel sad.
But I could not stop my tears until the moon sunk.

That is the story from a winter five years ago.
Perhaps I cried ten years worth of tears since after that, there was nothing.

Fuji-Nee's father planned the funeral, and I started living in this house by myself.
Nothing changed even though Kiritsugu was gone.
Emiya Shirou would become a superhero like Emiya Kiritsugu, so there was no time to be playing around.

That's right.
I didn't mention it, but I remember perfectly.
The figure of the man who saved me, who was left to the fire ten years ago.
He held up in his arms an unconscious child, about to die from burns. He became so happy that tears welled up in his eyes, and took the child outside.

From that time, he was the subject of my admiration.
No one saved me.
I couldn't save anyone.
In it all, I was saved, and a person was there to save me.
That's why I decided to become like him.

Become a superhero, so that I could save people and let no one be killed... just like him.
Kiritsugu died peacefully, leaving me his dream of becoming a superhero himself.

It's only natural for a child to succeed their father.
Emiya Shirou must become a superhero and save someone just like the old me.
I swore so as a child.
To fulfill the dream of the man I admired the most.

...But honestly, I don't get it.
What this superhero thing is supposed to be, how to become one, how to make everyone happy like Kiritsugu always said... and I became this thing called a Master and things like the blond-haired girl following me around is confusing my head and really

"......!"
When I open my eyes, I'm in a familiar room.
"What, I'm in my own room?"
As soon as I speak, I start to feel terribly sick.
"...Ugh... it tastes bad... in my mouth..."
I taste blood in my mouth.
Maybe it was filling my mouth, but I breathe in thick air.


I'm not sure why I feel like this.
I feel really sick to my stomach, so I want to go to the bathroom and wash my face.

"All right."
I stand up.
I feel dizzy.
I almost fall and support myself by putting a hand against the wall.
"...Ugh."
The nausea increases when I move.
...No, this is more like pain than nausea.

My body is heavy and it feels like my stomach is turning every time I move. Maybe someone would feel like this if someone poured burning lead into their stomach.
"...Ugh... Imagining that is giving me headaches."
I wipe the sweat off my forehead and wobble out of my room.

"...All right. I feel better now."
I wash my face and wipe the sweat off my body.
"...?"
There are bandages wrapped around my stomach for some reason.
I can't recall anything about them, so I leave them be for now.

"...I'm hungry. I wonder if there are any leftovers..."
Even though my stomach feels terrible, it seems my body wants energy.

"Guh..."
Putting my mind into it, I start to walk along the wall.
I still feel dizzy, and my body feels dull.
"OwOwww"
I walk forward, letting out miserable sounds.
...Really, what did I do before going to bed?
I don't remember any training that could have caused this pain.

I reach the living room.
Sakura and Fuji-Nee must be at school.
There's no breakfast prepared in the living room, and there's none of Fuji-Nee's loudness.
The quiet living room is like a typical Sunday
"Good morning. I'm afraid I came in without asking you, Emiya-kun."
No, it's not.

"Wha!?"
Tohsaka Rin is sitting on a cushion.
Her calmness makes me think I'm the guest in this house and not her.
Yeah, that's why I'm even more surprised.

"......"
I don't know how to answer her, so first of all I sit down.
And then, I take a deep breath and ask,
"Tohsaka, why..."
"Hold on. Could you apologize first? I can't calm down until I hear an apology for last night."
I don't even have time to ask her why she's here.

Tohsaka is glaring at me like she's really mad.
It seems she's really angry about last night, but what happened last night?

"Hold on."
I recall it now.
That's right, why am I so relaxed?
I tried to save Saber and... Berserker blew away my stomach.

"...Ugh."
The nausea returns.
I feel a chill, remembering the feeling of having a hole in my body.
Something in my stomach moves.
It feels really sick.
It feels really sick, but that's definite proof that I'm alive.

Wait, that's weird.
Shouldn't that have been instant death for me?

"That's strange. Why the hell am I alive?"
"Do you remember? The stupid thing you did last night? If you do, then please review your actions."

Tohsaka lets out a humph and criticizes me.
...Huh, that's really annoying.
My head, which was frozen by the fact that Tohsaka is here, finally resumes activity again.

"What are you saying? There was nothing else to do at that time! Oh... well, it does look stupid if you just look at the results, but I was going to do it better.
So it wasn't a mistake."
I protest, glaring at her.

"...Hm."
W-What?
Why is she sighing?

"Didn't I tell you that Servants will disappear if their Master is killed? So it's crazy to try to protect your Servant.

"Look, Saber will disappear if you're killed. If you want to save Saber, think of a way to do so from a safe place.
...Geez, don't you understand that protecting your Servant with your life is just meaningless?"

"It's not that I protected her with my life. I tried to save her, and it just happened to work out like that. I didn't think things would end up like that either."
I did think I would be killed if I went near that monster, but that's a different matter.

"...I see. You seem to be misunderstanding."
As if she's read my mind, she sulks even more.

"Look Emiya-kun. I'll come out and say it, but I didn't take you to the church to help you win.
I was trying to help you stay alive even if you were left on your own. It seems you didn't understand that part of it."

"Help me stay alive...?"
"That's right. You shouldn't take risks if you realize that a loss equals your death. You seem to be someone who would walk out at night by yourself even in a situation like this.
If I threatened you, I thought you wouldn't take risks and you might get through this."

"I see. I didn't notice that."
So that's why she's complaining to me about not realizing that and running at Berserker.

"...? So why are you mad, Tohsaka? It shouldn't bother you if I'm the one that made the mistake."

"Of course it bothers me! You made me worry for a whole night!"

Tohsaka throws out a temper.
...But I see.
I'm honestly happy she's worrying about me.
Looking at the situation, it seems Tohsaka was the one who treated my wound.

"I see. I guess you helped me out. Thank you."
I bow my head to show my thanks and apologize.


"Heh, it's fine if you understand. If you've learned from this, try to act smarter next time."

Tohsaka looks away.
Her gesture is snappy, but it seems she's in a good mood again.

"Then we're done with what happened last night.
I'll go into the main topic, but which do you want to talk about? About last night or about something serious?"

"...?"
Tohsaka starts a conversation as if it's natural to do so.
Her straight-forwardness surprises me, but thinking about it, she's here because she has something to talk about.

If she didn't have business with me, she would have gone home already.
What is it that Tohsaka, my enemy, wants to discuss in her enemy's territory?

I'm interested in that, and I also want to know what happened last night.
It's stupid not to ask, so I

1) Ask about yesterday.
2) Ask about the serious stuff.
3) ...I have a bad feeling about this. I don`t want to hear either.
Even if I'm going to listen to her, I have to know the situation I'm in first.
I have to know where I am before I go somewhere else.
That is the basic principle of a journey.

"I want to know what happened yesterday first."
"That's right. Knowing the current situation comes first. Wow, you're pretty smart."
Tohsaka smiles contently and describes what happened yesterday.

It seems that Berserker left after I fell unconscious.
She tells me that my body started to heal itself, and that it looked fine after about ten minutes.
And she says she brought me here since I didn't regain my consciousness even when my wound had healed, and that's where we are right now.

"The important thing here is that you survived on your own. I did help you, but it was your own power that healed that wound. Don't mistake that part."
"It seems that way from what you told me. So you didn't heal it?"

"Of course not. I can't do anything like revive a dying person any more. Emiya Shirou himself healed his own wounds."

"Hm."
What can I do, now that she said that?
My stomach is certainly healed, but I have doubts about Tohsaka's story.
I can't use healing magic, let alone revival magic.

"Then the cause must be the Servant.
Your Servant must be really powerful, or something went wrong during the summoning. ...Well, I think it's both, but I think some kind of line formed between you two."

"A line? You mean like the karmic line connecting a familiar and a magus?"

"Oh, so you have a working knowledge of familiars?
Then this should be easy to explain. In other words, Emiya-kun and Saber's relationship is not a normal relationship like the one between a normal master and their familiar.

"It looks like Saber has natural healing powers, so some of that may be flowing into you.
Normally, the magus's power flows into the familiar, but in your case, the familiar's power is flowing into you and helping you out."

"...Hmmm. So putting it simply, it's like a river flowing upstream?"
"That's a good way to put it. It is not naturally possible, but I bet Saber's magical energy is so great that it can even change the flow of a river. That's the only reason she is able to go against Berserker with her small size."

"Not naturally possible... then is the relationship between you and Archer that of a normal magus and familiar?"
"Yes. He doesn't listen to much of what I say, but we do still have such a relationship."

"The connection between a Servant and a Master is like that of a gasoline and an engine. We provide the magical energy, and the Servant just uses it.
...Well, I guess there have been some Masters who shared their physical bodies with their Servants to obtain fake immortality. Not dying until their Servants are dead, something like that... Hey, are you listening, Emiya-kun?"

"Huh...? Yeah, I'm listening.
Then, are you saying most wounds on my body will heal even if I don't do anything?"

"Using your Servant's magical energy. I don't know how, but I'm sure the cause is in Saber's materialization. I know you haven't learned the curse of self-healing."
"Of course not. My father never taught me anything that difficult."

"No, I mean that if that's the case, I've nothing to worry about. Don't worry about it, it has nothing to do with you."

"...?"
What is it?
Tohsaka's words are indirect and hard to follow.

"Oh well. Just don't do anything too reckless.
It's good that you survived this time, but you won't survive if you take that kind of wound again. You shouldn't get any optimistic hopes that you'll survive any major wounds."

"I understand. I feel bad about taking damage and having Saber helping me."

"Idiot, that's not the reason. I'm sure you're not just using Saber's magical energy to heal your wounds.
You're definitely using something.
I don't know what it is... your life span, your luck, or your savings account, but you're definitely using something up."
Tohsaka gives a humph once again.
I feel the same way, but...

"Tohsaka, doesn't my savings account have nothing to do with this?"
"Of course it does! Magic uses up your money, so it's something that drains your money the more you use it!
I won't allow myself to be wrong!"
Tohsaka Rin erupts with the fires of personal grudges.

It's strange.
The more I talk with her, the more I understand this is the real Tohsaka Rin, and that the Tohsaka at school is just a mask she puts on.
...No, it's something I had realized already yesterday.

"Well, putting the part about money aside.
I'll be serious, is that all right, Emiya-kun?"
"That's why you stayed here, right? All right, I'll listen."

"Then I'll be direct about it. What are you planning to do from now on?"
She asks directly the one question I don't want to be asked.

...No, that's not it.
It's not that I don't want her to ask me, but I haven't made my mind up yet.
I'm the one who wants to ask, what do I do now.

"...Honestly, I don't know. You say I should fight for the Holy Grail, but I've never been in a fight between magi.
First of all, I"
I want to try to avoid killing people, and most of all

"I'm not interested in something mysterious like the Holy Grail.
I'm not too sure about risking my life for something I don't want."
"I knew you'd say that. You'll be killed by your Servant if you say something like that."

"Wha... Why would I!?"
"Because the Servant's goal is also the Holy Grail.
They can be summoned by the Masters because the condition on their summoning is that they obtain the Holy Grail."

"The most important thing for a Servant is to obtain the Holy Grail.
They obey their Master and risk their life for their Master, because they have a chance of obtaining the Holy Grail.
So just try saying that you don't want the Holy Grail. You can't complain even if they kill you and call you a betrayer."

"...What is that? That's weird, because Servants are what the Master summons, right?
So"

"Do you think a Servant would obey a human for no reward?
The Holy Grail grants the wish of whoever obtains it. The Servant of the Master who obtains it is no exception.
Even the Servants have their own wishes. That is why they respond to the otherwise impossible summoning."

"It's not that the Masters are summoning the Servants to obtain the Holy Grail.
The Servants are answering the Masters' call because they can obtain the Holy Grail."


Servants have their own desires...?
Then, does that mean Saber has a wish she wants the Holy Grail to grant?

"That's why the Servants try to eliminate other Servants even without orders from their Masters. Only one can obtain the Holy Grail. They cannot accept other Masters obtaining the Holy Grail.
Unlike their Masters, they don't have the power to take away the Command Spells. So the only way they can disarm other Masters is to kill them."

"So even if the Master has no intention of fighting, battle is inevitable.
A Master who is attacked by a Servant must fight it off with their own Servant. You heard enough from Kirei to know that this is the nature of the Holy Grail War, right?"

"Yeah, he told me that last night.
But"

That means allowing your Servant to try to kill other Servants.
I thought it would be over if I reached a compromise with other Masters, but if the Servants are ones summoned to obtain the Holy Grail and if it is true that they will not give it up, then a battle between the Servants is inevitable.
...Then...
The girl that fought to protect me is also ready to kill or be killed to obtain the Holy Grail?

"...That's awful. I don't know about this heroic spirit thing, but Saber is human. She was bleeding badly yesterday too."
"Oh, don't worry about that part. There's no life or death for the Servants. Even if Servants are eliminated, they just go back to where they belong. Heroic spirits are a phenomenon. They can't be killed. The only ones that can be killed during a fight are the Masters."

"No, but still..."
Even if it's a temporary death...
There's still the fact that something human-shaped has disappeared from this world.

"What? Are you saying it's murder? Are you still carrying such a sense of justice even though you're a magus?"


Her comment is only natural.
As a magus, death is always right beside me.
I understand it and I'm already prepared for that.
But stillI'm not strong enough to judge people's deaths as good or bad.

"Of course. I won't participate in a fight to the death."
"Oh? So you're just going to wait for the others to kill you? You're ceding the victory to other Masters?"

"That's not it. The point is to survive to the end, right? I don't have any intention of killing others, but I'll have no mercy in a fight to protect myself.
...If the opponent is out to kill me, they won't complain if they are killed in return, right?"

"Oh, so you'll be staying on the defensive. Then you'll just be observing what other Masters are doing, right? So even if someone like yesterday goes around killing everyone, you're going to ignore it?"

Someone like yesterday...?
She must mean that inhuman monster.

Superhuman strength that allows the destruction of a house or two with a single blow...
...Certainly, if that thing wished, this town could be in ruins in just one night.

And on top of that, the problem is that the Servants are normally in spirit form.
Humans can't see those in spirit form.
But since the Servants can affect the real world as spirits, you could call them the most powerful weapon.
With the technology we have now, there are no weapons that can affect a spiritual being.

Our attacks are useless against them, and their attacks can damage us.
It's not just a one-sided game.
Murder by a Servant is like a natural death for normal people.
Death caused by an invisible killer will just be treated as accidental death or suicide.

"What is that? Servantsno, Masters and Servants don't just attack other Masters? Other people have nothing to do with them, right?"
"Yeah, I really wish that was the case. But if it were, you wouldn't need a supervisor like Kirei, would you?"

"I should have said earlier. Servants are spirits. They are already complete, so they don't grow.
But magical energy used as fuel is different.
The more magical energy they have available, the more they can use the powers they had in life.
That part is the same as for us magi... do you understand?"

"I do. So they can use magic repeatedly, right?"

You could say magical energy is the gunpowder to fill a gun, and the magus is the gun itself.
The type of gun depends on the magus's abilities: pistol, rifle, machinegun, shotgun...
Using that metaphor, Servants are cannons.
Using a large amount of gunpowder, they fire a large bullet.

"That's right. Servants aren't given their mana by nature. They act with the magical energy inside them.
We Masters support them, so Servants can only use their powers using their own magical energy plus the magical energy of their Master.

"But that means an amateur Master like you would be no match for other Masters, right?
So there's a loophole... well, I guess you could call it an obvious answer. Servants can supplement their magical energy from other sources.
Servants are spirits, so they can get nourishment from eating things that are like them."

"Hm?"
Nourished by eating things that are like them...?
"Things like them? You mean spirits? But what kind of spirits would they eat?"

"It's a simple answer. Nature spirits obtain power from nature itself.
So where do you think Servants, human spirits, get their power from?"
"Oh."
It is a simple answer.
As we humans eat meat, the human spirits

"Exactly. Usually, they replenish enough magical energy from their Master.
But it's obvious that one gets more magical energy from many people rather than just one person, right?
To put it bluntly, a weak Master makes his Servant eat humans."


"Servants transform human emotions and souls into magical energy.
That is the most efficient way to make your Servant more powerful. There are many Masters who kill humans as sacrifices for their Servant."

"As sacrifices... so you're saying that if a Master didn't care about his methods, he would kill humans to make his Servant stronger?"
"Yes. But I don't think a smart Master would do such a thing."

"You see, even if Servants are powerful, there is a limit to their magical energy capacity. They can't store magical energy over their capacity, so there is a limit to how much they can kill and collect magical energy.
The Association wouldn't ignore you if you went around killing people, and most of all, other Masters might figure out your Servant's abilities and identify them from the cause of death. Not to mention the identity of the Master as well.
It is highly advantageous in the Holy Grail War to keep your identity a secret, so a normal Master should be stingy about using their Servant."

...I see.
Certainly, if nobody knows that you are a Master, there's no danger of other Masters attacking you.
Conversely, if you know who the other Masters are, you could definitely pull a surprise attack on them.
By that theory, there won't be many Masters that would have their Servants attack humans and reveal their identity

"...I'm glad. Then there's no problem. That means Servants won't indiscriminately attack humans without orders from their Master."

"Right. They are heroes, right? Someone who would go out and kill people wouldn't be called a hero in the first placewell, no, I can't really say that for sure.
There are many examples of people becoming heroes just because they were a mass murderer."


Tohsaka makes an ominous comment.
As it seems to be her true feelings rather than just sarcasm, a bit of strain in her personality might be showing.

I'm more interested in why Tohsaka is still here.
"Then I want to hear about the serious matter. I want to know why you stayed here."

"All right. Then I'll ask for your conclusion first."
"...?"
...What is it?
It seemed for a second like Tohsaka was disappointed...

"Then I'll be direct about it. What are you planning to do from now on?"
She asks directly the one question I don't want to be asked.

...No, that's not it.
It's not that I don't want her to ask me, but I haven't made my mind up yet.
I'm the one who wants to ask, what do I do now.

Tohsaka makes an ominous comment.
As it seems to be her true feelings rather than just sarcasm, I guess Tohsaka is a realist.

"Anyways, that's what I wanted to confirm.
Now you know what kind of beings Servants are, right?
Masters aren't the only ones trying to win the Holy Grail War. As you've entered this battle, you have an obligation to command your Servant."


...An obligation to command my Servant.
So I can't allow my own Servant or other Servants to attack innocent people

"So, you understand your situation?
Now, about your body. Do you remember what happened to you after that?"

"No, no memory of anything, I..."
I ran towards Saber and got my stomach blown away by Berserker.
I lost consciousness then, and I don't know anything about last night nor why I'm alive.

"...Heh, that's what I thought. Before I continue, I'll explain what happened."
With an unpleasant sigh, Tohsaka starts to describe what happened yesterday.

It seems that Berserker left after I fell unconscious.
She tells me that my body started to heal itself, and that it looked fine after about ten minutes.
And she says she brought me here, since I didn't regain my consciousness even when my wound had healed, and that's where we are right now.

"The important thing here is that you survived on your own. I did help you, but it was your own power that healed that wound. Don't mistake that part."[l]

"It sounds like a lie...
...Then, you didn't heal it?"

"Of course not. I can't do something like reviving a dying person any more. Emiya Shirou himself healed his own wounds."

"Hm."
What can I do, now that she said that?
My stomach is certainly healed, but I have doubts about Tohsaka's story.
I can't use healing magic, let alone revival magic.

"Then the cause must be the Servant.
Your Servant must be really powerful, or something went wrong during the summoning. ...Well, I think it's both, but I think some kind of line formed between you two."

"I understand. I feel bad about taking damage and having Saber helping me."

"Idiot, that's not the reason. I'm sure you're not just using Saber's magical energy to heal your wounds.

Tohsaka Rin erupts with the fires of personal grudges.

It's strange.
The more I talk with her, the more I understand this is the real Tohsaka Rin, and that the Tohsaka at school is just a mask she puts on.
...No, it's something I had realized already yesterday.
"......"
Hmm... I don't think either of the stories can be good.

"Hm? Why are you silent? It shouldn't take that much thought."
"Shouldn't it? I feel like you'd get mad if I asked you about either one, so I don't want to hear either."
I cross my arms and offer my honest feelings.


Oh.
Crap, it feels like I've just poked a sleeping dragon awake.

"...T-Tohsaka...? You look really dreadful..."
Something like a terrible wrath...?

"Oh? What do you mean by a dreadful face? I'll ask you just in case, but did I look angry to you?"
I-It felt more like dangerous...!

"Um, well... I think I saw a vein in your forehead for a second, though maybe it was my imagination..."
I answer the intense smile in bits and pieces.

"Ohhh. So that's how I looked to you? So you must think I'm angry?"
"Uh... um, are you angry, Tohsaka...?"

"Of course I am!!!!!!!
Out of all things, you don't want to hear either!?
Do you have any idea of the situation you're in, you idiot!?"

Tohsaka roars like a beast.
"Uh, um..."
I want to escape from that coercion, but...

"Don't run! Just sit there, Japanese-style!"
"!"
I automatically straighten my back and sit down.

"Um. Tohsaka, why Japanese-style?"
"It's obvious, right!? So I can dictate to you!
It seems your head's still asleep, so stay like that until you wake up!"

"......"
Tohsaka is seriously angry.
I feel like she's going to bite my head off if I disobey, so I nod.
I'm facing a beast.
I think it's best to play dead in front of a raging beast, or something like that...

"Hmph. First, I'll tellbout the current situation. I'll explain what happened last night."
So, Tohsaka tells me what happened last night.

It seems that Berserker left after I fell unconscious.
She tells me that my body started to heal itself, and that it looked fine after about ten minutes.
And she says she brought me here since I didn't regain my consciousness even when my wound had healed, and that's where we are right now.

"The important thing here is that you survived on your own. I did help you, but it was your own power that healed that wound. Don't mistake that part."
"It seems that way from what you told me. So you didn't heal it?"

"Of course not. I can't do anything like revive a dying person any more. Emiya Shirou himself healed his own wounds."

"Hm."
What can I do, now that she said that?
My stomach is certainly healed, but I have doubts about Tohsaka's story.
I can't use healing magic, let alone revival magic.

"Then the cause must be the Servant.
Your Servant must be really powerful, or something went wrong during the summoning. ...Well, I think it's both, but I think some kind of line formed between you two."

"A line? You mean like the karmic line connecting a familiar and a magus?"

"Oh, so you have a working knowledge of familiars?

"It looks like Saber has natural healing powers, so some of that may be flowing into you.

"...Hmmm. So putting it simply, it's like a river flowing upstream?"
"That's a good way to put it. It is not naturally possible, but I bet Saber's magical energy is so great that it can even change the flow of a river. That's the only reason she is able to go against Berserker with her small size."

"Not naturally possible... then is the relationship between you and Archer that of a normal magus and familiar?"
"Yes. He doesn't listen to much of what I say, but we do still have such a relationship."

"The connection between a Servant and a Master is like that of a gasoline and an engine. We provide the magical energy, and the Servant just uses it.
...Well, I guess there have been some Masters who shared their physical bodies with their Servants to obtain fake immortality. Not dying until their Servants are dead, something like that... Hey, are you listening, Emiya-kun?"

"Huh...? Yeah, I'm listening.
Then, are you saying most of the wounds on my body will heal even if I don't do anything?"

"Using your Servant's magical energy. I don't know how, but I'm sure the cause is in Saber's materialization. I know you haven't learned the curse of self-healing."
"Of course not. My father never taught me anything that difficult."

"No, I mean that if that's the case, I've nothing to worry about. Don't worry about it, it has nothing to do with you."

"...?"
What is it?
Tohsaka's words are indirect and hard to follow.

"Oh well. Just don't do anything too reckless.
It's good that you survived this time, but you won't survive if you take that kind of wound again. You shouldn't get any optimistic hopes that you'll survive any major wounds."

"I understand. I feel bad about taking damage and having Saber helping me."

"Idiot, that's not the reason. I'm sure you're not just using Saber's magical energy to heal your wounds.
You're definitely using something.
I don't know what it is... your life span, your luck, or your savings account, but you're definitely using something up."
Tohsaka gives a humph once again.
I feel the same way, but...

"Tohsaka, doesn't my savings account have nothing to do with this?"
"Of course it does! Magic uses up your money, so it's something that drains your money the more you use it!
I won't allow myself to be wrong!"
Tohsaka Rin erupts with the fires of personal grudges.

It's strange.
The more I talk with her, the more I understand this is the real Tohsaka Rin, and that the Tohsaka at school is just a mask she puts on.
...No, it's something I had realized already yesterday.

"Well, putting the part about money aside.
I'll be serious, is that all right, Emiya-kun?"
"That's why you stayed here, right? All right, I'll listen."

"Then I'll be direct about it. What are you planning to do from now on?"
She asks directly the one question I don't want to be asked.

...No, that's not it.
It's not that I don't want her to ask me, but I haven't made my mind up yet.
I'm the one who wants to ask, what do I do now.

"...Honestly, I don't know. You say I should fight for the Holy Grail, but I've never been in a fight between magi.
First of all, I"
I want to try to avoid killing people, and most of all

"I'm not interested in something mysterious like the Holy Grail.
I'm not too sure about risking my life for something I don't want."
"I knew you'd say that. You'll be killed by your Servant if you say something like that."

"Wha... Why would I!?"
"Because the Servant's goal is also the Holy Grail.
They can be summoned by the Masters because the condition on their summoning is that they obtain the Holy Grail."

"The most important thing for a Servant is to obtain the Holy Grail.
They obey their Master and risk their life for their Master, because they have a chance of obtaining the Holy Grail.
So just try saying that you don't want the Holy Grail. You can't complain even if they kill you and call you a betrayer."

"...What is that? That's weird, because Servants are what the Master summons, right?
So"

"Do you think a Servant would obey a human for no reward?
The Holy Grail grants the wish of whoever obtains it. The Servant of the Master who obtains it is no exception.
Even the Servants have their own wishes. That is why they respond to the otherwise impossible summoning."

"It's not that the Masters are summoning the Servants to obtain the Holy Grail.
The Servants are answering the Masters' call because they can obtain the Holy Grail."


Servants have their own desires...?
Then, does that mean Saber has a wish she wants the Holy Grail to grant?

"That's why the Servants try to eliminate other Servants even without orders from their Masters. Only one can obtain the Holy Grail. They cannot accept other Masters obtaining the Holy Grail.
Unlike their Masters, they don't have the power to take away the Command Spells. So the only way they can disarm other Masters is to kill them."

"So even if the Master has no intention of fighting, battle is inevitable.
A Master who is attacked by a Servant must fight it off with their own Servant. You heard enough from Kirei to know that this is the nature of the Holy Grail War, right?"

"Yeah, he told me that last night.
But"

That means allowing your Servant to try to kill other Servants.
I thought it would be over if I reached a compromise with other Masters, but if the Servants are ones summoned to obtain the Holy Grail and if it is true that they will not give it up, then a battle between the Servants is inevitable.
...Then...
The girl that fought to protect me is also ready to kill or be killed to obtain the Holy Grail?

"...That's awful. I don't know about this heroic spirit thing, but Saber is human. She was bleeding badly yesterday too."
"Oh, don't worry about that part. There's no life or death for the Servants. Even if Servants are eliminated, they just go back to where they belong. Heroic spirits are a phenomenon. They can't be killed. The only ones that can be killed during a fight are the Masters."

"No, but still..."
Even if it's a temporary death...
There's still the fact that something human-shaped has disappeared from this world.

"What? Are you saying it's murder? Are you still carrying such a sense of justice, even though you're a magus?"


Her comment is only natural.
As a magus, death is always right beside me.
I understand it and I'm already prepared for that.
But stillI'm not strong enough to judge people's deaths as good or bad.

"Of course. I won't participate in a fight to the death."
"Oh? So you're just going to wait for the others to kill you? You're ceding the victory to other Masters?"

"That's not it. The point is to survive to the end, right? I don't have any intention of killing others, but I'll have no mercy in a fight to protect myself.
...If the opponent is out to kill me, they won't complain if they are killed in return, right?"

"Oh, so you'll be staying on the defensive. Then you'll just be observing what other Masters are doing, right? So even if someone like yesterday goes around killing everyone, you're going to ignore it?"

Someone like yesterday...?
She must mean that inhuman monster.

Superhuman strength that allows the destruction of a house or two with a single blow...
...Certainly, if that thing wished, this town could be in ruins in just one night.

And on top of that, the problem is that the Servants are normally in spirit form.
Humans can't see those in spirit form.
But since the Servants can affect the real world as spirits, you could call them the most powerful weapon.
With the technology we have now, there are no weapons that can affect a spiritual being.

Our attacks are useless against them, and their attacks can damage us.
It's not just a one-sided game.
Murder by a Servant is like a natural death for normal people.
Death caused by an invisible killer will just be treated as accidental death or suicide.

"What is that? Servantsno, Masters and Servants don't just attack other Masters? Other people have nothing to do with them, right?"
"Yeah, I really wish that was the case. But if it were, you wouldn't need a supervisor like Kirei, would you?"

"I should have said earlier that Servants are spirits. They are already complete, so they don't grow.
But magical energy used as fuel is different.
The more magical energy they have available, the more they can use the powers they had in life.
That part is the same as for us magi... do you understand?"

"I do. So they can use magic repeatedly, right?"

You could say magical energy is the gunpowder to fill a gun, and the magus is the gun itself.
The type of gun depends on the magus's abilities: pistol, rifle, machinegun, shotgun...
Using that metaphor, Servants are cannons.
Using a large amount of gunpowder, they fire a large bullet.

"That's right. Servants aren't given their mana by nature. They act with the magical energy inside them.
We Masters support them, so Servants can only use their powers using their own magical energy plus the magical energy of their Master."

"But that means an amateur Master like you would be no match for other Masters, right?
So there's a loophole. Well, I guess you could call it an obvious answer. Servants can supplement their magical energy with other sources.
Servants are spirits, so they can get nourishment from eating things that are like them."

"Hm?"
Nourished by eating things that are like them...?
"Things like them? You mean spirits? But what kind of spirits would they eat?"

"It's a simple answer. Nature spirits obtain power from nature itself.
So where do you think Servants, human spirits, get their power from?"
"Oh."
It is a simple answer.
As we humans eat meat, the human spirits

"Exactly. Usually, they replenish enough magical energy from their Master.
But it's obvious that one gets more magical energy from many people rather than just one person, right?
To put it bluntly, a weak Master makes his Servant eat humans."


"Servants transform human emotions and souls into magical energy.
That is the most efficient way to make your Servant more powerful. There are many Masters who kill humans as sacrifices for their Servant."

"As sacrifices... so you're saying that if a Master didn't care about his methods, he would kill humans to make his Servant stronger?"
"Yes. But I don't think a smart Master would do such a thing."

"You see, even if Servants are powerful, there is a limit to their magical energy capacity. They can't store magical energy over their capacity, so there is a limit to how much they can kill and collect magical energy.
The Association wouldn't ignore you if you went around killing people, and most of all, other Masters might figure out your Servant's abilities and identify them from the cause of death. Not to mention the identity of the Master as well.
It is highly advantageous in the Holy Grail War to keep your identity a secret, so a normal Master should be stingy about using their Servant."

...I see.
Certainly, if nobody knows that you are a Master, there's no danger of other Masters attacking you.
Conversely, if you know who the other Masters are, you could definitely pull a surprise attack on them.
By that theory, there won't be many Masters that would have their Servants attack humans and reveal their identity

"...I'm glad. Then there's no problem. That means Servants won't indiscriminately attack humans without orders from their Master."

"Right. They are heroes, right? Someone who would go out and kill people wouldn't be called a hero in the first placewell, no, I can't really say that for sure.
There are many examples of people becoming heroes just because they were a mass murderer."


Tohsaka makes an ominous comment.
As it seems to be her true feelings rather than just sarcasm, a bit of strain in her personality might be showing.
"Let's get back to the conversation. So, what are you going to do?
Since you don't want to kill people, you're just going to watch, is that right?"

...I take back what I said.
She really has a bad personality. She's a real bully, putting me on the spot and asking me that with a smile.

"I'll just have to stop them. The Masters will calm down once they lose their Servants, right?"
"Unbelievable. You say you won't go out and kill other Masters, but you also say you'll kill them if they do anything bad.
Emiya-kun, do you realize you're contradicting yourself?"

"Yeah, I know it's selfish, but I can't think of any other choices. I won't change my decision no matter how much you argue against it."

"Hmm. But there's one problem with that. Can I tell you what it is?"
She's plotting something. With that face, she's definitely plotting something.
But as a man, I have to listen.

"O-Okay. What is it?"
"Do you remember the Master yesterday? The girl who was talking about killing you and me."

How can I forget? They attacked us mercilessly.

"That girl will come and kill us. I think you know that too."

I... see.
That girl is a Master too.

Since she knows Tohsaka and I are Masters, she will come and attack us someday.
I don't know if it'll be today or tomorrow, but I do know it's a death sentence.
At least, I know I can't stop such a monster.

"Her Servant, Berserker, is on a different level.
You can't match it, being an inexperienced Master. You say you won't do anything except defend yourself, but you won't even be able to do that."

"Sorry. But you wouldn't be able to beat it either, right?"

"I wouldn't be able to beat it head on. It's the most powerful Servant in hand-to-hand combat. I don't think any previous Servant could match it. Even I wouldn't be able to escape if Berserker attacked me."

"...I feel the same way. I don't think I'll get another chance if it attacks me again."

Unconsciously, I place my hand on my stomach.
The wound on my stomach is healed now.
No, you couldn't call it a wound. It was pretty much instant death.
My nausea returns just at the thought of taking another blow like that.

"That's right. Do you get it? You can't choose to wait until the Holy Grail War is over without doing anything."

"...Yeah, I get it. But what are you trying to say? I don't quite understand.
You're not having fun watching me being condemned to death, right? ...Uh, or are you?"

"I don't have such bad taste.
Geez, don't you get it after I've said so much? In short, I'm asking you if you want to join up with me."

"...?"
Hm? Hmmmm, hm?
Um, if I take that at face value, that's...

"Join up!? You mean, me and Tohsaka!?"
"Yes. My Archer received a fatal wound and is healing right now. It will take a while for him to heal fully, but he should still be about half as useful.
And there are no problems with your Servant, but her Master is dragging her down, so she is half as useful as well. See, it adds up fine."

"Huh. I'm not that bad."
"Even though you've almost died three times from what I know of? I think you're the first person I've ever seen almost die three times in one day."

"Guhbut that's..."
"I'll compensate you for the alliance. I'll forgive you for beating Archer and I'll teach you about being a Master. Oh, and if we have time, I can look at your skills as a magus. How about it?"

...Ugh.
That certainly is an attractive proposal.
As I don't know anything, Tohsaka would be a reliable teacher.

And if I can help it, I don't want to fight against Tohsaka.
Not because she's the girl I admired at school.
In fact, if I didn't know her like this, I wouldn't have felt this much resistance.

...The Tohsaka Rin in front of me is so different from how people describe her as an honor student.
But talking to her, she is just Tohsaka and it seems she's just as she appears.
Wellin other words, I'm saying I find her so much more attractive this way that I'm wondering why I even have to tell myself this

"Emiya-kun? I want to hear your answer."
She urges my response.
I

1) ...All right. Let`s cooperate.
2) ...I`m sorry, but I can`t.
"......"
It should be something I don't even need to think about.
I'm a novice, and Tohsaka is at her full potential as a Master and a magus.
Considering the events yesterday, it'd be smarter to join up with Tohsaka.
But

"Emiya-kun. I want to hear your response."
"......"
I feel like I'm being too hasty joining up with someone right now.
I don't think Tohsaka is out to trick me, but I should figure out the situation first.
Or else, I won't be able to judge what's right and what's wrong.

"I'm sorry, Tohsaka.
I'm glad you're worried about me, but I can't give you the response you want. This is a serious matter, you know? I feel I shouldn't rush to a decision."

I look directly back at her and answer.
Tohsaka narrows her eyes a bit and nods emotionlessly.

"Then the negotiation has failed. ...Well, you have a point too. If you really do want to win, you can't trust anyone."

"That's not it. I trust you, Tohsaka. It's just that I can't decide on my own. If I'm Saber's Master, I can't make a promise without her consent."

"I see. That is true. You are a Master now."

Giving a nod of understanding, Tohsaka turns away.
She leaves, her hair fluttering behind her.

And the girl who could have been my ally turns, and...
"Goodbye. We will be enemies the next time we meet."
...Like the girl Ilya, leaves a cold warning.

"Alright."
I take a quick breath and consider my current situation.
I haven't had time to sit down and think since the incident last nightwhen I saw the battle between Lancer and Archer.

I had my chest pierced by Lancer, returned home after I was somehow saved, I was attacked once again by Lancer, and
"I was saved by Saber and became a Master."
What I heard at the church.
The murderous battle called the Holy Grail War.
The Holy Grail that grants any wish, supposedly given to the winner.

There are many things I don't know about, but I definitely have a guide.
"Yeah, I need to go and talk to Saber first."

I look around the house.
I look around where someone could be, all the guest rooms, but I cannot find Saber.

"That's weird... she's in that outfit, so you'd think it'd be easy to find her."

Even saying that, I can't find Saber anywhere.
It seems Servants can become spirits, but I can't do that.
No, first of all

"Even though they call me a Master, I don't know anything about her."

I don't understand who she is or how she exists.
The only thing I understand is...
No matter how superior their existence may be, they still get hurt in a fight and they bleed if they are wounded.

"Oh."
Saber is in the silent dojo.
Her appearance is different from yesterday's.
Sitting in a Japanese-style on the wooden floor, she is not wearing her armor.
She has changed into refined clothes that suit her well, and is sitting silently.


...I lose my voice at the figure.
With her back straight and sitting Japanese-style with her eyes closed, Saber looks beautiful.
Her state, melting into the silence, reminds me of pure water.


And that removes the last doubts within me.
Even if she is a Servant, I think she is holy.
SoI should not follow a wrong path with her.

"Saber."
I call out.
Saber slowly opens her eyes and returns my gaze.

"You are awake, Shirou."
A calm voice.
Her voice, echoing through the dojo as if permeating it, is surprisingly suited to this place.

"Yeah. I just got up. What were you doing here?"
"I was resting. I cannot treat you, so I thought I would get myself into perfect condition."

"!"
Saber says so while looking at me.
...Well, um...
I feel a tension, different from the one I felt with Tohsaka.

"Shirou? What is it? Could it be that your body is still...?"
"...! N-No, there's no problem...! I'm just perplexed for my own reasons, so don't worry...!"
I take a step back, shaking my head.

"...?"
Looking away from Saber, who is tilting her head questioningly, I calm down my pounding heart.

"...Calm down. What am I so tense about!?"
I take a deep breath.
...But it doesn't seem to die down quickly. In fact, I don't think it ever will.
"...Geez, why has she changed...?"

I complain without meaning to.
Saber's clothes are so real that they make me conscious of her womanhood, whether I like it or not.

...She is terribly beautiful.
I thought I figured that out yesterday, but she really hits me with it now.
If she dresses so much like a girl, as a healthy guy, I'm troubled.

"Shirou."
I tense up the moment our eyes meet.
But I didn't look for her so as to not talk to her. I'm troubled, but I can't stay quiet forever.

"All right.
May I, Saber? It'll be the first time we sit down and talk"
I make up my mind and talk to her.
And then.

"Shirou. Before that, there is something I would like to tell you about last night."
She interrupts my words with a sullenness that makes her earlier calmness seem like an illusion.

"? All right, what is it?"

"It is about last night.
You are my Master. It is troubling if you take such an action. Battle is my work, so you must concentrate on your role. If you go and die in vain yourself, there is no way I can protect you."

Saber says so clearly.
That makes the tension I was feeling vanish.

"W-What do you mean!? You would have been slashed if I didn't do that!"

"In that case, I would have just died. It was not something you should have been hurt for.
I will repeat myself. Please do not take such an action again.
There is no need for my Master to protect me, and there is no reason for it either."

"Whadon't be stupid. You don't need a reason to save a girl...!"

Maybe she was surprised at being yelled at, but she pauses for a moment as if I've done something unexpected.
And then, she stares at me with indescribable dignity.

"Uh..."
I back up a bit being stared at.
Her look makes me realize that I've said something really out-of-place, and it embarrasses me.

"A-Anyway, I'm grateful that you brought me home. I'll thank you for that."

I thank her while looking away.
...It's awkward to thank her in the first place, but it's even more awkward to thank her in this situation.
But still, before anything, I have to thank her for helping me.

"You are welcome. It is natural for a Servant to protect her Master, but I am happy to be thanked. You are very polite."
"No. I'm not polite."

So there's something I need to clarify right now.

"Going back to our conversation, Saber.
...Oh, I'll ask formally. Can I call you Saber?"

"Yes. Since I have formed a contract with you as a Servant, I am your sword. I will follow your orders, defeat your enemies, and protect you."
Saber says so without the slightest hesitation.
There's no room for me to question her about it.

"Become my sword, huh? To win this Holy Grail War?"
"...? Is that not why you have summoned me?"

"No. I only summoned you by chance.
As you know, I'm only an amateur magus. I'm sorry, but I don't have the knowledge nor the power of a Master.
But I've decided to fight, so I'll fight. I'm an unskilled Master, but are you okay with that?"

"Of course. You are my Master, Shirou.
This fact will not change. A Servant does not have the freedom to choose its Master."

...I see.
Then I should try to respond to her to the best of my ability.

"...All right. So you're content that I'm your Master?"

"Yes. But Shirou, I will not allow defeat for my Master.
If you have no chance of victory, I will make one for you. I will use every means possible to have you obtain the Holy Grail.
We Servants do not serve the Masters without compensation. We serve you because we also desire the Holy Grail."

"Huh? Hold on. The Holy Grail, you mean you want it too...!?"

"Of course. After all, the only ones who can touch the Holy Grail in spirit form are we Servants, who are also spirits.
The Master that wins the Holy Grail War will obtain the Holy Grail through the medium of their Servant. After that, the Servant that served the winning Master will have its wish granted in compensation.
That is the relationship between Masters and Servants."


...I see.
Now that she says it, it's obvious something like a "heroic spirit" would never obey a mere human being.
Since they have their own objectives, they serve the Master in exchange.

...Then that means Saber has a wish she wants granted.
That is why Saber has no doubts and declares that she will fight, even with an amateur Master like me.

"...All right. Then can I ask you something else?
A Master is a magus that summons Servants, right?
That's fine, but I don't quite understand you guys. Like, Saber and Lancer, I know those aren't your real names."

"Yes, those are only the names of the classes given to us. ...All right, I shall describe it briefly since we have the chance."

"We Servants are heroic spirits.
We have each won fame during our lives or have accomplished some great deed beyond human ability.
Whatever the means, we are beings that have reached the rank of gods with our own strength."

That doesn't even need to be said.
Heroic spirits are heroes that had supernatural abilities while they were alive, who are worshipped after their deaths, and promoted into the ranks of spirits instead of becoming ghosts.

"But that is also to our disadvantage. As we are heroes, our weaknesses have been recorded.
Revealing our names, revealing our identity, means revealing our weaknesses."

"...I see. Heroes usually do have opponents they are weak against. That's why you're hiding your real name and using the name Saber?"

"Yes. However, I am not called Saber only for that reason.
There are seven Servants called forth by the Holy Grail, and every one of these is selected according to the class."

"Class...? You mean like Saber and Archer?"

"Yes. Summoning a true heroic spirit is already almost a miracle. To summon seven is too much even for the Holy Grail.
As a solution, the Holy Grail prepared seven vessels in advance and only called forth heroic spirits compatible with these vessels.
Those are the seven classes.

Saber.
Lancer.
Archer.
Rider.
Caster.
Assassin.
Berserker.

"The Holy Grail calls forth from all times the heroic spirits, with abilities corresponding to each of these classes.
And those who receive these classes are called Servants."

"...I see. You were a heroic spirit skilled with swords, so you were summoned as Saber?"
"Yes. There are heroic spirits that have multiple attributes, but I believe I am the best when it comes to swords."

"But that is also the weakness of the Saber class.
Since I am not a magus, I can only defeat your enemies as your sword."

"So you're not well-suited to trickery. No, I don't think that's a weakness. You're that powerful, so that should be enough, right?"

"Shirou, you cannot win this war just by being strong in battle.
For instance, if your enemy is stronger than you in combat, what will you do?"

"Huh? Well... if I knew I couldn't beat them in combat, I'd have to do something without fightin"

Having said that much, I understand.
If the enemies are strong, you wouldn't fight a proper battle.
Beating opponents with your sword isn't the only way to fight.
If you can't beat an enemy with your sword, all you have to do is beat them some other way.

"Exactly. If your enemy finds out you are skilled in combat, your enemy will most likely not challenge you in combat. ...And in that sense, Servants that lack ability will use any means possible."

"The Servant Assassin has low attributes, but has a special ability to hide its presence, and the Servant Caster is versed in magic that does not exist in this age.
You cannot be optimistic because of a mere difference in power. And on top of that, we have our 'Noble Phantasms'. No matter what kind of Servant we are, as heroic spirits, we have our guaranteed fatal attack."

"Noble Phantasm?"
That's not a term I've ever heard.
I think I might know what it means from the sound of it, though...

"Noble Phantasms are special weapons carried by Servants.
Weapons like Lancer's lance, Archer's bow, and my sword are such.
Heroes are not called heroes by themselves. Heroes have the weapons that symbolize them that make them a hero."

"The hero and his weapon are one. So those who became heroic spirits each wield a powerful weapon.
That is the 'Noble Phantasm'the trump card for Servants, and the thing we must take the most care of."


...Saber says that Noble Phantasms are weapons that heroes wielded when they were alive.

I recall that blue knight.
The lance that absorbed magical energy from the air and pierced Saber's chest with incredible movements.
That was certainly not something fit for humans.
That lance itself carried a strong curse, but I also felt a strange amount of magical energy in the word Lancer said back then.
Then could it be...?

"Saber. Are Noble Phantasms magics?
Lancer's lance certainly seemed like a lance with history, but the lance itself wasn't extraordinary.
But that lance went beyond the realm of weapons with his words. Isn't that some sort of magic?"

"Yes, Noble Phantasms are certainly similar to magic.
For example, Lancer's lance itself is a Noble Phantasm, but it demonstrates its full potential only when he puts magical energy into it and says its true name."

"A Noble Phantasm could be called a materialized divine mystery.
As spells are necessary to activate magic, recitement of the true name is necessary to awaken and activate the Noble Phantasm.
But there is also a danger in that. By saying the true name of their Noble Phantasm, the identity of the Servant is revealed."

"...Oh yeah. Heroes and their weapons are one. If you know the weapon's name, you naturally know the identity of the owner."
Saber nods silently.

That is why the Noble Phantasm is a trump card.
In exchange for revealing the name, it launches an unavoidable fatal blow.
But when it does not prove fatal... the Servant will expose all its weaknesses.

"Then, Saber. Is your Noble Phantasm that invisible sword?"

"...Yes. But I have not revealed its identity yet. No Servants should know my true name at this point."
Saying that, Saber looks down awkwardly for a second.

"Shirou. I have a request about that matter."
"Huh? What kind of a request?"

"About my real name. Usually, Servants give their true names to their Master only, to determine future plans.
But you are inexperienced as a magus.
A superior magus would be able to read your mind, so"

"Oh, so you can't tell me your real name? ...Yeah, you're right. Like hypnotism, suggestion, or... well, I don't think there'd be any, but if any other Master had mystic eyes, I might just start babbling about it.
All right. Let's do that. I'll rely on you to decide when to use your Noble Phantasm."

"Uhum, can you really decide that so quickly?"
"It wasn't easy. I thought it through.
I agreed after thinking about it, so don't worry."


...Well.
I get most of this stuff, but I still don't have a grasp of the situation.

"Hey Saber, do Servants and Masters have some sort of a mark? I don't really know what I should be doing."

"No. Unfortunately, there is no clear way to distinguish them.
But if other Servants are near, Servants are able to sense them. All the more if they are materialized. Servants themselves are powerful magics.
I am sure you felt Berserker's presence."

"Ughthat could be true. But it's bad to be able to tell only when you're attacked. I need to at least know before they approach, so I can take some sort of countermeasure."

"Then, how about searching for the Master's presence? Masters are magi. Since they use magic for a living, they will leak magical energy. If you search for that, you may be able to determine the Masters in this town."
"...Sorry. Unfortunately, I can't do that sort of thing."

After all, I didn't even realize the real identity of Tohsaka, who goes to the same school as I do.
We were in the same building for two years, and on top of that, I've seen her several times.

"Geez. No wonder people call me an amateur. The only evidence I'm even a Master is this Command Spell. It seems there'll be lots of difficulties ahead."
I sigh.
And then.

"Shirou. Could you close your eyes for a moment?"
Saber speaks with a serious face.
"...? Close my eyes? Why?"
"To prove that you are a Master. Just close your eyes and breathe normally."

"......"
...I close my eyes.
I feel something slightly touching my forehead.
Hey, it's prickling. Could this be the end of her sword!?

"Saber? Hold on, are you doing something weird?"
"...Master, please stay silent and concentrate on my fingertip. If you are a magus, you should be able to feel my magical energy."

"Hm."
I see, so it's Saber's finger that's touching me.
I pull myself together and calm down.

Then.
What is this?

"Saber, what was that?"
"It's not something you should be asking me. You and I are connected by our contract, so its only natural for you to be able to understand my status."

"Understand? You mean, what happened just now?"
"I do not know how you saw it. It is your standard that measures the Servant's ability. Some Masters classify according to color, and some classify according to animals."

"So in other words, you perceive it in a way most comprehensible for you.
This is a standard concept for a Master, so please check frequently. Like me, once you see someone, you shall understand their details."

...I see.
I was a bit surprised since it was so sudden, but I might be able to act a bit like a Master now.

"Master. I have simplified things, but that is all the explanation I can give you."
"Okay. It was quick, but I get it now. Sorry, Saber."

"...You should not be 'sorry.'
If you understand the situation, you should be deciding what to do from now on."

She asks me, leaning forward.
...I see.
Saber is the same type as Tohsaka: attack first.

"Well, we won't be doing anything different.
I don't have the will to go out and beat other Masters like Tohsaka."

"Shirou, that does not make sense. Do you not have the will to obtain the Holy Grail as a Master?"
...Saber narrows her eyes.
They are the calm eyes of a swordsman who allows no disagreement.


I stare back, trying not to lose, and clearly tell her my intentions.

"I do. But that's only because I don't want anyone evil obtaining it. I have no reason to want the Holy Grail for myself."
"!"

"But that doesn't mean I will not fight.
I'm a magus, even if I'm an amateur. I understand I can't back out of this now. I know I can't survive this without doing anything."

"Then you are saying you are fighting not to obtain the Holy Grail, but rather to prevent the conflict resulting from the Holy Grail?"

"...? ...Yeah, I guess you could put it like that. Yeah, I think that's what I mean. I can't put it into clear words, but such a fight is worth something, right?"

That's right.
I don't feel anything toward the Holy Grail.
But for a reason like that, I think I can fight with all my power and with pride.

"...I do not understand. You say that you are a magus. Then you should desire the almighty Holy Grail. Does a magus not master magic because he has a wish he cannot make come true?"

"What are you saying? I have no unfulfillable wishes. I do have lots of things I have to do though."
That's right.
So for now, I should try my hardest not to involve any unnecessary people.

"Then are you saying you do not want the Holy Grail? That you will not fight to obtain it?"
"I didn't say that. Since I'm fighting, I do intend to obtain the Holy Grail."

"That is a contradiction. Why do you desire something that you have no need for, going so far as fighting?"
"...?"
Well, because...
Winning means obtaining the Holy Grail, and most of all...

"You need it, right? So we have to obtain it."


"Yeah, I don't know what kind of people the other Masters are.
Some of them may be really good people.
But I've decided to be your ally. So if you say you want the Holy Grail, it's only natural to help you with all my power, right?"


"...Well, it's only a second-hand ideal from my father, but he said I should be selfish to become a superhero.
It's pointless to support everybody, so he told me to only ally with people I like and trust."

"I never thought that way before, but I think that's how I should be now.
I can't do something like fighting for myself.
But if I can fight for you, then that's good."

And to be honest.
If this girl seriously yearns for it, it's only natural to want to obtain it for her.
...Well, I am a guy, you know.

"Then are you saying you will not fight if I give up the Holy Grail?"
"Hm."
That's a problem.
If Saber says that, all my premises will crumble.

"...No, it would still be the same. I said I'll fight.
So I won't run. This is for certain, Saber."
I declare this, looking her in the eye.
Saber does not answer immediately, but looks up at me after letting out a deep breath.

"I understand. If you say so as a Master, I will only obey. My goal is the Holy Grail, and even if your goal is to stop the conflict, our destinations are the same.
But, Shirou."

Saber stops.
With eyes that seem to be gazing upon something far away,"I cannot clearly put this into words, but you will regret it later on. ...You will surely regret it."
She says those words.
Is it because Tohsaka went home and my tension disappeared?
My body feels dull, so I lay down in the living room.

I stave off the returning nausea by lying on my side.

The clock ticks in the silent living room.
"...A fight between Masters, huh?"
I still don't understand what it is.
The only thing I'm sure of is that it's beyond me.
It would feel more real if I had more interest in the Holy Grail

"Why, I wonder? All I feel toward the Holy Grail is disgust."
A grail said to make wishes come true.
I don't know what kind of a thing it is, but it's an artifact that can even summon these things called Servants.

It might not go as far as granting any wish, but it should have more than enough value for any magus to want it.
But stillI'm not interested in it.
It's true that I'm dubious about its reality, but accepting that easy way to reach a goal feels like cheating myself.

"And the worst aspect of this thing is that the selection method is a battle."
...But this is a fight for a single chair.
No matter what your expectations are, as long as you enter it, you can't survive unless you defeat your enemies.
And depending on your methods, defeating other Masters might result in harm to innocent people.

That's why...
Rejoice, Emiya Shirou.
My reason for fighting is not to win the Holy Grail War.
Your wish will finally come true.
It is to stop those that would try to win it by any means possible.

"!"
I feel dizzy again.
It's only natural.
Even if it appears to be back to normal, my body was almost split in half a few hours ago.
There's no way this sickness will go away quickly. It seems more likely that it'll continue for the rest of my life.

Because I was almost killed three times in a day.
If someone weak joins a battle, it's natural for him to get hurt.
As compensation for my lack of strength, I almost lost my body...
And she was wounded protecting me.

"!"
I get up.

"Oh yeah, her...!"
What am I doing?
I totally forgot about her because Tohsaka was here.
No, I unconsciously avoided thinking about her.
Coward.
I have been avoiding recalling the girl who was wounded because of me.
The one that was bleeding miserably because of me.

"Tohsaka didn't say the most important thing...!"
I pull my resting body together and stand up.
Tohsaka didn't say anything about Saber.
She said she and Saber brought me here, but she said nothing more.
The fact I need to know most: if she, the one wounded by Berserker, is all right or not.

"Guh"
I look through the house, bearing the dizziness.
I look around where someone could be, all the guest rooms, but I cannot find Saber.

"That's weird... she's in that outfit, so you'd think it'd be easy to find her."
There's no sign of the brave armor-clad Saber anywhere around the house.
Tohsaka said Servants can become spirits, but I can't do that.
No, first of all

"They say I'm a Master, but just how am I a Master?"
I don't understand who she is nor how she exists.
This is like a new soldier being given a tank.

"That's right. Even if you give a guy that has only used old guns a brand new weapon, he won't know how to use it."
I complain.
Well, the lucky thing is, this tank has an auto-pilot function. Even if the driver is terrible, the tank will fight on its own.


Angry at my thoughts, I hit my head against the wall.

"...How rotten of me, idiot. That was such an impolite complaint."
I apologize to the blond-haired girl in my head.
Now, I feel like I have to find her and confirm her safety.

"She's not here either"
I search throughout the house.
It's a big house, but I didn't play hide-and-seek here with Fuji-Nee as a kid for nothing. I know the efficient way to search this place.
If I haven't found her after searching this much, then

"The yard, the shed, or"
There are several possibilities, but I don't even consider the possibility that she's not here anymore.
She said she would protect me.
So I don't think she would leave this place.

"Maybe."
It suddenly hits me.
Not the house, the yard, nor the shed where we first met.
Come to think of it, there is another large building in this place.

"She must be there."
I hurry.
I head to the dojo, separated from the main building.


I'm a bit tense.
If she's not here, I will have to admit that she is gone.

"...?"
That makes me realize.
The inconsistency... even though I know nothing about her, I want her to stay.

A wooden-floored room with nothing unnecessary.
A dojo built only to train oneself in.
In this silent place, in the faint sunlight...

She is sitting there naturally.


A space filled with tranquility.
The sunlight shining in is white, and it makes her and the dojo into one.
I can see nothing amiss in her dignified posture.

Just by sitting there, she stiffens the air in the dojo.
But there's nothing cold about it.
It's because her figure is so pure, it makes me forget even about the cold winter air.

", "
Even the sound of my breath is a nuisance.
The girl, sitting Japanese-style in the corner of the dojo, is definitely the girl from last night.

The girl who appeared just before I was killed by Lancer, and the girl that mercilessly slashed him with her sword.
Her golden hair, that was reflecting the blue moonlight, is now one with the warm sunlight.


That really makes me remember.
This is exactly what I felt when I first saw her.
The girl clad in armor, slashing her sword to silently overwhelm her opponent,
I wasn't surprised by how out-of-world that scene was.
It doesn't matter what she's wearing. It probably wouldn't change even if she was covered in mud.
The girl that moved me deeply is still in front of me.


That is why I forget even to breathe and continue to stare at her.
Forgetting about Masters, the Holy Grail War and everything.
In this instantI have completely accepted Saber.

I do not know how long it was.
Saber opens her eyes as if awakening from sleep.
"Oh."
My disappointed voice echoes loudly through the dojo.
Saber stands up, perhaps noticing the sound.

"......"
I walk towards her, still not knowing what to say.

"You are awake, Shirou."
A calm voice.
Her voice, echoing through the dojo as if permeating it, is surprisingly suited to this place.

"YYeah. I just got up."
I answer with a dull head.

"Shirou? You seem pale, are you feeling ill?"
The golden-haired girl approaches me.
"Uh, n-no...! I'm feeling really good...!"
I quickly step back to get away from Saber.

"...?"
Looking away from Saber, who is tilting her head questioningly, I calm down my pounding heart.

"...Calm down. What am I so tense about!?"
I take a deep breath.
...But it doesn't seem to die down quickly. In fact, I don't think it ever will.[l]

"...Geez, why has she changed...?"
I complain without meaning to.
Saber's clothes have changed dramatically since yesterday.
She's wearing normal clothes, completely unlike her armor.
It's rather unexpected and I'm troubled by it.

...She is terribly beautiful.
I thought I figured that out yesterday, but it really hits me now.[l]

Perhaps her armor looked so surreal that I didn't notice yesterday.
But if she dresses like a girl, as a healthy guy, I'm troubled.

"Shirou."
I tense up the moment our eyes meet.
But I didn't look for her so as to not talk to her.
I'm troubled, but I can't stay quiet forever.

"It's Saber, right? This will be the first time we sit down and talk, but"
I make up my mind and talk to her.
And then.

"Shirou. Before that, there is something I would like to tell you about last night."
She interrupts my words with a sullenness that makes her earlier calmness seem like an illusion.

"? All right, what is it?"
"It is about last night.
You are my Master. It is troubling if you take such an action. Battle is my work, so you must concentrate on your role. If you go and die in vain yourself, there is no way I can protect you."

Saber says so clearly.
That makes the tension I was feeling vanish.

"W-What do you mean!? You would have been slashed if I didn't do that!"
"In that case, I would have just died. It was not something you should have been hurt for. I will repeat myself. Please do not take such an action again. There is no need for my Master to protect me, and there is no reason for it either."

She speaks plainly.
It must be because she is speaking so practically.
"Whadon't be stupid. You don't need a reason to save a girl...!"
I reply unconsciously.

Maybe she was surprised at being yelled at, but she pauses for a moment as if I've done something unexpected. And then, she stares at me with indescribable dignity.

"Uh..."
I back up a bit being stared at.
Her look makes me realize that I've said something really out-of-place, and it embarrasses me.
"A-Anyway, I'm grateful that you brought me home. I'll thank you for that."

"You are welcome. It is natural for a Servant to protect her Master, but I am happy to be thanked. You are very polite."
"No. I'm not polite."

More importantly, there's something I need to clarify right now.
It's something I should have asked right after I got home yesterday.
If she is really my Servant,Andif she is really taking part in this war.

"Going back to our conversation, Saber. ...Oh, I'll ask formally, but can I call you Saber?"

"Yes. Since I have formed a contract with you as a Servant, I am your sword. I will follow your orders, defeat your enemies, and protect you."

Saber says so without the slightest hesitation.
There's no room for me to question her about it.

"Become my sword, huh? To win this Holy Grail War?"
"...? Is that not why you have summoned me?"
"No. I summoned you because"

I can't say it was by pure accident.
No, first of all, I didn't even summon her.
She just appeared when I was in danger, and saved me with her own decision.

The result is the situation we are in.
I became Saber's Master, and I was dragged into this thing called the Holy Grail War.
Not one bit of it was my intention.
I'm just an amateur magus that was dragged into this battle beyond my abilities

"! What of it?
...I've already convinced myself that I have to fight. I can't complain now."

I shake my head lightly and stop whining.
That's it.
A man has said he will fight.
So I cannot even talk about running away.
This will be the last time I will talk or think about whining.
No matter how the decision came, I have decided to fight.

"Shirou?"
"Oh, it's nothing.
But Saber, there's only a small chance of winning if you stay with me. I don't have the powers or the brains of Tohsaka, so tomorrow might end up like today. Are you okay with that?"

"Does that mean that you lack the will to fight?"
"I have the will. I just don't have the chance of victory, so I'm asking you if you're all right serving such a Master.
This is a battle I have decided to take on.
So"

I think it's wrong for someone to get hurt in my place.
Even though I'm weak, making Saber fight,And
I can't stand letting a scene like that happen again.

"You are my Master, Shirou. This fact will not change. A Servant does not have the freedom to choose its Master."


That's true.
That's why Saber is my Servant right now.
Then I should try my best not to burden her too much.

"...All right. So you're content I'm your Master?"
"Yes. But Shirou, I will not allow defeat for my Master.
If you have no chance of victory, I will make one for you.
I will use every means possible to have you obtain the Holy Grail. That is why we follow the call of the summoning."

To obtain the Holy Grail, huh?
Tohsaka said Servants also have a wish they want granted.
So Saber must be no exception.
That is why she has no doubts.
But that means...

"...Hold on, Saber.
You said any means possible, right? Does that mean you do not care what measures you take to win the war? For example, attacking people to gain pow"

I cannot finish.
Saber is looking at me like I'm an enemy.

"Shirou, that is not a possibility.
I can only do those things I will allow myself to do. I cannot betray my beliefs. It is against the knight's oath to hurt those who are unarmed."

"But I must obey if you order so. In that case, you will have to use one of your Command Spells to compensate for treading inside me."
I am overwhelmed by her angered voice.


But still, I'm happy and relieved.
Her lack of doubt gave her the image of a cold fighting machine, but I know now that she is not a cold-blooded killer.

"Yeah, I won't let you do such a thing.
As you say, we have to do our best with what we can do. ...I'm really sorry. I insulted you without realizing it."

"Uh... no, I jumped to a hasty conclusion without knowing your intentions. You are not at fault, so please raise your head..."

"Huh? Oh sorry, I apologized without realizing it."
I raise my head.

I don't know what's funny, but Saber has a small smile on her face.

"...?"
Well, I'm glad she's smiling, so I won't ask her about it.

"...Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I said we'll do whatever we can, right? As one measure, I've decided to cooperate with Tohsaka for a while. Remember Archer's Master, who you were with for a while yesterday?"

"You mean Rin? ...I see, that is certainly an intelligent choice. There will be many things you can learn from her, until you become a suitable Master."

...Thank God.
If Saber agrees, I can proudly cooperate with Tohsaka.
The only other thing I need to ask her right now is

1) Which heroine is Saber?
2) Is she all right?
3) ...Where did you get those clothes?
I'm worried about Saber's body, after she was wounded so much.

"More importantly, Saber.
...Um, are you all right? The wound you took from Berserker was pretty bad."
"...? My body is just as it appears.
That wound was certainly one that would have led to my defeat, but it was not fatal. I finished healing it about an hour after Berserker left."

"Huh... then, you're completely healed now...?"
"Of course. But I am not back up to my normal condition yet.
Berserker's hit was a simple one, so it could be healed easily, but the wound made by Lancer's Noble Phantasm is different.
That lance must bear a special curse as the wound from him is not completely healed yet."


...Not completely healed, huh?
It doesn't look that way, but Saber isn't one to talk about her pain.
As long as I am fighting alongside Saber, I should pay attention and worry about her body.
It would be about Saber's real name.

"Saber. I heard this from Tohsaka already, but Servants are magics that summon heroic spirits, right?
Thenyou have a real name that's not your class name Saber, right?"

"Yes. The name Saber represents why I am here in this time. It is not a name to represent my real identity."

"I see. Then what is your real name?
Tohsaka said it wouldn't be a battle unless I knew my own Servant's real name."

Servants are heroic spirits.
Their identities are heroes, famous in every age.
They hide their identities and the scope of their power with their class names.

A Servant's real name is something that should be kept hidden.
But it is also something the Master must know.

Because if one does not know which hero the Servant is, he does not know the Servant's potential.
Master and Servant are one.
They won't be able to fight fully if one keeps a secret from the other.
They shouldn't be able to fight fully, but

"Shirou, about that matter, please excuse my rudeness.
A summoned Servant must immediately inform their Master of their true name. ...But I cannot fulfill that oath."
"Saber...? Why can't you fulfill this oath?"

"This is what I believe is for the best. No matter how hard you try to hide my name, there are many ways to take the information from you.
Since your magic resistance is not high, mental intervention would be simple if the enemy was a superior magus. If you were under a spell, my real name could be revealed against your will.
I would like to prepare for that and not have my real name within your knowledge."

"Oh, I see. That's right. I would give it right away if they used suggestion on me."
And informing the Master of your real name is for a normal Master and Servant.
Even if I knew Saber's real name, I wouldn't be able to come up with an effective plan. Most of all, I don't care about it.

"All right. Let's keep it a secret then. We have to take care, since I'm inexperienced."
"It helps me if you say that. ...But then, I am not someone that famous. I should be a few ranks below Berserker, and it would not do too much even if my name were revealed...."

Saber murmurs in regret.
...That's bit unexpected. Saber has some human characteristics, and she regrets being inferior to Berserker.

"Isn't that alright? A trump is a trump because it's hidden. Your Master is weak like this, so I understand that you have to try everything.
...And Berserker, he's unfair.
There's nothing to be ashamed of. Andfrom my point of view, you aren't inferior. You had that big wound, yet you were exchanging blows straight on."

"You are right. I suffered defeat last night, but the result should be different once my wound heals."
"EhUh, yeah. I hope... so."
I give an empty response and look away.
...That was a surprise attack.
When she smiles, Saber is

And then.
I hear a sound of something heavy falling at the door.
"Huh?"
I turn around, wondering what it was.

There...
...is Tohsaka with a big bag at her feet.

"Huh?"
My mind freezes.
Tohsaka, who supposedly went home, is at my dojo. She's wearing normal clothes for some reason, and why does she have that big bag?

"...Huh? What are you here for, Tohsaka?"
"I just went to go get my stuff from my house. It's natural, since I'll be living here from now on."

"...!!!!?
"L-Live... you mean you, living in my house...!!!?"

"That's what cooperation means. ...What did you think our talk was about earlier?"
"Uhum."
I'm so surprised I can't speak.
Something. I have to say something back, or something terrible is going to happen, but my head will not function.

"Where's my room? If you don't have one prepared, I'll choose one myself."
Still, the unexpected invader mercilessly continues the discussion.
"Ahhold on, that's"
Isn't this bad morally?

Look, Tohsaka is the idol at my school. Just having her in my house will cause a panic, so having her live here would be crazy and Fuji-Nee would kill me. Or maybe she's planning to drive me insane to reduce the number of Masters...!?

"Oh, why don't you prepare a room for her as well? Your Servant takes up space unlike my Archer, so you should give her a place to sleep. Well, I wouldn't mind if you guys shared the same bed."
Sharing the bed... that means sleeping in the same bed, right?

"Of course I won't! What are you saying while I'm not saying anything!? I wouldn't do such a thing, Saber is a girl...!"
"You're missing the point, but oh well. That's what Shirou says, Saber.
He says he doesn't like to be in the same room with a girl."

"......"
Not moving,Saber makes a difficult face.

"That is not good, Shirou. Servants are to protect their Masters. The hours of sleep are the most crucial time for protecting you, so I cannot protect you unless I am in the same room."
"I'm in more trouble even if you say that! What are you thinking, are you two really girls!?"

"......"
"......"
Why?
Why are you two looking silently at me like that?

"...Hmm. Servants are Servants, so there's no need to treat them as humans. But I guess it's useless to tell Shirou that."


My mouth, about to protest, stops.
The weird feeling I had when talking with Tohsaka in the living room returns.
Actually.
I've figured out the cause of this feeling.

"...Hold on, Tohsaka. Since when did you start calling me by my name?"
"Oh, am I? I wasn't really conscious of it, so it must have been a while ago."
"...It was. I think you've been calling me that for a while."

"I see.  I'll be careful if you don't like that, but you don't like it?"
Tohsaka says so plainly, without realizing how I'm feeling.
...Geez, it's just like you said, Issei.
I think Tohsaka Rin is a real devil.

"...Fine. Call me whatever you like. I don't care, whichever you prefer is fine."
"Really? Then I'll do that."
"Rin, please do not end the conversation. We have not come up with a solution to the matter of the room for Shirou and I."

"Oh, of course, of course. But it'll be hard to stay in the same room with Shirou acting like that. There's no point in treating a Servant like a human, but why don't you give up, since Shirou doesn't want it?"
"That is incorrect. Shirou only said it would trouble him, and he did not say he did not want it."
"Well then. What do you say, Shirou?"


Hold on.
Why, after only a day, does she keep on calling me Shirou like I'm a cat she found?
...No, that's not the problem, but Saber's room is.

"Shirou, I will ask you again. It is a Servant's duty to guard you while you sleep. I believe you understand your position as a Master."
Uh... even if you glare at me like that, I can't do it.

"...No. I'll prepare a separate room for Saber.
Um, I'll try to prepare one as close to mine as possible, so please be happy with that."

"S-Scaring me won't work! As a man, I won't surrender to you on this. Saber, you should understand your situation better...!"

"Huh? That is why I am trying to protect my Master as a Servant"
"No, I mean about yourself...! Geez, if you don't understand, that's fine! If you say any more, I'll make you obey using my Command Spell...!"
I breathe out hard and intimidate Saber.

"...It is troubling if you use your Command Spell for such a thing. Our future is doomed if you use one of the three rights to order me not to protect you."

"Yeah. I'm sure Shirou would be the first and the last Master to do that."
Don't be stupid. I don't want to use it for this either.

"...I understand, I will follow my Master's plan. But what will you do when you are attacked by an enemy? Servants such as Assassin will close in without letting their presence become known. In such cases, will you be able to protect yourself until I arrive?"

"Well"
I can't claim I'll manage.
I was able to against Lancer, but that luck won't repeat itself.

"That would be impossible. This house has a boundary field that alerts us if an enemy enters. We won't be able to avoid a raid, but we should be able to detect a surprise attack. In that case, you would be able to protect him before he was attacked, so you can just go ahead and stay in a room you like."

"...That is certainly true, but..."
"How about next to Shirou's room? You're fine if she's not in your room, right, Emiya-kun?"
She pronounces the "Emiya-kun" ostentatiously.

"Tohsaka, that's just sophistry, you know?"
"It's a sound argument because I'm making it for your sake. Well, which room should I choose?"
Tohsaka walks to the house with her bag, as if telling us the conversation is over.
She looks cheerful like a student picking her room on a field trip.

"......"

Perhaps because her actions are so selfish.
Saber and I just see her off with blank amazement.

We return to the main building.
First of all, I should show her around the house so she can choose her own room.

"This is the Japanese-style room. The back side has common rooms like the living room and the bathroom. And if you follow the open corridor to the outbuilding, you reach the guest rooms... It looks like Tohsaka went that way."

I explain as I walk.
Saber follows me silently without nodding. I'm not sure if she's listening or not.

"The map of the house is fine. Where is Shirou's room?"
"My room is this way. It's somewhat back there."

"Then please guide me that way. I must talk to you privately."
"Talk to me privately......?"
So she doesn't want Tohsaka to hear it?
Tohsaka is in the outbuilding, so I think this place is okay, but she is a Master after all.
Someone could overhear us, so the open corridor is no place to talk secretly.

"Here. This is my room."
"Whathis is Shirou's room?"
"Hm?"
Saber is surprised the moment she walks in.

"What? I don't think there's anything here that should be too surprising."
"No, there is nothing here to surprise me, as there is nothing here. Is this really your room, Shirou?"

"There's no point lying to you. I only come here to sleep, so it's natural there's nothing here."
"...I see. I was surprised. I thought you were a more assorted person."

Saber enters the Japanese-style room and touches the wall to check the feel of it.
It is a soft gesture, as if she understands the object's memory just by touching it.

"...I'm relieved. This is a desolate room, but that does not mean it is treated badly. This is a simple but warm place."
"Warm? ...Well, I guess so. I don't know if it's how the house is built, but this place is cool during the summer and warm during the winter. My father always said I took the good room."

"Yes, the room is the reflection of its owner, so I was worried about your spirit. But this will not change my impression of you now."
Saber says this with relief, but I don't understand what she wants to say.

"So? What did you want to talk privately about?"
"It is a bad thing. Something I do not want the other Masters to know at the very least."
"...Hm."
Judging by her expression, the bad thing must be our weakness.

"...I see. I see what you mean. I'll listen seriously, so go ahead."
"Yes, about that... this probably is not something we can solve.
We Servants maintain our body using the magical energy transferred from our Masters. That is why Servants require a Master. But"

"...I'm an incomplete Master, so I don't have enough magical energy for you to maintain your body?"

"No. It is not a problem if I receive even a small amount of magical energy from you. But I am not receiving any magical energy from you. The spiritual connection we ought to have is not present."


So that means...
I, as the gasoline, am not sending any fuel for Saber to work as an engine?

"Saber, that's..."
"It is not your fault. I believe something happened during my summoning. Some fault occurred, and the line that should have connected was not connected."

"Some problem during the summoning..."
When Saber appeared, it wasn't anything like a summoning.
It was just an accident.
Since she was summoned like that, it'd be strange if there weren't anything wrong with her.

"...Hold on. Then what's going to happen? Since you can't replenish your magical energy, will you disappear?"
"Yes. If I use up the magical energy I have, I will not be able to stay in this world."

"I have battled three times already since my summoning.
My healing ability is a regeneration magic, so magical energy consumption will increase if I take damage. ...Let me see, I used about ten mature magi's worth of magical energy last night."


I'm astonished.
Magical energy is reduced every time she fights and there's no way to restore it.
If she already used up that much magical energy, how much longer can she stay in this world?

"Do you understand, Master?
So I must try to use my magical energy as little as possible. If no magical energy is provided, I must sleep and suppress my magical energy usage."
"Sleep... um, will your magical energy replenish if you sleep?"

"...I do not know. But at the very least, I will not consume any magical energy while I am asleep.
So I wish for you to allow me to sleep as much as possible. I will not be able to constantly protect you, but I would like you to understand that this is a measure necessary for us to win."

"Oh"
I sigh with relief.
...Thank God. If that's all it is, I'll accept all she wants.

"Of course that's all right. You can rest when you get tired. If that allows you to stay longer, that's so much better."

"Then I will sleep often from now on, so please do not leave the house while I am doing so. If you are attacked somewhere far from here, I will not be able to come and protect you immediately."

"It would be a different story if I could leap through space, but Servants with such an ability are rare.
To call me from a distant place would require backup from the Command Spell, so I would like you to try to stay near me."

"...Hm."
As much as I'd like to do that, I can't nod.
I can't imagine living with Saber, and most of all, I have my own life as well.

"...I'll try. But are you sure that's all?
If you sleep, you"
"It should not be a problem. I cannot be certain since this has never happened to me, but I did not fight even seven times last time. Even if I do not defeat them, other Servants defeat other Servants."

"I see. So not everyone has to fight all the other Servants. If all goes well, we can end this war pretty easily."

The only people I am going to fight are those with inhuman attitudes.
I'm sure that not all of the seven Masters are like that.
Tohsaka is ready to fight, but she would follow the rules of the magi.

So the five remaining Mastersif they all have humane attitudes, I won't have to fight.
Saber said she didn't even fight seven times last time, so this time

"Huh?"
Hold on.
Even fight... seven times... last time?

"Hold on, Saber. Um, was it Saber too last time? No, I mean, were you in the last Holy Grail War as well...!?"

"This is the second time I have participated in the Holy Grail War.
I was Saber too at that time. There are heroic spirits that attribute to several classes, but I only correspond to the class of Saber."


Tohsaka mentioned...
That out of the seven, Saber is the most powerful Servant.
And this girl is saying she has become that twice in a row.

"Then... did you remain until the end last time?"
"Of course. I had no constraints last time, so I did not fall to any Servants."

Saber says this as if it's just something natural.
That makes me realize even more,that I have been given a sword I do not deserve.

"...Geez. Then you must be full of complaints with someone like me as your Master."
"I only fulfill the duties given to me. If I can obtain the Holy Grail, I have no complaints about my Master."

"I see. That's a relief, but still"
She was undefeated last time, but she has already suffered two wounds this time.

In her condition, unable to replenish magical energy, she always has to think about her remaining magical energy.
The result of a battle with such a burden was...
...That image of her covered in blood.


That image is engraved in my mind.
The image of a girl smaller than me, covered miserably in blood.

"Shirou, such regret is useless."
"Huh?"
Saber's voice brings me back.
When I raise my head, Saber's expression is serious.

"It is not as if I suffered no defeat.
I am your Servant now because I did not fully win. I am used to taking wounds, so it is not something you should mourn over."

"Used to...? Even wounds close to fatal?"
"Yes. To wield a sword means to take injury as well. That should be the same for you too. There is no reason for just me to avoid harm."

"That'strue. But are you saying that you don't mind getting hurt?"
"If it does not result in death. If I die, I will not be able to protect my Master."
"...What is that? So you're saying you don't mind getting hurt to protect your Master?"

"That is the role of the Servant.
...Rin's words are certainly correct. There is no need to treat Servants as humans. We are a tool to protect our Master. You must understand that."

Saying so, Saber walks to the sliding screen.
Beyond it is the side room.
This room was enough for me, so I never used it.

"I will be getting some sleep. I will wake up at dinnertime, so please let me know if you are going outside."
She quietly opens and closes the sliding door.

We are a tool to protect our Master.
You must understand that

"...What is that?"
That pisses me off.
But I can't call out to her, so I just consider her words in my mind.
It should be about those clothes of hers.

"By the way Saber. I want to ask you something."
"Yes, what is it?"
"Where did you get those clothes? I was surprised that you were wearing something different from yesterday."
Actually, I'm still surprised.

"They are something Rin has prepared for me. Since I cannot turn into spirit form, she gave me these so that I would not attract attention."
"Oh, I see."

"What about them?"
"Well, yeah, um..."
I try to say they look good on her, but I stop myself.
If I said such a thing, I'd blush red as a tomato.

"Shirou?"
"Uh... um, well... yeah, um.... oh, yesterday's armor!
Yeah, I was wondering what happened to the armor you were wearing yesterday!"

"You do not need to worry about it. I have control of when I wear the armor, so I have it off while I am wearing these clothes.
That armor is woven by my magical energy. I can call it forth as it is needed."


I can only sigh in admiration.
...Anyways, it is true that she would draw attention in her armor.
So with the way Saber's dressed now, I should be able to persuade people in the neighborhood that she is a relative of Kiritsugu.
...Well, I would have to do so anyway.
And then.
I hear the sound of something heavy falling at the door.
"Huh?"
I turn around, wondering what it was.

There...
is Tohsaka with a big bag at her feet.

"Huh?"
My mind freezes.
Tohsaka, who supposedly went home, is at my dojo, and she's wearing normal clothes for some reason, and why does she have that big bag?

"...Huh? What are you here for, Tohsaka?"
"I just went to go get my stuff from my house. It's natural, since I'll be living here from now on."

"Wha...!!!!?
L-Live... you mean you, living in my house...!!!?"

"That's what cooperation means. ...What did you think our talk was about earlier?"
"UhUh."
I'm so surprised I can't speak.
Something. I have to say something back, or something terrible is going to happen, but my head will not function.

"Where is my room? If you don't have one prepared, I'll choose one myself."
Still, the unexpected invader mercilessly continues the discussion.
"Ah hold on, that's"
Isn't this bad, morally?

Look, Tohsaka is the idol at my school. Just having her in my house will cause a panic, so having her live here would be crazy and Fuji-Nee would kill me. Or maybe she's planning to drive me insane to reduce the number of Masters...!?

"Oh, why don't you prepare a room for her as well? Your Servant takes up space unlike my Archer, so you should give her a place to sleep. Well, I wouldn't mind if you guys shared the same bed."
Sharing the bed... that means sleeping in the same bed, right?

"Of course I won't! What are you saying while I'm not saying anything!? I wouldn't do such a thing, Saber is a girl...!"
"You're missing the point, but oh well. That's what Shirou says, Saber.
He says he doesn't like to be in the same room with a girl."

"......"
Not moving,Saber makes a difficult face.

"That is not good, Shirou. Servants are to protect their Masters. The hours of sleep are the most crucial time for protecting you, so I cannot protect you unless I am in the same room."
"I'm in more trouble even if you say that! What are you thinking, are you two really girls!?"

"......"
"......"
Why?
Why are you two looking silently at me like that?

"...Hmm. Servants are Servants, so there's no need to treat them as humans. But I guess it's useless to tell Shirou that."


My mouth, about to protest, stops.
The weird feeling I had when talking with Tohsaka in the living room returns.
Actually.
I've figured out the cause of this feeling.

"...Hold on, Tohsaka. Since when did you start calling me by my name?"
"Oh, am I? I wasn't really conscious of it, so it must have been a while ago."
"...It was. I think you've been calling me that for a while."

"I see.  I'll be careful if you don't like that, but don't you like it?"
Tohsaka says so plainly, without realizing what I'm feeling.
...Geez, it's just like you said, Issei.
I think Tohsaka Rin is a real devil.

"...Fine. Call me whatever you like. I don't care, whichever you prefer is fine."
"Really? Then I'll do that."
"Rin, please do not end the conversation. We have not come up with a solution to the matter of the room for Shirou and I."

"Oh, of course, of course. But it'll be hard to stay in the same room with Shirou acting like that. There's no point in treating a Servant like a human, but why don't you give up since Shirou doesn't want it?"
"That is incorrect. Shirou only said it would trouble him, and he did not say he did not want it."
"Well then. What do you say, Shirou?"


Hold on.
Why, after only a day, does she keep on calling me Shirou like I'm a cat she found?
...No, that's not the problem, but Saber's room is.

"Shirou, I will ask you again. It is a Servant's duty to guard you while you sleep. I believe you understand your position as a Master."
Uh... even if you glare at me like that, I can't do it.

"...No. I'll prepare a separate room for Saber.
Um, I'll try to prepare one as close to mine as possible, so please be happy with that."

"S-Scaring me won't work! As a man, I won't surrender to you on this. Saber, you should understand your situation better...!"

"Huh? That is why I am trying to protect my Master as a Servant"
"No, I mean about yourself...! Geez, if you don't understand, that's fine! If you say any more, I'll make you obey using my Command Spell...!"
I breathe out hard and intimidate Saber.

"...It is troubling if you use your Command Spell for such a thing. Our future is doomed if you use one of the three rights to order me not to protect you."

"Yeah. I'm sure Shirou would be the first and the last Master to do that."
Don't be stupid. I don't want to use it for this either.

"...I understand, I will follow my Master's plan. But what will you do when you are attacked by an enemy? Servants such as Assassin will close in without letting their presence become known. In such cases, will you be able to protect yourself until I arrive?"

"Well"
I can't claim I'll manage.
I was able to against Lancer, but that luck won't repeat itself.

"That would be impossible. This house has a boundary field that alerts us if an enemy enters. We won't be able to avoid a raid, but we should be able to detect a surprise attack. In that case, you would be able to protect him before he was attacked, so you can just go ahead and stay in a room you like."

"...That is certainly true, but..."
"How about next to Shirou's room? You're fine if she's not in your room, right, Emiya-kun?"
She pronounces the "Emiya-kun" ostentatiously.

"Tohsaka, that's just sophistry, you know?"
"It's a sound argument because I'm making it for your sake. Well, which room should I choose?"
Tohsaka walks to the house with her bag, as if telling us the conversation is over.
She looks cheerful like a student picking her room on a field trip.

"......"

Perhaps because her actions are so selfish.
Saber and I just see her off with blank amazement.

We return to the main building.
First of all, I should show her around the house so she can choose her own room.

"This is the Japanese-style room. The back side has common rooms like the living room and the bathroom. And if you follow the open corridor to the outbuilding, you reach the guest rooms... It looks like Tohsaka went that way."

I explain as I walk.
Saber follows me silently without nodding. I'm not sure if she's listening or not.

"The map of the house is fine. Where is Shirou's room?"
"My room is this way. It's somewhat back there."

"Then please guide me that way. I must talk to you privately."
"Talk to me privately......?"
So she doesn't want Tohsaka to hear it?
Tohsaka is in the outbuilding, so I think this place is okay, but she is a Master after all.
Someone could overhear us, so the open corridor is no place to talk secretly.

"Here. This is my room."
"Whathis is Shirou's room?"
"Hm?"
Saber is surprised the moment she walks in.

"What? I don't think there's anything here that should be too surprising."
"No, there is nothing here to surprise me, as there is nothing here. Is this really your room, Shirou?"

"There's no point lying to you. I only come here to sleep, so it's natural there's nothing here."
"...I see. I was surprised. I thought you were a more assorted person."

Saber enters the Japanese-style room and touches the wall to check the feel of it.
It is a soft gesture, as if she understands the object's memory just by touching it.

"...I'm relieved. This is a desolate room, but that does not mean it is treated badly. This is a simple but warm place."
"Warm? ...Well, I guess so. I don't know if it's how the house is built, but this place is cool during the summer and warm during the winter. My father always said I took the good room."

"Yes, the room is the reflection of its owner, so I was worried about your spirit. But this will not change my impression of you now."
Saber says this with relief, but I don't understand what she wants to say.

"So? What did you want to talk privately about?"
"I have two things. Both are something I would like to keep a secret between us."

"Well, I don't mind if you say so, but tell me what it's about. I can't tell if it's something good or bad."

"They are both bad. At the very least, it is something I do not want other Masters finding out."
"Hm."
Judging by her expression, the bad thing must be our weakness.

"...... I see. I see what you mean. I'll listen seriously, so go ahead."
"Yes. First of all, I would like you to forgive me for not being able to accomplish the first obligation of a Servant."
"Hm? The first obligation of a Servant?"
"To tell you of my identity. Have you not heard about it from Rin?"
"Tell me your identityoh, you mean your real name."

Servants are heroic spirits.
Their identities are heroes, famous in every age.
They hide their identities and the scope of their power with their class names.
A Servant's real name is something that should be kept hidden.

But it is also something the Master must know.
Because if one does not know which hero the Servant is, he does not know the Servant's potential.
Master and Servant are one.
They won't be able to fight fully if one keeps a secret from the other.

Well, that's just how it would be if I were a normal Master.
Even if I knew Saber's real name, I wouldn't be able to come up with an effective plan. Most of all, I don't care about it.

"Hm. I'm fine with that, but why?"
"This is what I believe is for the best. No matter how hard you try to hide my name, there are many ways to take the information from you.
Since your magic resistance is not high, mental intervention would be simple if the enemy was a superior magus. I would like to prepare for that, and not have my real name within your knowledge."

"Oh, I see. That's right. I would give it right away if they used suggestion on me. All right, keep it a secret in that case."

"It helps me if you say that. ...But then, I am not someone that famous. I should be a few ranks below Berserker, and it would not do too much even if my name were revealed...."

Saber murmurs in regret.
...That's bit unexpected. Saber has some human characteristics, and she regrets being inferior to Berserker.

"Isn't that alright? A trump is a trump because it's hidden. Your Master is weak like this, so I understand that you have to try everything.
...And Berserker, he's unfair.
There's nothing to be ashamed of. Andfrom my point of view, you aren't inferior. You had that big wound, yet you were exchanging blows straight on."

"You are right. I suffered defeat last night, but the result should be different once my wound heals."

"Right? Okay then, that's the end of the first matter.
What's the second one about?"

"Yes, about that... this probably is not something we can solve.
We Servants maintain our body using the magical energy transferred from our Masters. That is why Servants require a Master. But"

"...I'm an incomplete Master, so I don't have enough magical energy for you to maintain your body?"

"No. It is not a problem if I receive even a small amount of magical energy from you. But I am not receiving any magical energy from you. The spiritual connection we ought to have is not present."


So that means...
I, as the gasoline, am not sending any fuel for Saber to work as an engine?

"Saber, that's..."
"It is not your fault. I believe something happened during my summoning. Some fault occurred, and the line that should have connected was not connected."

"Some problem during the summoning..."
When Saber appeared, it wasn't anything like a summoning.
It was just an accident.
Since she was summoned like that, it'd be strange if there weren't anything wrong with her.

"...Hold on. Then what's going to happen? Since you can't replenish your magical energy, will you disappear?"
"Yes. If I use up the magical energy I have, I will not be able to stay in this world."

"I have battled three times already since my summoning.

To call me from a distant place would require backup from the Command Spell, so I would like for you to try to stay near me."

"...Hm."
As much as I'd like to do that, I can't nod.
I can't imagine living with Saber, and most of all, I have my own life as well.

"...I'll try. But are you sure that's all?
If you sleep, you"
"It should not be a problem. I cannot be certain since this has never happened to me, but I did not fight even seven times last time. Even if I do not defeat them, other Servants defeat other Servants."

"I see. So not everyone has to fight all the other Servants. If all goes well, we can end this war pretty easily."

The only people I am going to fight are those with inhuman attitudes.
I'm sure that not all of the seven Masters are like that.
Tohsaka is ready to fight, but she would follow the rules of the magi.

So the five remaining Mastersif they all have humane attitudes, I won't have to fight.
Saber said she didn't even fight seven times last time, so this time

"Huh?"
Hold on.
Even fight... seven times... last time?

"Hold on, Saber. Um, was it Saber too last time? No, I mean, were you in the last Holy Grail War as well...!?"

"This is the second time I have participated in the Holy Grail War.
I was Saber too at that time. There are heroic spirits that attribute to several classes, but I only correspond to the class of Saber."


Tohsaka mentioned...
That out of the seven, Saber is the most powerful Servant.
And this girl is saying she has become that twice in a row.

"Then... did you remain until the end last time?"
"Of course. I had no constraints last time, so I did not fall to any Servants."

Saber says this as if it's just something natural.
That makes me realize even more,that I have been given a sword I do not deserve.

"...Geez. Then you must be full of complaints with someone like me as your Master."
"I only fulfill the duties given to me. If I can obtain the Holy Grail, I have no complaints about my Master."

"I see. That's a relief, but still"
She was undefeated last time, but she has already suffered two wounds this time.

In her condition, unable to replenish magical energy, she always has to think about her remaining magical energy.
The result of a battle with such a burden was...
...That image of her covered in blood.


That image is engraved in my mind.
The image of a girl smaller than me, covered miserably in blood.

"Shirou, such regret is useless."
"Huh?"
Saber's voice brings me back.
When I raise my head, Saber's expression is serious.

"It is not as if I suffered no defeat.
I am your Servant now because I did not fully win. I am used to taking wounds, so it is not something you should mourn over."

"Used to...? Even wounds close to fatal?"
"Yes. To wield a sword means to take injury as well. That should be the same for you too. There is no reason for just me to avoid harm."

"That'strue. But are you saying that you don't mind getting hurt?"
"If it does not result in death. If I die, I will not be able to protect my Master."

"That is the role of the Servant.
...Rin's words are certainly correct. There is no need to treat Servants as humans. We are a tool to protect our Master. You must understand that."

Saying so, Saber walks to the sliding screen.
Beyond it is the side room.
This room was enough for me, so I never used it.

"I will be getting some sleep. I will wake up at dinnertime, so please let me know if you are going outside."
She quietly opens and closes the sliding door.

We are a tool to protect our Master.
You must understand that

"...What is that?"
That pisses me off.
But I can't call out to her, so I just consider her words in my mind.
I sit on the porch and look up at the blue sky absent-mindedly.
I'm not like Saber who went to bed already during the day, but I need rest too.

Even though my nausea has gone away, I still feel terrible.
And on top of that, my shoulders are heavy from all the unexpected developments.

"Phew."
I take a deep breath and look over the yard.
I've heard what I needed to hear, but the fact that I still don't know anything doesn't change.
My Senpai as a magus, and an official Master, Tohsaka is...

"Hey, do you have an extra cushion? And a beaker and a protractor?"
...Is intently searching my house for things.

"...You can take the cushion in the next room.
But a normal household doesn't have beakers nor protractors."
"Huh? I can't believe it. A magus should always keep experimental tools around."
Leaving that complaint, she goes back to the outbuilding busily.

"...I guess she's serious."
I take another deep breath.
I guess it has already been decided that Tohsaka is going to stay at my place.
When I went over there earlier, there was a sign that said,"Remodeling in progress: Do not enter"
on the door of the best room in there.

"...Yeah. The outbuilding's pretty far away, so there's no problem."
Just having Saber around causes some tension, so if Tohsaka was near me too, I wouldn't get any peace.

Anyways, there's some distance between us. Even if we are connected by a hallway, it's just like a house next door, so nothing should happen unless I go there myself.

...Oh, but we'll see each other at meals.
And we only have the one bath, so we'll have to decide how to use it. No, thinking about that, Saber is a girl, too, so
"Idiot, what am I thinking...!?"
Shaking my head, I lie down in the corridor.

"Phew."
I sigh once again and stare up at the sky.
Maybe I'm tired, but doing all this makes me sleepy.
"Man, just"
...Do what you like. Becoming desperate, I close my eyes.

...Maybe that comment helped.
I fall asleep the moment I close my eyes.

Later, Saber, Tohsaka, and I are in the living room.
I just woke up.
Saber was in this living room,and Tohsaka just finished her remodeling.

By the way...
This was the guest room a few hours ago.
And now...
"Shirou, how do you use the air conditioner?"
The scene I saw when I was called was...
...This.

"...Man."
How can I put this... I think I may have allied with a terrible person.

"......"
I can't calm down.
These two are complete outsiders.
I rarely have guests at this house, so that must make the situation even stranger.

No, first of all.
The appearances of these two don't really fit this Japanese-style house.

"......"
Well, it's about seven o'clock now.
Even though we're all in the living room, all of us staying quiet like this is not good for my mental well-being.

"If you two don't mind, I'd like to talk about what to do from now on."
"Hold on. I want to decide on something before that. All right?"

"Uhsure. What is it?"
"About dinner. Shirou, you live alone, right?"
"...? Well, yeah."
"Then you have cooked for yourself, right?"
"Of course. I'll get hungry if I don't eat."

"I see. Then I have a proposal. How about we take turns preparing dinner? We'll be living together for a while, so that should be helpful, right?"
"...Hmm. You're right. I was thinking of continuing as usual, but if you're going to be living here, you're just like family. It's normal for you to cook, and it'll be easier on me too."

"Then it's decided. So, let's say it's Shirou's turn today.
It's late already, so let's have our meeting after dinner."
"Huh? Well, I don't mind taking turns for dinner, but what are we going to do about breakfast? Will we be taking turns too?"

"Oh, breakfast's fine. I don't eat breakfast."
"What's that? Don't be ridiculous. You won't grow if you don't eat breakfast."

"Mind your own business. Don't cut into my lifestyle.
...Anyways, you'll be preparing dinner! I won't talk unless you cook something good, okay?"
Tohsaka glares at me irritatedly.

"...All right. I'll make something... Saber, you're eating too, right?"
"Certainly, if you will prepare some for me. Food is an important source of energy."
"All right. Then be good, you two."

I grab the apron and go to the kitchen.
Fortunately, there's about three people's worth of ingredients in the refrigerator.
I started cooking rice when I woke up, so it should be done in about half an hour.

I glance at Tohsaka and Saber from the kitchen.
"...Hm."
They look like they'd prefer western meals over Japanese food.
It's unlikely that Saber, let alone Tohsaka, will understand the tastes of tofu and natto.

"No, more importantly, Saber might not be able to use chopsticks."
I ponder this for a second, but I can't help it.
There's only a limited range of dishes I can make with what's in the fridge.

Anyways, there's some tofu.
After thinking for a bit, I decide to make some deep-fried tofu. For soup, I'll make miso soup with seaweed and tofu.
I have some chicken, so I'll make teriyaki out of it and make that the main dish.

I drain the water off the tofu, season the chicken, and cut the Japanese white radish while I'm at it to make salad. I grate the white radish, cook some green peppers

"Are your plans from now on determined, Rin?"
"Who knows? I can't say much since I don't have any information, but I think it's most important to find out about the other Masters.
There are four more Masters. I want to search for them without them realizing I'm a Master, but it probably won't go perfectly."

...Hm.
I told them to be good, so what's with that dangerous conversation?
Can't they see that I'm busy making dinner for the three of uno, they aren't even looking.

"Tohsaka! Not four, five! The only Masters we know are you and me!"
I yell, holding the big pot for the deep-fried tofu.

"What are you talking about? You, me, and Ilyasviel makes three. Did you already forget about Berserker?"
"Oh."

...Oh yeah, that girl is a Master too.
Berserker was so strong that I forgot, but stillI can't believe a girl that small is a Master who mercilessly tried to kill us.

"I understand. You're you, so I bet you didn't see her as an enemy. It's fine, so concentrate on the cooking. It'll be a problem if I can't judge how good you are."

"Uh?"
I don't know how my cooking skill affects her, but what she says is correct.
The preparation will be done soon, so I should concentrate on finishing dinner now.

"Ilyasviel... you must mean Berserker's Master.
"Rin, you seemed to know her."
"...Yeah, I know her name. Einzbern is a magus family lineage that has almost made it to the Holy Grail a few times."

"...So they are well-accustomed to the Holy Grail War?"
"I would think so. I don't know about the others yet, but I can't be wrong in saying that Ilyasviel is our biggest obstacle. Usually, Berserker is a class chosen to strengthen a weak hero.
It takes sanity away as compensation for strengthening the hero, but to control such an 'insane Servant' requires enormous amounts of magical energy.[l]
For example, if you became Berserker"

"I would not be able to talk like I am doing now. Removing all roles as a collaborator and specializing in battle is how Berserker is. But that is like subduing a wounded lion. A normal magus will not be able to control it."

"I'll bet. A normal magus cannot control Berserker even when some minor hero becomes it.
But Ilyasviel summoned a top-grade hero, made him Berserker, and controlled him completely.
...It's irritating, but her ability as a Master is on a completely different level."

"...I feel the same way. Our current problem is that this exact Master is after us."
"Yeah. My Archer hasn't healed enough to return to battle. How about you, Saber? Is your injury okay now?"

"...It will not be a problem if I am to fight normally, but I am not healed enough to fight Berserker.
The injury from the battle against Berserker is healed, but it seems it will take longer to heal the wound I received from Lancer."

"I see. Then I guess all we can do is wait and see for now."
"I have a suggestion about that. I hear Archer has sharp eyes. Would it be wise to have him keep watch around the house?"

"That's what I've been planning to do. I'll have him keep watch on the roof, so we should know right away if anyone strange is approaching this place. This house has a boundary field that warns of intruders, so our defenses are perfect.
...Though, if Berserker comes and attacks us, all we can do is run."

The two are continuing on without me.

I'm a bit annoyed.
I'm making dinner, so why are they talking without me?

First of all, Tohsaka is too friendly with Saber.
...Well, it's true that Tohsaka isn't that friendly with me, so it helps if Saber talks to her, but

"Hm?"
The face reflected in the glass of the kitchen cabinet looks disappointed.
...That's weird. Why am I angry?

"All right."
I prepare the dishes for the three of us and put the prepared dinner on the tray.
I move to the living room.
"Geez, don't talk about dangerous stuff during dinnertime."
I put the tray in front of Tohsaka.

"Huh? What are you angry about, Shirou? Oh, should I have at least helped carrying it out?"
"I'm not angry. But weren't you not going to be friendly?"
I glare at her.

Tohsaka goes "huh?", and after that...
...Makes a frightening smile.

"We were just deciding on the structure for cooperation. Don't worry, I won't steal your Saber."
"!"
I can tell my face is blushing.
I can tell what I'm angry about after Tohsaka tells me.

"Y-Y-You"
"Oh, was I mistaken? Then I'm sorry, Emiya-kun."
"Guh, you...... oh, just keep talking!"
I retreat to the kitchen to get the rest of the food.

...Uhh, she really got me.
Tohsaka is still smiling and Saber is expressionless as always.
...Man. I'm really worried about whether we can continue with this member...

In that way, dinner starts.

I'm silent.
With what happened earlier, it annoys me to talk to Tohsaka, and I'm too embarrassed to even look at Saber.

"......"
Saber eats dinner silently.
Her gestures are elegant, and I can't possibly imagine she was swinging around a sword.

And, well, how should I put this....
"...Hmm. ...Hmm, hmm."
She nods every time she eats something she hasn't eaten before.
Her gestures are strange.
It must be her way of expressing that it's good.
By the way, she is able to use the chopsticks.

On the other hand, Tohsaka is...
"All right, I'll win...!"
She clenches her fist after taking a bite.

"Fufu, wait until tomorrow, Emiya Shirou...!"
She shakes her clenched fist.

God.
Have I done something bad?

"Um, about what you guys were talking about."
"Hm?"
The two both raise their heads.


Hold on. Hold on hold on hold on hold on.
Even one of them is enough to tense me up, so they shouldn't both react.

"What are you referring to?"
"...About what to do from now on. You guys were talking about it while I was cooking."
"About searching for other Masters for now?"
"Yeah, that. I was wondering what exactly you were going to do?"

"Well... we can only look for them slowly.
Oh, yeah. Can you at least sense other magi's presence? It'll be easy if that's the case."

"No. I went to the same school as you for two years and I still didn't realize you were a magus, Tohsaka."
"Just as I thought.... Well, that's fine. The others would be hiding their presence, so it should be impossible to find them from their traces anyways.
How about you, Saber? I hear Servants can detect other Servants."

"I can somewhat, but only when they are using their abilities nearby. In my case, I can only detect them within about a two hundred meter radius."
"I see. Then we'll have to wait for their actions or find some place where it seems strange. If a Master acts, their traces should remain. So that means we are going to try to find those."

"So, are you saying we should search throughout the town?"
"No, you shouldn't do that. They'll be searching too, so that'll tell them right away that you're a Master."

"For now, we shouldn't take the initiative until we are prepared.
Go through life as you were and don't let them know that you're a Master.
Hide the Command Spell so no one will see it.
Try not to go to desolate places.
Come home before dark.
And, what else..."

"Please try to take your Servant with you when you go outside. Can Archer guard you, Rin?"
"I guess he can do that much. I'll have him ready in spirit form, so it should be okay. The problem is"
"My Master."

"Right. Are you listening, Shirou? Take Saber with you when you go anywhere. It's our rule to stay out of people's sight, but some idiot might attack us in the middle of the day.
Have Saber with you in case of things like that."

"All right. I'll try."
I respond without interest.
I understand what she's saying, but I'm resistant to being with Saber all the time.

I feel nervous talking to Tohsaka, but Saber makes me even more nervous.
...No, it's wrong to say I'm nervous.
I'm just bad at talking with Saber.

"What is it?"
"Nothing. I'll give you more, so give me your bowl."
"No, I am fine. It was very good, Shirou."

"!"
I look away before I realize.
...I can't even look at her normally, so how can I stay with her all the time?

"Oh, it's no good, though. Saber can't become a spirit, so she won't be able to follow you to school."
"School...? Are you a student, Shirou?"

"That's right... Oh, Saber isn't a student, so she can't enter the school.... She'll just have to stay here while I go to school."
"...Can't you not go to school, Shirou?"

"I can't. If you want me to live normally, I have to go to school. And there's no danger at school. There aren't many places with that many people."
"But..."

"It's all right, Saber. I'll be at school too, so I'll back him up in case of emergencies."
"I'm saying there won't be any emergencies."
So I declare.

"...I understand. If Master says so, I will obey."
Saber nods, though she looks discontent.

The night wears on.
It seems Tohsaka has prepared and taken her bath while I was cleaning up after dinner.
Geez, it seems she's really selfish from her first day here.

"...I should seize the initiative from now on..."
I know that, but seizing the initiative from her seems really difficult.

"...Man. On the subject of difficulties, there's one more that's giving me trouble..."
No, rather, the main problem.
Tohsaka will understand if I talk to her, but this person doesn't seem to understand however much I talk to her.

"...Saber, huh? I know she's not a bad person but..."
Saber is back in her room.
Tohsaka should be resting in her room in the outbuilding.

I'm the only one in the living room.
There's still time until bedtime, so I should talk to Saber.
...Honestly, I have to get over my inability to talk to her, or I'm worried about our future.

First of all, ignoring her being a Servant and all, she is a girl from a younger age.
There are a lot of things I'll find out from talking to her, and most of all...

"...I have to get used to her, or Tohsaka will constantly make fun of me..."
Yeah, that's troubling.
It's troubling, so I should be able to talk to her more lightheartedly.
I return to my room.
Next door, past this one small sheet, is Saber's room.

"...Saber, are you awake?"
"I am awake. Is something wrong, Master?"
Opening the sliding screen silently, Saber enters.

"Uh."
I hold onto my heart, pounding from having her actually in front of me.
...Calm down. I'm just going to talk to her as a Master.

"Shirou? You do not look so well. Have your wounds opened up?"
"Uhno, that's not it. I'm fine already. Are you fine?"

"Yes, there is no problem. With my current condition, it should take some time to fully heal, but I am still above my average. I should be able to match anyone other than Berserker."

Saber declares so.
It's not confidence or boasting.
She is probably just telling the truth.


I have no response.
Saber's statement should be encouraging to a Master, but II don't want such a slender girl to fight.

"Um... I'll ask you something. Don't you have any other objective other than fighting? You're in this time, so don't you have anything else you want to do?"

"Other objectives...? I do not have any such things. Servants are only summoned to fight.
Any other objectives are useless. Your statements are misdirected."

I thought so.
I'm pretty much asking one who was summoned to fight, not to fight.
It's not that I want to tell her that.
Well, how should I put thisSaber is lacking in humanity.
It would be fine if she were only going to fight, but she's in front of me as an actual person.

So I can't allow her to just fight.
If Saber is actually here, I have to have her do something she enjoys.

"Hey, Saber. Servants are heroes from the past, right? So"
I stop myself before I ask her what she was like before.

 'I cannot tell you my real name.'[r]
Saber said that before as a secret between us.
So even if I asked her about her past, she wouldn't answer.

"Shirou? It is not good to stop what you have begun to say. I shall answer if it is necessary."
"No, forget about it. I was just about to say something stupid."

I say that, averting my gaze.
...It really was something stupid.
I shouldn't have been interested in Saber's true identity, and she refused because she couldn't tell me.
If I bring it up again, it will only prove that I'm a no-good Master, repeating a useless question.

"......"
But what else is there to talk about besides that?
If I can't ask about Saber, the only thing that remains is about me.
...That would be even more meaningless though.

"Hm."
Now, I'm just gonna do what I want.
If I can't ask about her true identity, I'll get ready to have her look at me strangely, and I'll ask about things such as what she likes and what she wants for breakfast and

"Shirou. If you do not have any questions, may I ask you?"
"Huhyou can, but what?"

"About yesterday. You were cut by Berserker while trying to save me. You remember that, is that correct?"

"I remember... what? You want to continue this morning's conversation? I know it was a thoughtless action, so don't remind me about it. It makes me feel sick."

"I feel the same way. But I feel that I must ask you to understand.
Why did you stand up to Berserker?
Did you not understand what might happen to you if you approached us?"

"That's"
I knew that.
I understood that I'd be killed if I approached.
But I didn't try to save Saber out of optimism that I'd be safe while doing so.

...Back then, all I thought about was saving Saber.
I didn't care about what would happen afterwards.
At that time, the most important thing for me was saving Saber.

...Probably, it was just that my fear of not being able to save Saber was greater than my fear of getting killed.

"...Sorry, I've forgotten.
It happened in an instant, so I don't know what I was thinking. I was probably confused. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to do something so suicidal."

Perhaps because Saber's eyes were so serious.
I don't tell her the truth. I just say something to get out of this situation.

"...So in other words, you automatically tried to save me?"
"It wasn't automatic. I told you, I was confused.
If something like that happens again, I'll probably be trembling."

"I see. That is normal for a human. No human would try to save another while ignoring their own life.
Even heroes should be no exception to that."

"Soif someone like that exists, they would be lacking something.
If he continued with that missing thing, only tragedy would await."

Her deep green eyes are trying to tell me something.

...I take that and...
"You're persistent, Saber. I told you I was just confused. I'm scared of death too. I can't be a saint.
...If something like that happens again, I'll save myself before you."
...I deflect it with heartless words.

"That is good. It should be no problem if it was just a misinterpretation on my part. Yes, you certainly are a coward. If you do not make any mistakes, you will become a proper magus."
"Hey. What's with that? Do I look like a coward?"

"Yes, very much so. Mostly the part where you try your best to accept the situation you are in. Such wisdom is sometimes called as cowardice. It is the same as saying that a man without fear cannot be wise."

She must be relieved.
Saber says this, smiling a bit.


That gesture is so lovely and elegant.
Because of it, I cannot think of anything else to say, and we end up staying in the room together a while.
...And night falls.
It's not like I need to talk to Saber or Tohsaka, so bedtime comes as usual.

It's eleven o'clock.
The lights in the house are turned off, and the people in it sleep to prepare for tomorrow.

......
............
..................
"I can't sleep."

I open my eyes, still on my side.
It's the room I've grown accustomed to sleeping in, but it's different today.

"...Geez. Why can I"
It's so quiet, so why can I hear Saber's breathing in the next room?
No, I know. If it's so quiet, it's only natural for me to be able to hear what's going on in the next room, and being able to hear her sleeping makes me imagine her sleeping.

"...Ugh, dammit...! I can't sleep like this...!"
I'm tired of this hell.
I climb out of the futon trying not to wake Saber, and I retreat to my usual place.

"...Thank God. I thought Saber would notice, but she must be pretty dull."
Or maybe she just sleeps deeply.
I wonder for a moment whether she can really protect her Master like that, but there's no danger now.
If Servants are connected to their Masters, she should wake up when her Master is in danger.

"Tohsaka... seems to be asleep."
The lights there are off.
She must be defiant, or just adaptable.
Tohsaka must have gotten used to this place in just a day.

"...Well, it really does help having her around and all."
Yeah, it helps, even if it's troubling sometimes.
For example, the bandage wrapped around my hand.

"Hide the Command Spell, huh? I didn't realize until she told me."
The Command Spell a Master bears appears somewhere on their arm.
In my case, it is on the back of my left hand.
I can't hide it with my clothes, so I'm hiding it with a bandage, even though it looks unnatural.

"...It's winter, so I'll wear something long over it."
Tohsaka has hers around the middle of her right hand, or somewhere like that.
They say the Command Spell is different for each Master, but I don't think I'll ever see Tohsaka's Command Spell.

The shed is silent.
This is the place where Lancer cornered me yesterday.
And where Saber appeared.
The door is still open and the inside is dark as if denying anyone's entry.

But this darkness is familiar to me.
The old building that I used to play in, the place you could call my real room, stands silently in the cold winter night.

...I enter.
I close the door to shut out the outside air, and turn on the old stove.

"Yeah, I considered skipping it just for today, but I shouldn't. Father would get mad at me if I skipped it two days in a row."
I sit in the middle of the shed and take a deep breath.
...Training should be continued without rest.
Magic is mental training for me, so I shouldn't neglect it for minor reasons.

"Phewhuh."
...I adjust my breathing and begin my training.
Inside my head is the usual image.
The image of the sword that appears in my empty head.


I ignore it and clear my mind.
Once I let magical energy flow through me, it's the usual practice of "strengthening".

The strengthening magic, which I succeeded at for the first time in a few years after being attacked by Lancer.
I have to repeat it before I forget it, and make sure I master it, or it'll be a waste.
"Trace, on."
I half-close my eyes and release the contents of my lungs.

Right now, this is all.
Everything goes away once I'm concentrating on this. The Holy Grail War, Saber, Tohsaka...
If I empty my mind and forget all the doubts I have, I should be able to sleep tonight
...There's no choice from the start.
There are too many things I don't know, and I'm unskilled as a magus.
Even if it's temporary, if Tohsaka is going to give me a hand, I don't think there's any better option.

"All right. I'll take that offer, Tohsaka. Honestly, it will really help me out if you do so."

"Then it's decided. Let's shake hands. For now, let's stay allies until we beat Berserker."
"Oh... I see. That's how it'll be, huh? I guess it can't be helped, but that's easier to understand."

I shake her hand.
...I'm a bit perplexed.
The instant I feel Tohsaka's soft hand, I realize she is a girl.
In comparison, my hand covered in scratches from messing around with stuff is ill-suited.


The instant I think so, I pull back, embarrassed.

"What? You don't want to cooperate with me after all?"
"No, it's not that. It's a real help to be able to ally with you. It's not that, so don't worry about it."

After making a puzzled face,"Ohhhhh."
She makes a malicious expression.

"W-What? I'll take back the agreement if you say something stupid. I will. I really will!"
"Was that the first time you've held a girl's hand?
You seem to have lots of friends, but you're actually shy, Shirou."

"N-No! It's not that, but..."
I'm just embarrassed because it was Tohsaka... but I can never say such a thing, and certainly I have never touched a girl so strongly before.

...Well, Fuji-Nee is an exception.
She's more like someone from a different planet than from a different sex.
"Hey, hold on."
Wasn't there something weird in what she just said...?

"Ahaha, you really do show you feelings on your face like I've heard. Well, I won't ask you about it for now. It'll be a problem if I poke fun at you and you get sulky."

"Then here's a deposit. I'll give you this, so think of it as proof of our alliance."
Tohsaka puts a book on the table.

It looks just like a diary.
There's no title and it is wine-red.
...The color seems to suit Tohsaka.

"It's my father's, but I'll give it to you since I don't need it anymore. It's not something a full Master needs, but I thought you might need it."
Tohsaka's eyes tell me to take a look.

"...Then excuse me."
I open it to a random page.

Then.
There's nothing written in the book, but a strange image pops into my head.

"...!?? Tohsaka, what is this?"
"It's the status of each of the Servants. You already know the Holy Grail War has its set of rules, right? It's the same for the Servants."

"First of all, only seven heroic spirits are summoned.
Those seven can be summoned only after they become one of the predetermined classes that the Holy Grail has prepared in advance. Instead of bringing the actual heroic spirit, it made a class similar to the spirit and called it into that."

"Spiritual spells which call forth spirits put the spirit in the caster's body, right? It's like that.
To call forth a spirit from a different timeframe, it's easier to prepare a case for them in advance."

"Class... oh, that's why Saber is Saber!"
"That's right. I told you, heroic spirits need to hide their identity, right? That's why they will never say their real names. Naturally, their summoned class becomes their name."

"So, the seven classes prepared are:[vr]
Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin, Berserker."

"There is a change in one or two of the classes every Holy Grail War, but we have a basic lineup this time. The standard opinion is that Saber is the best Servant.
Each class has their own special characteristics, but the abilities of the Servants differ according to the rank of the heroic spirit summoned."

"Rank of the heroic spirits... you mean how strong they were when they were alive?"

"That also, but what strengthens their ability is their popularity.
What they did and what weapons they had do not change, but their basic abilities change depending on how famous they are in this time.
Heroic spirits are like gods, so they grow stronger the more people worship them."

"I guess you can say it solidifies their presence. It's the same as divine spirits falling to the rank of spirits when they lose their faith. Heroes that are forgotten by the people do not have much power.
But then, even if they are forgotten or unknown, if he was originally a powerful hero, then I think he can keep his powers to some extent."

"...Then if it's a hero everyone knows, and if their story was extraordinary"
"They would undoubtedly be a Rank A Servant.
Berserker might be the strongest in that regard too.
After all, he is the most famous hero in Greek mythology.
The heroes from the age of gods have special Noble Phantasms just because of that, and if the hero itself is strong to add to that, there's nothing much we can do."

"...Tohsaka. Um, what is this 'Noble Phantasm'?"
"It's the symbol that the Servant used in their life. Heroes and their holy swords or demonic swords come as a set, right? So in other words, their weapons."
"...? Weapons... you mean like Saber's invisible sword?"

"Yeah. I don't know what history it has, but it certainly is her Noble Phantasm.
I don't think I even need to say, but heroes cannot stay in a legend with just their names.
They each have a weapon that became their trademark.
That is the most powerful weapon, called a Noble Phantasm, the crystallization of people's desire for a miracle."

"Hmm... so in short, a powerful magical item?"

"Right. To be blunt, heroes themselves cannot match powerful spells or divine mysteries.
But it's a different story when the Noble Phantasms come in.
Heroes wielding Noble Phantasms can even defeat spirits of several ranks higher.
It's because most holy and demonic swords appearing in legends are close to the level of sorcery."

"Swords that kill dragons which are the most powerful fantasia race, shoes that run far and wide, and even god-killing demonic swords.
...Anyways, the weapons heroes have are so extraordinary, it makes you wonder how they cannot be all-mighty.
I'm not overstating saying that the battle between Servants is concentrated in the battle between the Noble Phantasms."

"...So, Servants that are heroic spirits have at least one Noble Phantasm?"

"Yes. As a general rule, one hero can only hold one Noble Phantasm.
Usually something like a sword or a spear. There's this weapon called the mountain-destroying sword in China, right? You can only swing it once, but it's a magical sword so one swing will even destroy a mountain and such. I think it's kind of like that."

"However, Noble Phantasms are miracles that need to be activated by stating their true name, so it's not something they can use easily."

"...? It's activated just by saying the weapon's name, right? Why would that mean it can't be used easily?"

"Hey now, if you know the name of the weapon, you can also tell which hero the Servant is.
A hero and his weapon come as a set, so once you know the name of the weapon, you naturally know the name of the owner. If that happens, you know every strength and weakness of that Servant."

"I see. Certainly, that's true."
Saber did work out Lancer's identity after he used his Noble Phantasm.
Something like being Ireland's child of light...

"Hm."
So, if I summarize this...
Servants are separated into classes, each of them a heroic spirit suited to their class.

These heroic spirits hide their identity.
And their weapons are their greatest trump card, but they cannot readily use them since they reveal their identity.

"That concludes the lecture on Servants.
You should learn the details if you read that book, so take a look at it when you have time. If you get used to it, you should be able to identify the Servant from intuition without the book."
Saying that, Tohsaka stands up.

"Well then, I'm heading home."
"Huh? Yeah, thanks."
I look up at Tohsaka, who's about to leave.

"Don't take this the wrong way. Even though we're cooperating right now, in our position, we will eventually have to fight. Once all the other Masters are dead, or even if they are alive, this fact will not change.
Soit'll be easier if you don't think of me as human, Emiya-kun."

Clearly stating our position, Tohsaka goes home.

I feel the white sunlight upon me.
There must be a draft. I feel a cold wind and slowly wake up.

"Huh... it's the shed"
I pick my body up and shake my sleepy head.
"I see, I fell asleep here yesterday."
After yesterday's routineafter the training to create another sensation within me, I must have been too lazy to return to my room.

"It must still be before six. ...Damn, I should prepare breakfast."
I fold up the blanket, straighten up the things I failed to "strengthen" yesterday, and head back to the house to wash my face.

"It's cold."
When I leave the shed, it's really cold outside.
Fuyuki City is warm during the winter, but the top of the mountain on this side has the chill of a normal winter.

"Oh, there's some frost... I should do something about the lawn soon."
The sound of breaking ice.
There is frost on the ground and footprints are formed as I walk.

So.
I wash my face with freezing water and pull myself together.

"All right."
I'm wide awake now.
Now that I'm awake, all the things I don't want to think about, like the situation I'm in, come straight to mind.

"...Oh yeah. I shouldn't be washing my face so calmly......"
It's five to six.
There are a ton of things I have to do, but I should return to my room and check on Saber first.

"...Yeah. I guess I left the room without saying anything, so I should explain things to her."
I'll be troubled if Saber misunderstands things.
...It's my daily routine to go out to the shed at night, so she should understand if I explain.

"After explaining things to Saber, I should make breakfast. ...It seems Tohsaka won't be eating, so I should just add Saber's share."
Oh. In that case, I should go and buy more ingredients for the additional people. I should note that before I forget.

"...Hm? I'm sure I'm forgetting something..."
What could it be?
It feels like I'm forgetting something really important

"Gah, it's six. I have to hurry or I won't make it."
Well, if I can't remember, it can't be anything important.


I quietly open the door.
The room is just like it was yesterday.
There's no sign of Saber waking up in the middle of the night and searching this room.
I guess she didn't realize that I escaped the room last night.

"...That's kind of a letdown. I thought Saber might notice."
Or did she need sleep so much that she couldn't notice?

"...I see. That must be what she means when she said she needs to sleep frequently."
That must be why she's sleeping as close to me as she can, so she can come to me in case something does happen.

"......"
Either way, it won't make much difference where I go if it's within the house.
I can detect intruders from the boundary field.
I should be able to protect myself for about a minute with that, and Saber should be able to come save me in a minute wherever I may be in this house.

"...That's right. And if it's the shed, there'll be plenty of places to hide."
Anyways, I shouldn't be scolded at for what I did last night.
I was considering explaining this to Saber, but it seems there's no need for that. And I don't think I should wake her up either if she's asleep.

"Saber, I'm going to prepare breakfast. I'll prepare some for you, but you don't have to get up if you're tired.
I'll come get you later, so rest until then."
I call out to her and quietly leave the room.

There's no one in the living room.
I open the refrigerator and consider what I should make for breakfast.

And then.
"Mornin'. You're up pretty early."
Tohsaka comes in, looking like she's in a really bad mood.

"T-Tohsaka...? What, did something happen...!?"
"Nothing. I'm always like this in the mornings, so don't worry."
Tohsaka crosses the living room like a ghost.

"Hey, are you all right? You don't look all right."
"I'm telling you, don't worry, I'll wake up when I wash my face. ...Uh, how do I get to the bathroom from here?"

"You can take that hallway. There's a bathroom in the hallway by the entrance if you're going to wash your face."
"Oh yeah, there was one there, wasn't there?"
I'm not sure how much she heard, but Tohsaka waves her hand and leaves.

And then.
Just as Tohsaka disappears into the hallway, I hear a bell informing me of a visitor.

"Shirou? Someone's here?"
I hear Tohsaka's voice from the hallway.
"Oh, don't worry about it! Only my friends come at this time!"
It'll be Sakura arriving at this time.
Sakura has a spare key, so I shouldn't need to go to the door.

"...Geez. She never listens, even though I keep telling her she doesn't need to ring the bell."
Sakura is like a member of the family, so she can come in when she wants.
But she's polite, and she only comes in after saying "excuse me".
That must be one of Sakura's good points, but if she's considerate all the time, she'll


Hold on.
Sakura... is... at my house...?

"...!!!"
I run through the hallway.
Scolding myself for my stupidity comes later.
I have to get to the entrance and make her go home before she sees Tohsaka!

"Haa... haa...!"
I reach the entrance, out of breath.
But it's too late.
There...


...Is Tohsaka, greeting the guest, even though I didn't ask her to,"Huh?"
and Sakura, just standing there, surprised.

Sakura is at the door, and Tohsaka is in the hallway.
With an indescribable tension, the two look at each other.

"Good morning, Matou-san. Are you surprised to see me here?"
Tohsaka asks, as if looking down on Sakura from the hallway.

"Tohsaka... Senpai."
Her face asks why.
Sakura looks up at Tohsaka with fear in her eyes.


Damn it.
I can't call out to them.
They are ignoring me and staring at each other.
There's no room for me to say anything.

All I can do is to think how to explain things to Sakura, but before I can think up a good explanation....
"Senpai... what is this...?"
Sakura looks at me as if asking for help.

"Yeah. Well, it's a long story"
"It's not long. I'm just staying over here."
Clearly.
She cuts off my sentence and just states the point.

"...Senpai, is that true?"
"The short answer is yes. There are circumstances, so I have her staying here now.
...Sorry, I forgot to tell you and surprised you."

"P-Please don't apologize, Senpai. ...Um, I was certainly surprised, but that's fine. But what you said, you really"
"Yes, this is what Shirou and I have decided. The head of the household, Shirou, decided, so that's how it is.
You understand what this means, right, Matou-san?"

"...Understand what?"
"It seems you have been taking care of Shirou up to now, but this means he doesn't need that anymore. It'll be a bother if you come here, and it's for your sake not to come here."


Sakura looks down and falls silent.
After a brief moment of silence...
Suddenly,"...I don't understand."
Sakura states so in a clear, small voice.

"Uhhuh?"
"...I said, I have no idea what Tohsaka-Senpai is talking about."

"H-Hey Sakura"
"Excuse me. Senpai, I'll be using the kitchen.
Sakura enters the house with a bow and goes into the living room, ignoring Tohsaka.

"Wha"
Tohsaka is standing there, astonished.
The same goes for me too. This is the first time I've seen Sakura act like that, so I don't know what to say.
...No, that is surprising, but something else was unexpected too.

"Hey, Tohsaka. How did you know Sakura was coming over to my house? I don't remember telling you about it."

"Huh? Oh, I heard about it before somewhere. It's just a coincidence.
But I'm surprised. Is she always so energetic here? She's totally different from when she's at school."

It must have been really unexpected, as Tohsaka says this with disappointment.
That must mean Tohsaka knows Sakura pretty well.

Sakura seems to have known Tohsaka, so they must have had a friendship I didn't know about.
...Well, that aside.

"No, I'm surprised as well. That's the first time I've seen Sakura be so snappy. She's just the way she is at school when she comes to help around here. I'd say this is a special case."
"Hmmm, I see... this is bad, I never knew Sakura was so perverse. I should have let you explain things."

She's right.
I would have been able to explain things better than the merciless Tohsaka.

"What's done is done. But what's bad about it?"

"Of course it's bad. This place might turn into a battlefield. I warned Sakura so we can keep unrelated people away from here, but it seems it'll be harder to get her out now."
"You were warning her? I thought you were tormenting her."

"Hey! Did you say something!?"
"Just an honest opinion. Anyways, about Sakura. What should we do? I don't think she'll go home now.
...I'll make it clear now. I won't allow Sakura to get involved."

"We'll just have to do something. So, does Sakura only come in the mornings? Or are you using her during the evenings too?"
"Don't word it to be misinterpreted. She always comes in the mornings, but not so much for dinner."

"I see. Then it would be every day from now on."
"Huh? Every day? What is?"
Tohsaka sighs at my response.

After that.
Tohsaka remains in the living room and Sakura begins to prepare breakfast in the kitchen.
I feel uneasy about leaving Sakura and Tohsaka together in the living room, but I'm not stupid enough to forget about Saber.

It seems Sakura is angry about Tohsaka being here, so things will only get worse if Saber comes out now.
Because of that, I decide to explain the situation to Saber.

"...So, that's the situation.
Sakuraoh, the person here right now is called Sakura. She's not a magus and she's just a normal girl, so we can't have her involved in the Holy Grail War. If I can help it, I want her to stay away from this place without learning anything"
No, I didn't come here to consult her on how to get Sakura away from here!

"Well, Sakura is acting strangely this morning.
Tohsaka is the reason, but I don't want to shock her even more. Well, Sakura is already surprised that a stranger's here. I think it will get worse if you come out, so... wait, I'm not insulting you, am I, Saber...?"

"No, I understand what you are saying. So I should remain here, yes?"
"! Yes, that would really help! I'll come back as soon as I see Sakura out, so let's have breakfast then."
Saber nods silently.
Wow, thank God Saber is so understanding.

All right.
I'm worried about the living room too, so I should hurry back there.
"Shirou."
"What is it, Saber?"

"You do not need to explain such things to me, but you should calm down a bit. Your actions are a bit strange."
"Huham I panicking?"

"Yes. If you are to return to the living room, you should calm down beforehand."
Saber advises me in her usual tone.
So.
The everyday breakfast begins as if nothing has happened.

"Here you go, Senpai. How about you, Tohsaka-Senpai?"
Sakura is handing out the rice bowls, just like her usual self.
I don't know what happened while I was gone, but the tension between the two has disappeared.
Well, at least on the surface.

"...Okay. I'll have some."
After pondering for a moment, she takes the bowl from Sakura.
Sakura smiles and starts to set up the miso soup and other things like the fried eggs.
Tohsaka watches her with a complex expression.

"Tohsaka. I thought you weren't one to eat breakfast?"
"I'll eat whatever's prepared. That's only polite, you know."
I don't know what's bothering her, but she glares at me and picks up her chopsticks.

"...Well, I guess it's good for you. Itadakimasu. And sorry to make you prepare breakfast, Sakura."
"No, this is my job, so please don't worry about it. Then I'll have some too."

"What a wonderful position you are in. What kind of king are you, making your junior prepare your breakfast? Well, I'll ask about that later and just eat breakfast for now."




Gah. No conversation.


It's not that terrible a mood, and anyway, it's always like this during breakfast.
Sakura and I aren't talkative, so it's natural for our meals to be quiet.
So, why is it that our breakfasts are always loud?

"...?"
Hold on.
Something's clicking in my head......

"Senpai? Um, was the fish seasoned too strongly...?"
"No, it's fine. But I feel like I'm forgetting something."

What is it?
I try to conclude that if I can't remember it, it can't be important. But I feel like that would be a terrible mistake.
I feel uneasy, as if I'm ignoring a disease that could kill me if left untreated.

"Oh well. It probably isn't important."
I forcefully make myself understand.
And then...
"Morning. Man, I slept in."
Fuji-Nee enters with loud footsteps.


I see.
It's not that I couldn't remember.
I just wanted to postpone the problem by forgetting about it.

"Shirou, food."
Fuji-Nee sits Japanese-style in her usual seat.
The two's greetings are in strange unison.

"Here you go, Sensei. It's not much, but please have some."
Sakura gives her a bowl with her usual smile.

"Mm?"
She receives the bowl from Sakura and tilts her head.
She knows something is wrong, but she can't tell what it is.
Fuji-Nee quietly starts to eat.
And after finishing one bowl of rice, she quietly whispers in my ear.

"...Hey, Shirou. Why is Tohsaka-san here?"
"That's because she's staying here now."
I explain things to her truthfully.

"Oh, I see. Tohsaka-san sure does some strange things."
"Yeah, she's a weirdo. She keeps a mask on at school."

"I see, so she's staying here, huh?"
She understands and takes a sip of her miso soup.

"WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'STAYING HERE', SHIROU!!!!?"

The table is thrown up.
Fortunately, Sakura is on the other side and Tohsaka has already moved out of the way, so it seems I'm the only victim.

"Ahhhhh! W-W-W-W-What are you doing, Fuji-Nee!? This is miso soup, cooked rice, and food cooked in pot! It'll be hot if you spill that on mehey, why are we having food in a pot for breakfast anyway...!?"

"Shut up! What are you thinking, Shirou!? What kind of love-comedy are you in, letting a girl stay over? No, it's not even funny!"

"I'm not trying to make anyone laugh...! No, more importantly, this is hot! I'll get burned! Sakura, get me a towel!"
"Here you go. I've prepared a cold towel, Senpai."
"Thanks...! Whoa, a piece of chicken fell in my shirt, and a hot one too!?"

"The towel comes later. Listen up, Shirou. Are you saying this seriously!?"
"Of course. You know I'm not one to joke like this.
Anyways, I'm letting Tohsaka stay here. I'll listen to complaints, but I won't change my mind."

"I object! I don't know what you're up to, but I can't allow it! Onee-chan won't allow you to live with a girl your age!"
Fuji-Nee roars.

...Well, I guessed it.
Fuji-Nee is my guardian and a school teacher.
I don't think I can escape such a situation with merely a hundred beatings from the shinai, or even from a real sword.
But I guess you could say it's ill fortune that I have to push through with this.

"You have to. I don't have any bad intentions, and we're not like that. I could just say we got into an accident, and I ended up letting her use a room here as a result."

"SHUT UP! I CAN'T ALLOW IT!!!!
I won't allow her to stay here! I don't know Tohsaka-san's circumstances, but make her go home at once!"
Damn, she won't even listen.
Crap, I guess she isn't someone I can convince...!

"Sensei. You say you would not allow me to stay here, but I have already spent a night here."
And then.
Tohsaka says those words, like pouring cold water on Fuji-Nee.

"Huh?"
"I said, I was allowed to stay here yesterday.
No, I stayed here from Saturday evening, so I have stayed here for two nights, to be accurate. I have borrowed the room in the outbuilding, and my luggage is already there.
How about it, Sensei? Looking at things objectively, it seems that I am already staying here."


Fuji-Nee's face goes pale.

"S-S-Shirou, what have you done...!? Do you know what would happen if Kiritsugu-san found out about this!?"
"I bet he'd be happy. He'd say something about a man's resourcefulness or whatnot."

"Ugh... I feel the same way. Kiritsugu-san was really indulgent with girls... I see, so you inherited that, you idiot!"
Fuji-Nee grabs my collar and shakes me around.
...Well, the inheritance aside, it was Father's belief that girls should be protected.
I don't go around telling people that like Father did, but I do believe he was right.

But...
"What? Do you need help?"
I think a man would have to be tough to recognize that cold-hearted person as a girl.

"...Please. I can't do anything about the situation. I have high expectations of your political skills."
I say, while being shaken.
"Okay. Then I'll settle this immediately."
Tohsaka, who was only watching from a distance, comes to stand directly beside Fuji-Nee.

"Fujimura-Sensei. Only screams will come out of Emiya-kun even if you shake him, so please stop. Well, breakfast might come out too."
"Hmph... what, that serious face doesn't scare me, Tohsaka-san. As a teacher and as Shirou's guardian, I can't allow you to stay."

Fuji-Nee lets go of me and confronts Tohsaka.
It must be her natural instincts.
She must have thought Tohsaka would get her if she kept concentrating on me.

"Why is that? There are many students that are boarding at our school. Is it not our school policy to encourage the students' independence?"

"What, even if you use difficult words, you still can't stay. You can't get independence from staying in a place like this.
This place is a dream house. It prepares meals for you, prepares baths for you, and is always clean without you doing anything. You'll be corrupted if you stay in a place like this."
"...Fuji-Nee."
That statement is problematic, coming from a teacher.

"And as a rule, only students living far away can board at someone's house. Tohsaka-san's house is farther from school than here, but it's not like you can't go to school from there, right? Even Sakura-chan commutes from that area, so there's no need to stay here."

"But my house is undergoing complete remodeling right now.
It is an old building, so it's getting a bit unsteady. I was thinking of staying at a hotel until the remodeling is done, but when I explained the situation to Emiya-kun as he happened to pass by, he said I could use his house rather than waste money."

"Hm... that does sound like something Shirou would say."
"Yes. I was surprised by the idea coming from Emiya-kun, with whom I am not too well acquainted. But staying at a hotel is indeed costly, and most of all, unstudent-like. So I thought it would be more beneficial for me to stay at Emiya-kun's house instead."

"Hm... Hmmmm."
Fuji-Nee groans.
Since Tohsaka's answer and attitude are so student-like, it seems that as a teacher supposedly, Fuji-Nee cannot object.

"I understand your situation. But isn't there a problem? You are a girl and Shirou is a boy, so I don't know what could happen if the two of you stay under one roof."
"What do you mean by that, Sensei?"

"Uh... um, well, Tohsaka-san is pretty, and Shirou is a guy, so I thought I wouldn't like it if a mistake got made..."
"There won't be any. My room is on the edge of the outbuilding, and Emiya-kun's room is the room by the shed. It's more than thirty meters away. I believe there won't be any problems with this much distance between us."

"Y-Yeah, the outbuilding can be locked, so it's like a separate house, but..."

"Right? Or are you saying you don't trust Emiya-kun? You said earlier that you are Shirou's teacher. Then, I believe you know his personality better than I do. If he was the type to make that sort of mistake, I would not stay here."

"How dare you, Shirou is a gentleman! He wouldn't make a girl cry!"
"Then it should be fine. I trust Emiya-kun too. I knew I could stay here safely."
"Hmmmmmm."

The intensity in Fuji-Nee disappears.
...I guess it's decided now.
There are lots of things to follow up, but I bet Tohsaka can get through those.
So I guess Tohsaka officially has citizenship in my house now....

And so breakfast ends.
As expected, Fuji-Nee gave in after being talked down by Tohsaka.
In conclusion, we decided to try to keep it a secret at school, and to have Fuji-Nee look after us at home.
With that decided and with more people around the house, Fuji-Nee happily goes to school.

We finish breakfast, and I go to talk to Saber before I leave.
Saber, as expected, calmly says,"Please obey Rin at school.
Please consider me necessary when you are in danger. That will allow me to feel Master's danger."
And she goes back to her room.
And it's time to go to school.

"Let's go, then. I'm not used to this area, so show me the shortest way to school."
Beside me is Tohsaka Rin in her school uniform.

...The feeling is fading, but having Tohsaka in her uniform makes me tense.
I can't stay calm going to school with the prettiest girl in school, and on top of that...

"Senpai. I finished locking up the house."
Sakura is with us today.
As a member of the archery club, Sakura usually goes to school with Fuji-Nee.
But she stayed in the living room today, and was waiting for me to clean up after breakfast and go to school.

"What? You gave Sakura a spare key?"
"Yeah. She won't do anything bad, and she's been helping me for a long time too... yeah, when I put it like that, I can't really give you a key. You won't mind, right?"

"...I don't mind, but what is that supposed to mean?"
"Because you would do something bad. And I bet you won't have any problems without the key. I'm not crazy enough to do anything unnecessary."

"Oh, I see. Yes, as you say, I have no need of such a thing!"
Tohsaka looks away.

Maybe I'm just getting used to it, but I'm starting to think this gesture of Tohsaka's is interesting too.

"......"
"Hm? What, Sakura? If you're done locking up the house, let's go.
Tohsaka is with us today, so I want to leave early."
"Yes, you're right. If you say so, I will."

Sakura says so in a dispirited voice and follows after us.
...Geez.
Sakura has looked somewhat cheerless ever since Fuji-Nee lost to Tohsaka this morning.
Fuji-Nee assented, but Sakura must not have.

"...I guess I'll have to talk to her about it..."
That's right. I'll need to find an opportunity as quickly as I can, and make Tohsaka and Sakura be friends

The hill road is full of students.
It's past seven thirty in the morning. This is the time most students go to school.
So...
It's natural for me to be met with odd stares if I'm walking with people who stand out so much.

"......"
Did she forget something?
Tohsaka has been quiet like this for a while now.

"What's wrong, Tohsaka? You've been acting weird since around the road on the hill."
"Huh...? I thought so, am I weird?"

"No, you're not weird, but that reaction is weird."
"Senpai, that explanation is contradictory. I don't think Tohsaka-Senpai is asking about that..."
It seems Sakura knows what Tohsaka wants to ask about.

"Hm? What does Tohsaka want to ask about?"
"Everyone is staring at Tohsaka-Senpai, so she thinks there might be something wrong with her. Isn't that right?"

"T-That's right, but am I acting weird to your eyes as well?
That's strange. I was tired, but I did my hair and there shouldn't be any wrinkles on my uniform. ...I slept in a new place, so do I have dark circles around my eyes!?"

"What are you yelling at me for?
It's not my fault if you can't sleep in an unfamiliar place, and even if you do get dark circles, they're nothing much. Don't worry about it."

"How dare you! Girls care about their looks from the moment they're born.
Geez, I've always tried hard to look perfect at least on the outside, but I guess that came to an end today...!"

"So, what are you yelling at me for?
I don't know why you're weird, but it's definitely not my fault. Take it out on something else."

"You're mistaken, Tohsaka-Senpai. You're beautiful today as always.
Everybody is staring at you because you're with us today. You have never come to school with anyone else before."

"Huh...? So I'm getting this treatment because of something so small? ...I should be more careful. I thought I had this school thing mastered since I've been here for ten years now, but there are still some mysteries to it."

Tohsaka ponders seriously.
What kind of a person are you just to ignore praise like "you're beautiful as always"?

"...I don't get you. Of course there'll be a commotion if you go to school with someone. All the more so if it's a male student."
"Right. But Tohsaka-Senpai isn't one to care about such matters. That's why there have never been any rumors about men."

"I see... that's good. That means that there's only one victim who got deceived by her looks and got devastated."
I talk secretly with Sakura while following Tohsaka, who has a puzzled expression.

We go through the gate, still with people staring at us.
We will be going our separate ways once we enter the building, so I only need to endure the stares for a bit longer.

"...Heh. A troublesome guy even shows up in the morning."
Tohsaka murmurs.
Before her is a familiar face, coming through the students.

"Sakura!"
"Uh... Nii-san."
Sakura trembles a little.
Shinji must not see us, as he goes straight to Sakura.

"Why didn't you come to the dojo!? What are you doing, skipping it without my consent!?"
Shinji raises his hand.
I...
"Yo, Shinji. Working hard in the mornings, huh?"
...Catch his hand and greet him.

"E-Emiya...!?"
YouI see, you went to Emiya's house again, Sakura!?"
"...Yes. I went to help Senpai. But, that's..."

"Your responsibility as a junior? You're so unrefined. You shouldn't care about a guy who hurt himself. Don't worry and just do as I say."

Shinji lowers his hand.
...I have no reason to hold his hand if he's not going to hit Sakura, so I let it go.

"But what about you, Emiya? Is it so much fun to trouble us? Sakura is a member of the archery club, so could you stop forcing her to do things that'll make her skip practice?"
"Hm."

I can't object against that.
Since I haven't stopped Sakura from coming to make breakfast, that does mean I'm restricting Sakura's time in the morning.

"That's not true...! I'm helping Senpai by my choice. Aren't you going a bit far, Nii-san?"

"Too far? That's you, Sakura. So what if Emiya doesn't have parents? He says he's fine alone, so you can leave him alone. Someone like Emiya would feel more comfortable that way."

"Nii-san...! ...That's terrible..."
"Heh, fine. Don't go to Emiya's house from now on. You didn't come to the club when I told you to. You were prepared for this kind of a punishment, right?"


Sakura gasps and freezes.
Shinji tries to grab Sakura forcefully

"Good morning, Matou-kun. Sorry for eavesdropping, but that was a pretty interesting conversation right there."
"HuhToh... saka? Why are you with Sakura?"

"It's nothing unusual.
Sakura-san is an acquaintance of Emiya-kun, and I'm an acquaintance of Emiya-kun, so we all came together this morning. Didn't you notice?"

"Whaa-an acquaintance of Emiya...!?"
"Yes. I know him well enough that we'll be coming to school and going home together from now on. So, I'm thinking of making friends with Sakura-san too."

"With Emiya...!!!!!?"
Shinji glares at me.
...I must be just imagining that I felt more than enmity there.
Well, I haven't been doing well with Shinji lately, but I don't remember doing anything to make him resent me that much.

"Ha, that's ridiculous. That's a bad joke, Tohsaka. There's no way you'd be with Emiya.
...Oh, I see. You must have a misunderstanding. It's true that I was friends with Emiya a while ago, but we're detached now. So there isn't much point in that approach, you know?"

"Is that so? I'm glad to hear that. I didn't have the slightest interest in you."

"Wow."
I pity Shinji.
If that was me, it would be traumatic enough that I wouldn't recover for a while.

"You."
"And, Matou-kun? About that conversation earlier. The morning practice of the archery club is open participation. I've never heard that you need permission to be absent. I'm sure Fujimura-Sensei and Ayako don't know of such a rule either."

"Uhshut up! An older brother can do whatever he likes with his sister! Don't poke your nose into our family affairs!"
"Yes, I feel the same way. So isn't it wrong for you to say such things about Emiya-kun's household? Geez, you're rowdy so early in the day, Matou-kun."

"!"
Shinji takes a step back and glares at me and Sakura.

"All right, I'll forgive you for this morning.
But it won't happen again, Sakura. If something happens again, I'll make sure you understand your position."
Saying what he wants, Shinji runs away to the school building.
Yeah. He definitely ran away after losing to Tohsaka.

"...I'm sorry, Senpai. Nii-san, um... was rather rude."
Sakura lowers her head apologetically.
She must be apologizing to Tohsaka as well.

"No, it was good exercise. My mind went up a gear, so I'm finally up to par now. I love arguments."

"And I should be the one apologizing. I think I did a bit too much. He has his position to think of, so I shouldn't have done that in front of everybody, you know?
If Matou-kun is feeling down, cheer him up.
Tell him he doesn't have to learn from experience, and that he can come at me again."

"Ahyes. If he doesn't learn from experience, please talk to him again, Senpai."
Sakura must be relieved, as she smiles cheerfully.
Tohsaka is looking away, bashful.

"You too, Senpai. Um, please try not to get mad about it.
You're the only friend Nii-san has."
"I know. It's impossible not to get mad, but I knew he was that kind of a guy as soon as I got to know him.
Well, I know we'll get to know each other better someday, so I'll be patient with him."

"Yesplease give him your best regards, Senpai."
Sakura bows.
...Yeah.
If I do get really mad at Shinji, it'll be because he's not satisfied with such a wonderful sister.

"Then, Senpai, let's do our best today."
Sakura goes to the first year hallway.

We walk up the stairs and enter the second-year hallway, and...
"Whoa!?"
...Run into the student council president.

"W-Why are you with Tohsaka, Emiya Shirou!?"
I see. You are full of enmity too, for a different reason.

"Oh, good morning, Ryudou-kun. What kind of a greeting is 'whoa' supposed to be?"
"Guh, I had a bad feeling when I woke up, but I never thought things would go in such an unpropitious direction! Ah, come here, Emiya! You'll be poisoned if you stay so close to Tohsaka!"

Issei forcefully pulls on my hand.
After looking silently at us, Tohsaka heads to Class 2-A as if nothing has happened.

"Heh, go ahead. No one's going to stop you."
"......"
Tohsaka silently passes by us.
And then...
"Shirou, rooftop during lunch."
She mutters that so Issei would not be able to hear it.

It's lunchtime.
Since the events of this morning, Issei has avoided me, treating me like a traitor.

"...I guess I joked around a bit too much."
I contemplate my actions for a moment.
He asked me why I was with Tohsaka this morning.
"We got close during the holidays."
Answering like that was bad.

I think the problem is how we became close, but I couldn't explain that, and Issei walked away dizzily.

"...Well, I guess it's fine. I'll have to do a lot of things alone for a while."
It's good to have less people involved.
Well, what I should do right now is

1) Go and meet Tohsaka as arranged.
2) Explain things to Sakura.
I have that promise with Tohsaka.
It was a unilateral statement, but she must have something to talk about if she called for me.

I buy my lunch and go to the rooftop.
It's usually packed with students, but not in this cold winter air.

Even though the winter in Fuyuki City is warm, the coldness at the rooftop is unbearable.
The only ones on the rooftop are me and...
"You're late! What are you so slow for?"
...Tohsaka, shivering under cover.

"I do feel bad for being late. Because of that, I brought you something, but you might not need it acting like that, huh?"
I take the coffee I bought at the stand and put it in my pocket.

"Ugh... you have a naive face, but you're pretty thoughtful."
"It's just a whim. Come over here.
It's windy out here and people might see us."

I pass Tohsaka and hand her the coffee.
Here, nobody should find us right away and we won't be seen from the windows on the fourth floor.

"Thanks. Get me some tea next time. I like milk teas. The value of the gratitude goes down if it's anything else, so be careful."
"All right, if I remember next time. So what, why did you get me up here? Seeing how you chose a desolate place, I'm assuming it's about that sort of thing."

"O-Of course. What else do we have to talk about?"
"Yeah, you're right. So, what's it about?"
"...What? You're pretty cool about it."

"Huh? Well, it's cold so I want to get this over with quickly.
Don't you feel the same?"
"! Of course! I plan to finish this business quickly too!"

Yeah, I thought so.
It's obvious, so she doesn't have to yell about it.

"Oh well.
Then, I'll ask you directly. What are you going to do after school?"
"After school? I don't have any plans. I'll help the student council if they need help. Otherwise, I'll just go to work."


"...What's with that utterly amazed expression? Tell me if you want to say something. I'll try to correct things."

"...Geez. I don't care what happens to you, but I guess I'll give you one warning. We're cooperating right now, and you're too inexperienced as a magus."
"That again? I've heard that I'm an inexperienced magus too many times. I know, so don't tease me about it."

"I'm not teasing you. I'm just saying you're inexperienced because you don't seem to have noticed the boundary field around this school."
"?"
Boundary field around the school......?

"Hold on. A boundary field at school, could that be..."
"It is a boundary field set up by another Master.
It's arranged so widely that it will pretty much encircle the whole school.

"This boundary field is the type that steals blood and meat from the humans inside it. It's still in the preparation phase, but haven't you noticed everyone's kind of listless?"


Come to think of it... I felt a bit strange on Saturday, but was that it?
Then that must mean

"Sothere's a Master at this school...?"
"Right. There's certainly an enemy lurking here. Do you understand, Emiya-kun? If you're not prepared, you'll die."


My relaxed feelings go tense.
"...So. Do you know who this Master is, Tohsaka?"

"No, I've got some ideas, but I don't have any proof yet. ...Well, I knew there was another magus in this school, but a magus doesn't necessarily equal a Master.
There are cases when an amateur like you becomes a Master, so I can't be sure."

"Hey. I'm not an amateur, I'm a proper magus. ...Hey, hold on Tohsaka. There's another magus at our school...!?"

"That's right. But I can't feel any sign that the magus is a Master. I went to check first, but they didn't have a Command Spell nor the presence of a Servant.
They might just be hiding it really well, but I'm pretty sure this person is not a Master."

"So I think the Master at this school is someone with an incomplete knowledge of magic like you.
Recently, I've felt a little magical energy other than ours in this place. That's a sign of the enemy Master's presence, but..."
But it's too small an amount to detect the source, huh?

"A Master that's not a magus, huh? If you say so, you must be confident of that.
I believe you, but really... are there that many magi at our school?"

"So many? Just this person and I.
A magus values their lineage, right? If two such lineages live in such a small area, they're bound to become intimate."

"Is that so? But I never knew about your family."

"Your household is special. I think your father was a lone wolf who alienated himself from the Association. He must have happened to like this city and decided to live in it, but this city is under our supervision.
If we found out, we'd take what we could, so I guess he was hiding because he didn't want that."

"WWhat do you mean, take what you could?"

"Hmm, are you curious? I'll come and collect it when you mature, so look forward to it."
"...Geez. You really were wearing a mask.
Just how are you an honor student, you imposter?"

"Oh, is that so wrong? It's the responsibility of a magus to decorate the outward appearance, is it not?
You see, I'm the successor of the Tohsaka family, so I have to be a perfect honor student or I won't be able to face my father in heaven."

"Huh? Father? Tohsaka, you mean..."
"Yes, he died when I was young. Well, he lived a long time, so I'm not sad or anything."


Tohsaka smiles, as if saying that's how a child with a magus father should be.
But that's...

"That's a lie. When people die, you're sad. All the more so if that person is a relative. It's not something you can gloss over by saying, he was a magus so it couldn't be helped."
"............Well, yeah.
You're completely right, so I can't argue."

Saying that, Tohsaka opens the can she's been using as a heat source.
...She takes small sips of the coffee.
From what I know of her, I thought she would gulp it down, but she's really feminine when it comes to things like this.

"Let's get back to the topic.
Anyways, there are only two magi in Fuyuki.
Other Masters must have come from elsewhere, or been a weirdo that got selected because they know a bit of magic."

I see.
According to Tohsaka, I'm weird too.

"I understand. But if it's a Master who barely knows magic, wouldn't it be impossible for him to create such a boundary field?"

"Maybe the Master didn't create it, but the Servant did.
Servants can't choose their Master. If a Servant ends up with a Master like you, they'll only be able to win if they do a lot of planning."

"...Yeah. As annoying as it is, I can't argue with that."

"Good, you're honest.
So, getting back to the boundary field... this boundary field is really advanced.
It's almost at the level of sorcery. If a magus can create such a boundary field, it should be impossible for them to hide their magical energy. So I believe this must be the actions of a Servant."

"...The actions of a Servant, huh? Then is the Master not that dangerous?"

"Of course not. Magus or not, he's a strange one who doesn't know the rules. He's the type that will come and kill you if he finds out you're a Master."

"Huh? Not know the rules? You mean, the rules of the Holy Grail War?"
"No. The rules of humanity. The moment they make their Servant create a boundary field like this, they've lost track of who they are.

"Look, Shirou. Once this boundary field is finished and activated, it will melt every human in it and absorb them.
It's like we're in the stomach of something alive.
...Well, it shouldn't have any effect on people like us who protect ourselves with magical energy, but those without magical energy will weaken and die without knowing why.

"It's not just a matter of dragging ordinary people into this mess.
Once this boundary field is activated, everyone in this school will die. Do you understand? A Master at this school is absurd enough to prepare something like this."


My vision blurs for a bit.
Trying to comprehend what Tohsaka is saying, I take a deep breath.

That's it.
Even though my understanding is incomplete, I imagine the worst possibility and engrave that image inside me, accepting the situation I am in.

"I get it.
So, Tohsaka. Can you destroy this boundary field?"

"I tried, but it was useless. I found all the sources of the boundary field, but I can't destroy it. All I can do is to weaken the source temporarily and delay the activation."

"Hm... so the boundary field won't be activated as long as you're here?"

"...That'd be nice, but that's only optimism. The boundary field is already set up and the magical energy for activation is gathering bit by bit. According to Archer, it should be ready in about eight days."

"When that happens, this school will fall into hell as soon as the Master or the Servant puts their mind to it."
"Then before that happens..."

"We have to defeat the Master lurking at this school.
But finding the Master will be difficult. The guy pretty much won as soon as he set up the boundary field. The boundary field will be activated even if he does nothing, so he won't appear until then. So if there is a chance..."

"...It'll only be when he emerges?"
"Exactly. So you should stay quiet for now. You will have to fight when the time comes, so it's just stupid for you to go out searching and have the enemy find you before that."

The first bell echoes through the cold rooftop.
Lunch break is over.

"That's it. I have to go somewhere, so go home by yourself. Try not to go anywhere on your way home."
Tohsaka leaves, saying "see ya".


There's no way I am feeling good.
There's no way I can have a calm mind, after finding out that the talk of Masters only attacking other Masters was pointless.

"A boundary field at school?"
Is he planning to drag innocent people into this?
That's not the work of a Master at all, but a mass-murderer.
I have to find him before the boundary field is activated, find him anddefeat him completely.

'Rejoice, Emiya Shirou. Your wish-'
"!"
I shake my head and deny the words I remember.
I can't wish for something like that.
A wish for a villain to defeat, that's not my wish

The end of school homeroom ends, and students start to disappear from the classroom.
I would normally go to the student council room, but since Tohsaka told me to go straight home, I should do so.
...That's right.
Things were busy this morning, so I should go and explain to Sakura now.

I arrive at the fourth floor, the first year hallway.
When I look into the classroom from the hallway, Sakura notices me right away.

"Um, is there something wrong, Senpai?"
She tilts her head in question as soon as she comes out.
I thought she would be depressed after what happened with Shinji, but she seems okay.

"No, nothing happened. I just want you to forgive me for that thing with Tohsaka. I couldn't talk to you about it this morning, so I want to apologize before I went home."
"...? Um, what thing with Tohsaka-Senpai should I forgive you for?"

"Well, her staying at my place for a while.
I should have consulted you beforehand, so I'm sorry for making the decision on my own.
But, there is a reason for her staying, and there aren't any bad intentions. Um, you might not forgive me, but I just wanted to say that."
I lower my head to apologize.

"D-Don't do that, Senpai! You have nothing to apologize for.

"...I was certainly surprised that Tohsaka-Senpai was staying over, but Fujimura-Sensei approved of it, so I don't think there's any problem.
That house is your house, so you can do as you wish with it, and it's not my place to say anything about it."

"Idiot, what are you saying, Sakura? That house is mine, Fuji-Nee's, and yours. It's not something I can just selfishly decide about."
"EhSenpai?"

"So it's only natural for me to apologize. You should be mad at me, not at Tohsaka. ...Um, since I'm the one who invited Tohsaka without asking my family.
About her staying over, I'll stop it if you don't want it. That doesn't make it forgivable, but I can't keep on doing something you don't like."

They're not words to smooth things over, but I say them from the bottom of my heart.
Cooperating with Tohsaka doesn't necessarily mean living with her.
There should be other ways to cooperate efficiently with her.

"Um, then I'll forgive you. I'll approve Tohsaka-Senpai's stay, and I'll forgive you for your selfishness.
Is that okay, Senpai?"
"Huh... is that all right, Sakura...?"

"Yes. I won't ask what kind of circumstances you're in. It's enough for me to have you say that."

Sakura is looking straight at me and smiling.
There's no dishonesty in her expression.
Sakura is approving Tohsaka's stay from the bottom of her heart.

"Thanks, Sakura. Um, I'm really glad."
"No, I'm the one that's really glad.
Uh, but Senpai... Just hypothetically, but what would you do if I said I didn't want it?"

"Hm? Well, I guess maybe I would have gone to her instead. I have to be with Tohsaka for a while."
"Huh... Senpai goes instead, um... to..."

"Yeah, instead of having Tohsaka over, I think I would have stayed at Tohsaka's place. That way, I wouldn't bother Fuji-Nee or Sakura."

It's too terrifying to think about staying over with a girl I admire... no, admired. But there're no other options.

"...But, thanks. If that happened, I think she would tease me even more."
Thank God.
I'm so happy Sakura forgave me... huh?

"Sakura? What's wrong? You look pale."
I call out to her, wondering if she's all right.
Sakura seems to be deep in thought,"T-Thank God I didn't say that"
And she lets out a sigh that I don't quite understand.

So, it's after school.
While the bell is ringing to send the students home, I pack my bag along with everyone else.
I should head straight back because Saber is waiting at home.

There are students scattered in the hallway.
There are different kinds of students: some going to their club activities,some staying behind to kill time,and one ten meters away, charging at me with an angry face.

"...?"
I think there's something strange mixed into that expression, so I turn and head to the stairs quickly.

"Oh yeah.
I suddenly remember, but I was told something this morning."
I was told something, but now, I'll go through with pretending that I forgot.
No, I won't be able to explain if I do that, so let's say I didn't hear it or something...

"Hold on there. You're quite brave, running away after seeing someone's face."

"Ugh."
I'm caught, as I expected.
Well, even if I do go home, there's nowhere to run. It seems there'll be less damage if I'm caught here, so I stop.

"......"
I turn around slowly.
...Yeah, she's really pissed.
She's so angry, you'd never think she's the school's number one honor student.

"Hey. What a coincidence, Tohsaka. If you're going home, do you want to go home together?
We're heading the sa"

"Not 'let's go home', you idiot...! Do you understand the situation you're in!? I was going to warn you, so why didn't you come to the rooftop!?"

"Ugh."
This threatening attitude.
It seems she won't listen to any excuses, but I bet she won't calm down unless I make some excuse.

"...Sorry. I was with Sakura during lunch, so I couldn't go to the rooftop."
She doesn't seem too calm, so I tell her honestly.

...And then.
Tohsaka looks at me in blank amazement, as if she's seen a ghost.

"With Sakura... you mean, talking about me staying at your place?"
"Yeah. It was unclear this morning, so I had her approve of your stay."

"............[r]
...I see. Well, I guess it can't be helped in that case."

"...?"
Tohsaka quickly gets rid of her anger, and for some reason,[r]
"All right, I'll forget about what happened during lunch. I'm sorry Sakura caused you trouble."
And she apologizes with a gentle expression.

"Uhno, there's no need for you to apologize, but...
W-What was it you called me to the rooftop for? It was something important, right?"

"Y-Yeah. I called for you because I had something to tell you as a Master. I wanted to warn you to be careful, since there's a boundary field set up at the school"

"Huh...? H-Hold on. Boundary field... you mean, at this school...!?"

"Yeah, it seems you haven't noticed, but there's a troublesome one set here.
The sign is constructed with a wide range, so once it is activated, it will pretty much encircle the whole school.
This boundary field is the type that steals blood and meat from the humans inside it. It's still in the preparation phase, but haven't you noticed everyone's kind of listless?"

"Ah"
Come to think of it... I felt a bit strange on Saturday, but was that it?
Then that must mean

"Sothere's a Master at this school...?"
"Right. There's certainly an enemy lurking here. Do you understand, Emiya-kun? I don't think he'll attack us at school, but I wanted to tell you to be on alert, so you'd be ready even if you're attacked."


My relaxed feelings go tense.
...No wonder Tohsaka got so angry.
I didn't even know about it and spent the day peacefully.

"...Sorry. I was at fault at lunch, Tohsaka."

"Well. Saber entrusted you to me, so if it had been a stupid reason, I would have cast geas on you.
But I'll let it pass this time. Nothing happened today, even if it's just how things turned out."

All's well that ends well, huh?
I feel a bit better if she says so.

"...So. Do you know who the Master that set this boundary field is, Tohsaka? ...Is it someone from this school?"

"No, I don't know that yet.
...I don't feel any magus-like presence here other than me, so it might be an outsider, but there are cases when an amateur like you becomes a Master, right?
So I can't be sure. ...Well, it's most likely that it's the doing of someone from this school.
It needs to be someone that wouldn't look suspicious here, since they had to set up a boundary field at the school."


...Someone who wouldn't be seen as suspicious even on school grounds.
Student or teacher, either way, a Master other than ourselves is lurking here.

"That's not the only problem.
Shirou. Once this boundary field is finished and activated, it will melt every human in it and absorb them. It's like we're in the stomach of something alive.

"...Well, it shouldn't have any effect on people like us who protect ourselves with magical energy, but those without magical energy will weaken and die without knowing why.
It's not just a matter of dragging ordinary people into this mess.
Once this boundary field is activated, everyone in this school will die.
Do you understand? A Master at this school is absurd enough to prepare something like this."


My vision blurs for a bit.
Trying to comprehend what Tohsaka is saying, I take a deep breath.

That's it.
Even though my understanding is incomplete, I imagine the worst possibility and engrave that image inside me, accepting the situation I am in.

"I get it.
So, Tohsaka. Can you destroy that boundary field?"

"I tried, but it was useless.
I found all the sources for the boundary field, but I can't destroy it. All I can do is to weaken the source temporarily and delay the activation."

"Delay the activation...? So the boundary field will not be activated as long as you're here?"

"...That'd be nice, but that's only optimism.
The boundary field is already set up and the magical energy for activation is gathering bit by bit. According to Archer, it should be ready in about eight days.
When that happens, this school will fall into hell as soon as the Master or the Servant puts their mind to it."

"Then before that happens..."

"We have to defeat the Master lurking at this school.

"...It'll only be when he emerges?"
"Exactly. So you should stay quiet for now. You will have to fight when the time comes, so it's just stupid for you to go out searching and have the enemy find you before that."

...I get it.
I can't forgive a guy who would set up such a field, but it might have the opposite effect if I just go randomly searching now, since I don't know the Master's identity.

"That's all. I've done everything I can to deal with the boundary field today, so the rest comes tomorrow.
There's nothing left to do in the building now, so you go home ahead."
"...? I'm fine with that, but what are you going to do?"

"Don't worry about me. You're making Saber wait, so she'll get mad if you don't hurry."
"Geez..."

That's right.
Saber was against me going to school, so I had her approve of my independent action on the condition that I go home before the sun goes down.

"Then I'll see you later. Go straight home."
Maybe she has something to do at the gym, as Tohsaka heads to the back of the school.
I see her off for a while, and leave the school building after that.
The gate is still locked.
"...Oh yeah, it's been a while since I came home this early."
I usually help someone out or go to work, so it's rare for me to come straight home.

Usually, the gate would be open and Sakura would be preparing dinner inside when I got home.
Maybe I've grown so accustomed to it after a year that I've forgot how important it was.
I realize how grateful I am for Sakura, just by the simple action of opening a locked gate.

"I'm home."
I call out and step into the hallway.
As I try to enter the living room, the blond-haired girl appears.

"You are back, Master."
The girl looks straight at me.


For a moment.
All sense of reality crumbles on me.

"Shirou? Did you not just return home?"
Perhaps the surprise transferred to the girl, as she says this with a bit of surprise.
She calls my name in a quiet voice.
That finally returns my sense of reality.

"Oh... i-it's Saber, right? Sorry, it was so sudden, I was surprised."
Just for an instant, I mistook her for a normal girl.

"...? I was on standby here as Master ordered, but was I wrong?"
"Uh... no, I was misunderstanding, so don't worry about it.
A-Anyway, how are you feeling? You said you'd be sleeping frequently, so, um..."

"There is no problem with staying awake.
No, it is better to sleep except at times of battle, but that would cause my senses to dull.
I should move around periodically, or my body will be slow when I will need it the most."

"...I see. You're right now that you mention it. Humans get headaches from sleeping too much, and it's not like you're sleeping because you're sleepy."

"Yes. There is no fatigue to require sleep.
But Shirou, do you get a headache when you sleep too much?"

"Of course. Usually, you'll get sick if you sleep for half a day. In my case, I'll wake up from the headache, so I won't be able to sleep for half a day."

"...That is a strange story. It does not happen to me. I can sleep as much as I want, now and in the past."

"Hm. I think that's wrong for a living thing, Saber. It's a waste to sleep all day. It's more fun to wake up and play when you're not sleepy."

"...You are right. Less time is wasted that way."
"Right? You're like that now because of me, but go back to your normal cycle when your bond with me ends.
It's not for me to say, but if this becomes a habit and you sleep all day, people might think of you as lazy."

"It may be too late. People might have thought so of me already."

She creases her brow and ponders.
...It was just light-hearted, but it seems like Saber doesn't get normal jokes.

We move into the living room.
It seems Saber wants to know what happened today, so I decide to tell her about the boundary field at school that Tohsaka told me about.

"...I see. That Master must be planning to use the people gathered at the school as a sacrifice."
"Frankly, yes. Tohsaka said it should take more time, though."

"I feel the same way. It will take time to construct such a large-scale boundary field. The school is a building that can be easily locked up, so it must be an altar chosen as a temple.
To completely activate a boundary field of that scale, at least ten days are needed."

"Ten days... I felt something strange two days ago on Saturday, so that means we still have about eight more days. That's the same as Tohsaka's estimate..."

"Yes. It does not matter if that boundary field is to gather sacrifices or to solidify the defenses, as it will be a problem if we allow it to be completed. I hope we will be able to find the Master that created this boundary field before that..."

"Yeah. Tohsaka said it would be difficult, but he should be easy to identify since the Master will be lurking at school. Let's find him somehow and stop the boundary field."

The instant they think of setting up a boundary field at school, they must be someone associated with the school.
A student or a teacher.
I'll try to search the school as thoroughly as possible during lunch from tomorrow on and try to find anyone suspicious.

"And... yeah, the problem of which Servant that Master has."
No, that'll only be clear when I actually encounter it.

Then, I should think about a Servant I have already encountered.
Saber is awake right now, so this would be a good time to ask.
All right then

1) About Lancer.
2) About Archer.
3) About Berserker.
That guy
I'll ask about the first Servant I encountered, Lancer.
Saber fought with him, and it seems like she realized who he was.

"Hey Saber. About Lancer... do you know who he is?"
"Huh? Lancer?"

"Yeah. You were saying something when you chased him out. About Ireland or something.
So I thought you might have discovered his identity."

"Oh, I see your point now. ...I'm surprised, I did not think you would be interested in knowing your enemy's true identity."
"I heard you have to know about them. ...But why do you look so happy about it, Saber?"

"Because you are showing the will to fight. We can come up with strategies against a Servant whose true identity we know. It is an appropriate battle tactic to first bring down the ones whose weaknesses are known."

"...Hm."
I have no intention of going out to fight someone who isn't attacking me, but it'd only end the conversation if I said that now.

"Anyways, Lancer's true identity. So I guess you know, Saber?"

"Yes. That red lance and those runic protections around his body, and on top of that, his abilities specialized in survival. There can be no mistake.
His true name is Cu Chulainn. He is the great hero of Ireland, wielder of the devil lance Gae Bolg."

"...Cu Chulainn...?"
It's a name I've never heard before.
...Well, I don't know much about Irish mythology, so I guess that's only natural.

"...So. Is he strong, this Cu Chulainn guy?"
"He is not famous in this country, so his existence is diminished, but he still has more than enough power.
His agility is second to none, and I believe his Noble Phantasm is the most suitable for this war."

"Noble Phantasm...? Oh, that lance. Come to think of it, his lance moved strangely at the end. Is that the Gae Bolg thing?"

"...Probably. There are many variations on Gae Bolg's legend.
They say it is a cursed lance thrown using the legs, a devil lance that grows a thousand thorns once it stabs its enemy..."
"...? Aren't those just completely different legends? Can you really call it a legendary weapon?"

"There is more. Many abilities of Gae Bolg are handed down in the legends, but in every one is the fact that it will always pierce the heart.
...I had thought it was the ability of the possessor rather than the power of the weapon, but it seems I was wrong.
The nature of the devil lance, Lancer's Gae Bolg, is to always pierce the heart."

"Oh"
That said, I can recall vividly.
That night...
The lance thrust at Saber's feet moved in an impossible fashion and went toward her heart.

"So, his lance is"
"Yes. It is a devil lance, guaranteed to strike the opponent's heart when used.
It must be bending space or changing the order of cause and effect.
Either way, it must be Lancer's skill and the curse of the lance itself. There is no weapon more efficient in hand-to-hand combat. It has no unnecessary aspects."

"No unnecessary aspects...? What do you mean by that?"

"Do you not understand? Lancer's lance cannot destroy a castle, but it is enough to kill one person.
Noble Phantasms require different amounts of magical energy depending on their scale.
A servant with a rank A Noble Phantasm will need great amount of magical energy to use it. Once it is used, time is needed to replenish the magical energy that is lost."

"But to kill one personno, one Servant, you do not need great power. If you can kill your opponent with one blow, there is no better result."
"...? So you mean, there's less cost for one arrow than for one cannonball?"

"Yes. But arrows would not hit a Servant. As a result, battling Servants end up firing cannons at each other, but"
"...Lancer's Gae Bolg is a lance that allows this arrow to hit, huh? Not only that, but it hits the heart where it will definitely take the opponent's life."

"That is correct. And on top of that, not much magical energy is needed to use it. With that amount of magical energy usage, there should be no need to replenish magical energy even if he uses it seven times.
That is why his devil lance is well-suited for this war.
A normal Servant must rest after fighting a few times, but Lancer is able to fight six battles in a row. ...Well, that is on the condition that each must be one on one."

"...Hm."
So he's a Servant who's not flashy, but can definitely win, huh?

"He seemed to be doing a lot of useless stuff, though. He was playing around with me as well."
"Right. It seems Lancer is an inconsistent person. He was heartless, but he also had a side that was difficult to hate."

I feel the same way, but we can't let our guard down.
He stabbed me through heart as if he was cutting grass.
Servants like Berserker and Lancer have no hesitation when it comes to using their weapons.
That guy
I'll ask about Tohsaka's Servant, Archer.
Saber beat him with one blow, but that was a surprise attack, and his strength is unknown.

"Hey Saber. About Archer... have you noticed anything about him?"

"Archer?
...No, I know no more than you do.
It seems I am superior in simple battle, but I have not experienced his abilities nor his Noble Phantasm.
He is not one to look lightly upon just because we have defeated him once."

"...I see. Well, it really was only an instant.
And, well..."
...Back then.
When Saber attacked him, there was something strange about that moment.

I guess you could say it was a surprise attack that wasn't.
I think that red knight sensed Saber's presence beforehand.
But he froze when he saw Saber and couldn't react to Saber's attack.

"...Hey, Saber. Do you think he knows you? I feel that he took your blow that time because he was surprised by you yourself, and not by the attack."

"I see. That is understandable.
As he is an archer, it is only natural for him to be inferior to me in hand-to-hand combat.
But still, he was too weak at that time.
I was guessing that he was not able to use his power due to some external factor"

"Right? And I've seen him fight Lancer. Archer didn't go on the offensive, but his defense was out of this world. For him to take your first blow, I can only assume there was something wrong with him."

"...Does that mean he went easy on me?"
She must be angry at him for going easy on her, rather than at being able to beat him easily, as she glares at an enemy who isn't here.

"Fine. After our collaboration with Rin is over, I will make him regret insulting me."
"...! Uh, well, I don't think he went easy on you on purpose, so I don't think there's any reason to hold a grudge..."
I find myself defending Archer.

"...? Are you saying you can forgive Archer's act? No, it rather seems like you are protecting him. ...I think it is unlikely, but would you have preferred Archer as your Servant...?"

"N-No way...! Frankly, I dislike him. I've never talked to him, but I could instinctively tell when I saw him from a distance that I wouldn't get along with him."

"That is good. It was needless worry. I am relieved, Shirou."
"...Geez. I'm the one that's surprised. But why are you relieved by such a thing? Is it that good for me to dislike Archer?"

"...You are right. It is certainly strange.
Oh, it is probably because of our compatibility. I am a Servant that specializes in hand-to-hand combat, and Archer specializes in ranged combat.
If you were compatible with Archer, that would mean you were not compatible with me. If that was the case, we could not fully utilize our powers."

Saber nods, concluding that it must be why she is relieved.
"...I see. I guess that's how it works..."
Anyways, there's no information on Archer.
We still don't know which hero he is nor what kind of Noble Phantasm he has.
That giant
I should ask about the Servant Berserker, who overwhelmed Saber.
According to Saber and Tohsaka, he should be the strongest in battle

"Saber, what would happen if you fought Berserker again? ...Um, will you be unable to win as long as I'm your Master...?"
The greatest burden for Saber.
I ask her about the weakness that prevents her from using her powers at their full potential, just because she made a contract with an immature Master like me.

"That is incorrect, Shirou.
Even if you were a mature Master, it would make no difference to the fact that Berserker is a powerful opponent. You do not need to condemn your own inexperience for this fact."

"...Hm. That might be true, but it's a burden on you, right?
So, if you were the original Saber..."

"No. Even if I was at my full potential, it would be difficult to defeat Berserker. ...No, it may be impossible for any Servant to beat that giant.

"Shirou, do you remember the battle that night? Berserker repelled Rin's magic as if it was nothing. He does not have magic resistance like I do.
He just nullified the magic with his own physical strength."

"Hmm... I saw that, but is it something to be that surprised about?
That just means Berserker's body is tough, right?"

"No. Berserker did not endure Rin's magic, but he repelled it. The difference is substantial.
If one endures an attack, the armor will break if that spot is attacked repeatedly. But it is different if it is repelled. Rin's magic did not even reach Berserker to begin with."

"Didn't reach him...? You mean he nullifies magic like you do?"
"Yes. But like I said earlier, Berserker does not have the skill of magic resistance. If that is the case, I can only assume that his Noble Phantasm repelled the magic."

"...This is only a speculation, but Berserker's Noble Phantasm may be 'armor'. It is not a simple armor, and it could be close to a theoretical magical concept called a conceptual weapon.
PerhapsBerserker has an ability that nullifies all attacks that are below a certain level. That must be why my sword and Rin's magic were useless against him."

"If Berserker's true identity is the great hero of Greece, his abilities are mostly rank A. If we want to injure him, I believe we have to use an attack value that is at least of the same rank."

"...Attack value of the same rank...? So in other words..."
"...Yes. It is difficult to say, but I believe any attack that is below A rank will be nullified, whether normal attack or Noble Phantasm.
If we want to defeat that giant, we would need a normal attack power of at least an A rank, and a Noble Phantasm that exceeds even that."


I close my eyes and recall Saber's abilities.
Saber's strength... her normal attack power is B rank, and her Noble Phantasm is C rank.

...God.
If what Saber says is right, not only is it impossible to defeat Berserker, but we don't even have a way to hurt him...!

"H-Hold on...! Um, aren't strength and Noble Phantasms measured differently?
No matter how low the rank is, a Noble Phantasm is a powerful weapon, right? So if you measure it in terms of strength, shouldn't it be at least A rank?"

"Yes. Noble Phantasms are incomparable to normal attacks. A Noble Phantasm of a C rank, when converted to a normal ability, would have A or A+ rank.
...But the 'refusal' that protects Berserker goes beyond the rules of reality."

"That thing is a concept that can nullify even a Noble Phantasm that destroys the world, if it is below an A ranking.
Berserker... Hercules is a heroic spirit with divinity.
One can only affect a heroic spirit who has received the blood of gods with a divine mystery of the same level."

"Then, the next time we're attacked..."
...Will be our last?

"No. Whatever kind of a heroic spirit he is, a weakness must exist. At the very least, Berserker does not have an attack method on the anti-castle level. So we can avoid getting all of us killed in one blow, even if we are attacked.
When my wound heals, a matched one-on-one fight is possible. You could escape during that time, or I might be able to find a chance of victory if I have some form of backup."

"...So we need to stay away from them for now, huh? So, somehow we have to find Berserker's weakness by then...
So. Saber, what do you mean an attack method of an anti-castle level?"

"I am talking about the attack level of the Noble Phantasm.
Anti-personnel Noble Phantasms exhibit their true power in one-on-one combat.
Anti-army Noble Phantasms exhibit their power in group combat.
And the anti-castle Noble Phantasms decides everything in a single blow.
The Noble Phantasms largely fall into these three categories."

I see.
As the names suggest, anti-castle and anti-army, if we were attacked with such missile-like assaults, Tohsaka and I would be blown away in a single strike.
Fortunately, Berserker doesn't have an attack method that attacks such a wide range.

"...But the Master compensates that weakness.
Ilyasviel was a great mass of magical energy. If she is an excellent magus and concentrates on protecting Berserker... I will not be able to protect you."


...I see.
Berserker is not the only concern.
Master and Servant are one.
I am Saber's burden in that regard as well
"Then, about one of the others..."
"Hold on, Shirou. Someone has entered the gate of this place."

"Eh, you can sense such a thing...?
What, it's this time already!? Crap, Sakura's probably back!"
I quickly stand up.

I hear the sound of the doorbell from the entrance,"Excuse me."
I can hear Sakura's voice.

"Saber, I'm sorry, but..."
"I know. I will return to the room, so please do not be concerned about me."
Saber leaves for her room.

And in her place...
"I'm home. Well done, you came home early like I asked you to."
Tohsaka is holding a grocery bag and....
"Excuse me, Senpai. It's rare for you to be home this early."
Sakura comes in, smiling happily.

"All right, preparations are perfect. Then let's begin."
Tohsaka shouts and goes into the kitchen.
Sakura looks at her worriedly.
"Senpai...? Um, about dinner preparation..."

"Oh, it's Tohsaka's turn today, so you don't have to worry about it. You made breakfast today, so leave the dinner to us. We'll make dinner as long as Tohsaka is here."
"Oh... y-yes. If you say so, I will do that."
Sakura sits on a cushion obediently.
There is a flashy, fiery sound coming from the kitchen, but there's nothing dangerous-looking about Tohsaka's appearance from behind.

"...I guess it's okay to trust her..."
So there's no point in staying here.
There's Saber to think about, so I should go back to my room until dinner is prepared.

"I'm going to go rest in my room. If Fuji-Nee comes, tell her to prepare the bath herself once in a while."
"Ah, yes. Please take your time, Senpai. I will come and get you when dinner's ready."

"Yeah. ...Oh, don't forget to knock when you come to my room."
It's a little before six o'clock. From the way things are going, it looks like dinner will be at around seven o'clock.

When I get back to the room, Saber is asleep in the room next to mine.

"Man, I thought I could talk to her."
I click my tongue and sit on a cushion.
"...Hey, what am I saying? I don't even know what I'd talk to her about other than this Holy Grail War stuff."
Anyways, didn't I have trouble talking to Saber?

"Oh well. If she's asleep, it's fine."
I say that and just stare at the clock.
Yesterday's dinner was just me, Saber, and Tohsaka.
But today, it'll be five people, including Sakura and Fuji-Nee.

"...Oh, no... Saber can't come."
As long as Sakura and Fuji-Nee are there, I can't let Saber out of this room.
"I wonder if Saber ate breakfast."
Saber was nodding while eating dinner last night.
Judging from that, I guess it's not like she doesn't need food.

"...I didn't prepare lunch for her. Of course she'll be hungry."
Once Sakura and Fuji-Nee go home, I have to warm up dinner and serve it to her.
She'll need to eat alone, but that can't be helped

"......"
Hrm.
Imagining Saber eating by herself is really annoying me.

"Shirou, are you awake?"
Tohsaka knocks on the door and looks inside.

"Tohsaka? What's up?"
"Dinnertime. It's ready, so come along."
That time already, huh?
I get up and leave the room, glancing at the sleeping Saber.

"Oh, there you are. Hey, look at this stuff! Finally, with Tohsaka-san here, we have someone who can cook Chinese food!"
Fuji-Nee is looking excitedly at all the food prepared on the table.
Now that she mentions it, the food certainly is Chinese.

On the four big plates are crab with eggs, shredded beef with pepper, some stir-fry of an elegant looking meat I've never seen before with vegetables, and a plate full of steamed meat dumplings.

There are salads on the side plates, and various follow-ups are ready.
Put simply, it's the kind of gorgeous dinner Fuji-Nee loves.

"...I'm surprised. I was expecting you to make Western-style dishes."
"Oh, she was actually thinking of a Western-style dish, but when I told that her no one at our house cooks Chinese, she said she would."

"Why does she have to live her life poking at holes? ...? Hey Sakura, you came home with Tohsaka, so did you actually go shopping with her?"
"Yes. Tohsaka-Senpai was waiting for me when the archery club finished, so we went grocery shopping on our way back."

"...I see. Wow, you two are closer than I thought."
"Yes, we've talked often at school. I don't know why she likes me, but she has been nice to me ever since I entered the school."
Wow.
She really is a nice Senpai at school.

"Let's quit talking and eat. I'm hungry already."
Fuji-Nee sits down happily.
"Like she says. Why don't you two sit down too? Chinese food gets really bad when it gets cold."
Saying this coldly, Tohsaka sits down as well.


I sit down silently.
Everyone bows and eats the food.

"!"
Annoyingly, it's good.
I've never cooked Chinese because I thought "it all tastes the same", but this is so good it makes me realize it was just prejudice.

"Wow, this is great! It's been a while since I've had food that makes rice taste this good. Yeah, I'll give you top score on this one!"
"Thank you. I am pleased to receive an honest response like that."

"Yes. I have a better opinion of Chinese food now. I'm not good with hot food, but this is really good!"
Sakura is happily enjoying the food too.

After watching this with a smile,"Fufu."
Tohsaka Rin looks at me with an expression of triumph.

"What? You look like you want to say something."
"Noooothing. I'm just glad everyone's enjoying the food. Well, one isn't being honest, but that's fun in its own way, so I'll call it good. I understand what it feels like to lose at something you're good at."

"GuhI see, then you made me cook last night to gauge my potential!"
"Fufufufufu. Yes. Today's lesson is, always hide your potential."
She says this happily and starts eating her own food.
Dinner is more lively than I was expecting.
Sakura and Tohsaka are a good Senpai and junior, and Fuji-Nee is completely friends with Tohsaka now.


Well, I have no complaints about a fun meal.
No complaints, but I feel like there's something wrong with all of us eating right now.

"......"
I stand up.
"Huh? What, Shirou, going to the bathroom?"
"No, I forgot something. I'll bring her here, so wait."

When I leave the living room,Tohsaka is staring at me silently.

I just couldn't take it.
That's the only reason.
I don't like it when she's in the same house, but alone.

So, before considering the consequences, I grab her hand.

"S-Shirou!? What are you doing all of a sudden...!?"
"Just come with me. I'll introduce you to everyone."
"Are you insane!? Hold on, this is..."

"I'm taking you because I am sane. Here, let's go.
Whatever happens later can be dealt with."
"Hey, Shirou...!?"

I grab Saber's hand and take her to the living room.

"Sorry, Tohsaka. Can I add one more?"
Tohsaka doesn't object.
But Fuji-Nee and Sakura are looking at Saber with astonishment.

"It's a bit late, but let me introduce her.
Her name is Saber, and we're going to be taking care of her for a while. As you can tell, she's a foreigner and not used to living in Japan, so please help her with that."


There's no reaction from the two.
That's only natural, but I don't have enough composure to care about them right now.

"Here, sit here, Saber. It's better to eat with everyone."
"That is... certainly more efficient, but I..."
"Don't be reserved. After all, you're going to be living together with us from now on. Since we're living in the same house, it's natural to eat together."

"...Yes. If Shirou says so, I will obey."

"You can't d"
"YOU CAN'T DO THAAAAAAT!"
"...!!!!"
My ears!
My ears are ringing!

"What's wrong with you, Shirou!? You bring in not only Tohsaka-san, but a girl like this too? Since when did this place turn into a hotel!?"
"W-What? It'll be fine. It's as big as a hotel, so we can lend a room or two. If Tohsaka staying is fine, Saber should be fine too."

"No way! I approve of Tohsaka-san, but I don't know about this stranger! Who is she anyways!?"
"Whoshe's a distant relative of mine. She had some problems so she came here, counting on Father."

"I can't believe such a ridiculous story. Even if it were the case, why did she come to your house? There's no way Kiritsugu-san would have an acquaintance in another countr"
She can't really say that.
Because Father was a simpleton who went to foreign countries all the time, he would have more acquaintances overseas than in Japan.

"Well, I can't say that, but it's still strange. You, why did you come here?"
Fuji-Nee glares at Saber.

"Well, that's..."
"You be quiet, Shirou. Um, Saber-san? I'm asking you."

Saber is silent.
It's only natural. Saber doesn't have any reason to go along with my lies nor a dexterous enough mind, so she
"I do not know. I was only doing as Kiritsugu said."
Well, I guess she does.

"Hm. Kiritsugu-san entrusted Shirou to you?"
"Yes. He told me to defend Shirou from all enemies."
Quietly.
Saber says this with the greatest purity.

...Who could object to that?
Even if it's a lie, it's the ultimate truth for Saber herself.

"......"
Even Fuji-Nee can't object to those words.
But...

She stands up with a frown, glaring at Saber,"...All right. If you say so, I'll test your skill."
Fuji-Nee responds strangely.

So.
With a sound of wind, Fuji-Nee takes us outside.

"......"
She takes the shinai from the wall and glares at Saber.
...Well.
Just what is our Fuji-Nee thinking about?

"You. You said you'd protect Shirou, right? Then you must be confident in your skills."
"Are you telling me to take a sword?"

"Yes. I'll approve of you if you're stronger than me. But if you're weaker, I'm sending you back home."
"...I do not mind, but what is the purpose of this?"

"I'm the one that's gonna protect Shirou! I'm gonna be by his side until he grows up!"

It seems Saber doesn't understand what Fuji-Nee is trying to say.
Of course, no one else around here does either.

"Sooooo, I don't need anyone weaker than me!
If you're stronger than me, you'll be more dependable, right? If that's the case, I can entrust Shirou to you just for a bit."
Fuji-Nee plays with her shinai as if she's sulking.

"I understand. So I must earn your approval?"
"Right. But it's not going to be easy!"
Just as she says that, Fuji-Nee rushes at Saber and attacks her with the shinai...!

"Man, Fuji-Nee's being ridiculous!"
Not only was that a surprise attack, but she didn't even give Saber a shinai. Are you really a teacher, Tiger!?

"...?"
Saber must be surprised by Fuji-Nee's surprise attack as she just stands there distractedly.
Fuji-Nee's clever attack to the body strikes!

"Huh?"
Fuji-Nee tilts her head curiously.
...That's only natural.
It's strange even for those of us watching, so it must be as strange as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon for Fuji-Nee.


Saber is still standing.
The difference is, she is now holding the shinai Fuji-Nee was wielding until now.

"Uh... is this real?"
I don't know what's real, but it's certainly true.

Saber does not even take a stance.
Fuji-Nee doesn't move, standing before Saber.
Fuji-Nee is a kendo expert, said to be unmatched.
That experience must have made her realize that the person in front of her is on a completely different level.

"...If you want me to take a stance, I will. But you should be skilled enough to understand already."
"Uhh, hauuuu, hau..."
Fuji-Nee backs away unsteadily and drops to her knees.

"The contest is over. Do you approve of me?"
"Uh, guh..."
Fuji-Nee hangs her head and slumps her shoulders.
The very moment I think she'll calm down...

"UWAAAAAAAN!
"SOME STRANGER TOOK SHIROU AWAY...!"

She starts to cry so loudly that those around her get dizzy.

...In the end, it took two hours to persuade Fuji-Nee.
Fuji-Nee said "I want to talk a bit" and went into Father's room for two hours. When she came out, she nodded and said "I guess I have to approve of her", with an unhappy face.

On the other hand, Sakura is silent.
It was getting late, so Fuji-Nee ended up walking Sakura home, but Sakura said nothing and merely bowed and went home.

"Then I'll go back to the outbuilding."
...Oh.
Come to think of it, Tohsaka is like this too.

"...Sorry. I bet you think I did something stupid."
"Nope. But what you're doing is extra weight on your mind. If you keep doing such things, you'll end up being unable to move."

Saying good night with a wave, Tohsaka leaves.
"Sigh."
I'm tired.
I'll rest early too.

"Hold on, Shirou. I have something to ask you as well."
"Hm? What is it?"
"Why did you introduce me to everyone? I believe your actions were unnecessary as Rin said."
"No reason. I just introduced you because I didn't like it."

"Shirou, that is not an answer. You have to tell me what you didn't like."
Saber draws closer.
...Was what happened tonight that strange for Saber?

"I don't know. I was just eating and I just didn't like it when I thought about you being alone.
If anything, I just thought there'd be fewer secrets if I let Sakura and Fuji-Nee know about you."

"This is meaningless.
Rather, it is a disadvantage to let them know of my existence. I can hide myself in this house, so it would have been better if I was just standing by."


What's better?
Is she better off being an outcast while we're all eating?

"That's not true.
It couldn't be helped because even if it was good for you, Saber, it wasn't good for me. I don't think it's based on reason."
Saying so, I avert my gaze from Saber.

"I'm going out to the shed, so go back to the room first. I'll come back after I'm done."

There's no response.
Turning my back on Saber who doesn't seem to agree, I head out to the shed.

I go outside.
The quiet yard, lit by the pale moonlight.
The winter sky is high, and the stars are clear.

"Sigh."
I sigh without realizing.
Tohsaka is right.
I'm certainly contradicting myself.

The me that's trying to go to the shed, avoiding the room Saber's sleeping in.
On the other hand, the me that doesn't want to leave Saber alone.
Even though I find it hard to deal with Saber as a member of the opposite sex, I can't leave her alone as a human.
...It's only natural for Tohsaka to be disgusted with me.

"...Geez. I thought I was only inexperienced at magic, but my mental training is bad as well."

I murmur, looking up into the sky absent-mindedly.
The night wears on.
Since I'm inexperienced, I can't skip my training.
I can only refine myself, believing that I can reach something if I continue my effort.

It's lunchtime.
Even though it's only a temporary release from classes, the students run about the school busily.

"...All right. I won't look suspicious walking around now."
I finish lunch in a few minutes and go out into the hallway.
This is no time to complain that I've never done anything like this before.
The battle has already begun.
So I have to find the "suspicious places" Tohsaka was talking about in my own way.

"...I guess I should start with places where there aren't many people."
Well.
An hour until lunch break ends... I hope I can get good results out of this

After checking through the school building, I go outside just in case.
There's nothing wrong with the ground or behind the school building, but this area is too different.

"Could it be here too?"
...There were several strange places inside the school building as well.
Unpopular places like behind the stairs or within empty classrooms.
But this place is different.
Far from nobody coming here, this is a place people come every day.

"...Why didn't I notice?
Talking about strangeness, this place is the strangest"
I mutter, grasping my chest.
...This place is somehow suffocating.
The thick wind and moist air aren't just strange.
No, once I notice this smell, I actually feel like throwing up.

"Tohsaka was saying that there's a basis point for a boundary field.
I don't know how many there are, but this must mean the first basis point is around here..."
Then there should be some sign of it.

...
......
.........
...It's no good.
As I have no skill in detecting magical energy, there's no way I can see the sign that's constructing the boundary field.

"...Phew."
I guess it can't be helped. I'll go and tell Tohsaka about this place and
"What, are you looking for something, Emiya?"
"!"
I turn around at the sudden voice. Standing in front of the deserted archery dojo is

"Shinji."
"Hey. What a coincidence. I came because I had business in that area too... did you happen to see it?"
With a grin,Matou Shinji asks this happily.

"...See... what? There's nothing here."
"Oh, so you did see it. ...I see, so that's why you were with Tohsaka. That's right, it's more efficient to join up with other Masters."
"! Shinji, you..."

"Don't guard yourself too much Emiya. It's you and me, let's not hide anything from each other.
I don't know who you have. But you were forced into this ugly role of Master too, right?"

Shinji states it clearly without holding anything back.
That he, Matou Shinji, is also a Master.

"...Could it be? You're a Master, Shinji?"
"That's what I'm telling you.
Oh, but don't get it wrong. I don't intend to fight with anyone. Well, I'll certainly retaliate with deadly force if I'm attacked, but I won't do anything when nothing's done to me. See, I'm like you in that regard, right?"

Shinji laughs.
From his words, there seems to be no doubt that Shinji's a Master, but

"Well, I'm also surprised to find out that you're a Master. Let's call us equal in that regard. So, do you want to discuss something?"
"Discuss... I don't mind, but discuss what?"

"About what we do now.
Like I said earlier, I have no intention of fighting. But others aren't the same, right? So I feel uneasy unless I prepare for future misfortunes. It's troubling alone, but don't you think something would be possible with the two of us?"

...
So in other words, Shinji is asking me to cooperate with him?

"Well, let's not talk here. We don't know if someone might overhear us, so let's go somewhere else.
Hmm... yeah, my place would be good. Tohsaka won't be able to notice and it's safe even if we're attacked."

"What are you talking about? Lunch break is almost over, so if you have"
"Are you stupid? We can skip classes. Let's go, Emiya. I'm happy to know that you're a Master, so don't alienate me too much."

"I can't do that. People would be suspicious if we skipped classes."
"Damn, you're really stubborn... oh, I see!
You're right, people would normally stay safe!"

"But don't worry, I won't attack you no matter what. See, do I look like someone who would attack you from behind?"

"...? OhI see. You're right, I certainly can't just follow you."

".... Well, it's all right. You have a Servant with you too. I won't pick a fight against such a dangerous opponent."

...?
Does Shinji think I have Saber with me?
No, that's wrongShinji couldn't see a Servant in spirit form.
That's why he's wrongly guessing that I have Saber with me right now.

"Let's just go. It'll be no good if Tohsaka finds us."
Saying that, Shinji starts to walk away.

...I guess I have to follow him.
I'm interested in what Shinji has to say, so I'll skip the afternoon classes.

We go up the hill road.
The Western-style houses, on the opposite side to my house.
I guess Tohsaka's house is at the top, but I recall that Matou's house is on the back, as if avoiding public eyes.


It's an amazing building as always.
I came here to play a few times during middle school, but I haven't even been near it recently.
I haven't been invited since I became estranged from Shinji, and most of all, Sakura didn't like me coming to this house.

...Even though it's daytime, it's dim inside the house.
This building is made so that sunlight cannot enter it, and there aren't many lights in here.
I'm exaggerating, but you'd walk into the wall if you're not used to this place.

"Emiya, this way. I'm in the living room."
I don't know when he went in, but I can hear Shinji's voice from the inner room.
Even though it's been a year, my body still remembers this place and I make my way to the living room without getting lost.

There's no kind of light in the living room either.
The curtains are closed, and the sunlight is blocked off.
There are no artificial lights and the living room is in the dark.

"Emiya, over here."
I look over in the direction of the voice.
There is Shinji sitting in a chair, and
A figure of a woman like crystallized darkness.

"Let me introduce her. This is my Servant, Rider."

I feel a chill.
It's so bad that the back of my neck hurts like it's been slashed.

"...Weren't we going to talk with just the two of us, Shinji?"
I back up a bit and manage to say that.

"Oh no, it's just a precaution. I'd be scared if you just came and attacked me, so I have to have Rider by my side."
Stretching his hand out, Shinji touches his black ServantRider.
He caresses from her waist down to her thighs, as if tasting them.


Rider does not move at all.
She stands there like a statue, and keeps watch on me with her covered eyes.
...It can't just be an illusion that it feels like she sees even my fingertips shivering.

"You're like this even when you've invited someone? Aren't you being a little too wary, Shinji?"
"Come on, it was just a joke. I know you can't do anything like that.
But your Servant is a different story. Even I had trouble training mine. It's not unusual for a Servant not to obey its Master, so think of this as just keeping a small check on things."

...A Servant that doesn't obey its Master?
Certainly, Rider in front of me is different from Saber.
Saber is quiet, but not coldhearted.
But I can only feel coldness from Rider.

A human lacking humanity.
A black figure like discolored blood.
She doesn't seem like a Servant or a heroic spirit. She's so inorganic with no sense of lightness.

"...Rider's a way to keep a check on my Servant? I don't feel too good about that."
"Sorry. I'm just a novice, so I'm not experienced like you are. Forgive me for that."
"...Heh. It's not like I'm experienced either."

"Is that so? Then you should summon yours too. We would understand each other better that way, and it's more fair too.
Yeah, that'll be great! Hey Emiya, I showed you mine, so you show me yours."

...So Shinji is wrongly guessing that Saber is with me.
But there's no need to correct him on that.

"I refuse. If you're going to keep me in check, that's fine.
This should be enough if we're here just to talk."
"...What's with that? Hey, I'm saying I want to see it. I don't know what you're being a snob about, but shouldn't you listen to me?"

"Then our conversation's over. I didn't come here to show you my Servant. If that was your plan, I'm going home now."
"Damnall right. You're useless as always."
Shinji comments discontentedly and leans back in his chair.

"All right, let's get to it. Well, there's only one thing I want to talk about.
...Like I said before, do you want to collaborate with me, Emiya? I became a Master, but I don't know about this Holy Grail War thing. I want to cooperate with someone I know rather than staying on my own."

"Hold on. I want to ask you something too before that. I'll answer your question after that."
"What, you want to know why I became a Master?"
I nod.
As far as I know, Shinji isn't a magus.
I have to know how someone like that became a Master, or I can't cooperate at all.

"I heard Masters have to be magi as a basic prerequisite. Even though I'm inexperienced, I know a bit of magic. I summoned my Servant by accident and became a Master after forming a contract, but... did you summon your Servant by accident and get dragged into this Holy Grail War too?"

If that's the case, we're the same.
I won't easily be able to refuse his proposal of cooperation if that's the case

"I see. You became a Master by accident, huh?
 ...I see, I see. Good, that makes it more understandable."
Shinji smiles delightedly.

"Well, I guess it's similar in my case. The fact that I became a Master against my will is the same.
But don't get me wrong.
I knew what a Master was, and I've known about the Holy Grail War for a long time. The Matou family isn't like your family. We're a respected lineage of magi."

"!?"
The Matou is a lineage of magi...!?
"What, I never heard about that...!?
Hold on. Then, you and"
His sister Sakura knows magic too...!?

"Calm down, Emiya. The Matou family is a family of magi, but we're already dead.
I guess the ancestors of the Matou family came to this land with Tohsaka's family, but didn't adapt to the land here.
Down the generations, what's that thing, the Magic Circuit? That thing faded, and by the time I was born, the Matou blood had returned to that of an ordinary person's.
So members of the Matou family aren't magi. We're just a family that used to be magi."

"You guys were magi... then, only the knowledge remains?"
"Yeah, unfortunately. But even if we don't have Magic Circuits, that doesn't change the fact that we're studying magic. It was easy to find out about the Masters and the Holy Grail War with a bit of research. I'm able to relax even after suddenly being chosen as a Master, because of the teachings of the previous generations."


...I see.
I became a Master and understood the Holy Grail War because of Tohsaka.
Similarly, Shinji understood his situation because of the literature passed down his family.

"So in other words, you were taught just the knowledge of magic. ...Then, did Sakura learn magic as well?"

"Huh? Geez, you really don't know anything, do you?
Look, it probably doesn't matter to you since your family is a hybrid,[l]
but a magus of an old lineage only teaches his secret arts to one. If there are two children, you only make the eldest son the successor.

"You get less power if you separate something into two, right?
Magi place ten magics into one crystal and leave them behind to create a stronger blood. We don't make exceptions just because someone is from our family.

"So a family of magi doesn't teach magic to anyone other than their successors. It's common for the children who aren't chosen as the successor to be raised without knowing that their family studies magic, or they are to be given out for adoption.

"I seethank God, then."
I'm glad.
Sakura is a girl who should stay in a peaceful world without magic.
I can't let her get involved in a battle that forces you to kill others without reason.

"Well, now you know, Emiya.
Even though I became a Master, I'm not experienced with magic.
You're... let's see, you say you can use a bit, but your knowledge is that of an amateur.
See, don't you think we're a good combination? Let's cooperate since both of us became Masters against our will."

"...I don't mind that. But just to make sure, it's just to protect yourself, right Shinji?"
"No. There's that, but we have to attack the enemy right in front of us first. It seems she considers me her enemy."

"...Considers you an enemy...? You mean, Tohsaka?"

"Of course! She wouldn't be so unkind to me if that weren't the case...!
...Look, she's the type that won't forgive other Masters. You should know that by now if you've been with her.
I don't know what the reason is, but she lets her guard down when she's with you. I don't know why, but that perfect girl has her guard down!
Don't you see that it's a great opportunity to defeat her?"

Saying that, Shinji puts out his hand as if asking for a handshake.

...I won't cooperate with such an approach.
No, I can't.
If Shinji really wants to protect himself, he should talk to Tohsaka too and not just me.
And

"Shinji. Do you know that there's someone who supervises the Holy Grail War?"

"Yeah, that priest at the church, I hear. They say he's a survivor of the last war, but I didn't go see him because he seems annoying.
I'm not a magus, so it's a bother to be forced to follow the magi's rules."


That's contradictory.
If he wants to really stop fighting, he should go and see Kotomine first.

"Shinji. Do you know about the boundary field set up at our school?"
"I know. I can't tell, but Rider told me. What about it?"

"...Isn't it your doing? Tohsaka said it was the work of a Master at our school."

"No, it's not me. There's certainly another Master at that school, so it must be him."
"...? Tohsaka said there was only one other."

"You trust Tohsaka too much. Well, putting that aside, Tohsaka is wrong.
The presence she can feel is that Magic Circuit thing, right?
Then I'm not a Master she can perceive, because I don't have a Magic Circuit to begin with.
From the beginning, we're people that go under the radars of the normal Masters."

...I see.
The presence of a magus, the presence of the Command Spell... they are both things activated by magical energy.

Thenif someone without magical energy becomes a Master, the only way to identify them is to actually see them.
Tohsaka's method of searching for people with magical energy would not only overlook Shinji as a Master, but she wouldn't even notice him at all.
It's because Shinji does not have the presence of a Master that Tohsaka is searching for.

"...I see. Then there must be another Master that Tohsaka is sensing."
I should go home and warn Tohsaka about that.
Then there's no reason to stay here anymore.

"...! Hey Emiya, what about the cooperation thing?"

"I refuse. I won't participate in beating Tohsaka or anything like that.
First of all, she hasn't done anything.
Eventually... I will end up fighting her, but she can be trusted right now, and I want to trust her."

"...Heh, I think it'll be too late when something happens. But if you say so, fine. I'll wait and see."

Surprisingly, Shinji seems to have given up.
He doesn't try to stop me from going home, and he doesn't try to make Rider attack me.

...He's a really difficult person.
He acts like this, but he seems to try to be fair in his own way.

"...Hey Shinji. I might be persistent, but does Sakura know about you?"

"She doesn't, and I have no intention of telling her. I'm the successor of the Matou family. I'll let her be my sister and not know anything."

"That'll help. I want Sakura to stay like that."

"Huh.
I see. If you're worried about Sakura that much, I should thank you as her brother. ...All right then, I'll tell you something good, Emiya.
I don't know who it is, but one of the Masters is nesting at the temple."

"!? Temple... you mean Ryudou Temple!?"
"Yeah. As my Servant puts it, there's a witch up there. She is supposedly collecting souls on a large scale, so it'll be a problem if we don't do something about it fast."

"Wha"
If that's true, that is the fifth one.
And if that one is collecting souls on a large scale, there's a high probability that it is the cause of the story on this morning's news.

"That's all.
Well Rider, see him off. Emiya is on our side, so don't hurt him."
So ordered by Shinji, Rider approaches me.

"Uh... no, that's..."

"Don't be so reserved. You're my responsibility until you leave the house, so it'll be troublesome if you got hurt.
Oh Rider, you only have to see him to the front door. He has nothing to do with me once he exits, so treat him well until then."
Shinji retreats into the back room.

"......"
I look silently at Rider.

"......"
Rider, covered in black clothes, doesn't say anything.
But surprisinglylooking at her closely, I notice that she has clean features.

The long purple hair reaching to the ground only reminds me of the smell of blood, but at the same time, I understand it's really beautiful.
...She's wearing this outfit, so it's embarrassing to directly stare at her, but can it be that her outfit doesn't match her face?

To put it into a phrase, she's a shrine maiden covered in blood.
That contradictory appearance of one who is both holy and evil is this Servant called Rider.

"...But..."
Are all heroic spirits beautiful?
I think so while looking up at Rider's face out of curiosithey, Rider's tall for a girl.
Rider must be at least 170 centimeters tall.

"...Hmm"
This is no time to calmly observe Rider.
It's a problem to be alone with Rider, so I should get out of this place quickly.

Rider really follows me out to the entrance.
...I wonder.
She doesn't feel alive, but she might answer me if I talk to her.

1) Talk to Rider.
2) ...Keep away from dangerous things.
"Yay, I'll cooperate"
"Really?"
"Of course. Betraying Tohsaka and selling her out, betrayed by Sakura and getting sold out, the Baka-Nii-chans are now born!"

"...? I don't get your high tension, but does that mean I can trust you?"
"Yeah! But I'll betray you in the end!"
...So, the 20million-powers route with Shin-chan starts here.
Well, it would if we had the time.
"Eject!"
Optimus Prime will appear too!?
"...Rider. Was it true, what Shinji said earlier?"
I call out to her, not expecting a response.


There's no change in Rider. Her hair flutters in the wind.

"...Right. Sorry for asking a stupid question when we're enemies."
I raise my hand to thank her and exit.
Then.

"It was not a lie. It is true that a witch is up on the mountain."

"Huh... Rider?"
"Be careful if you are to challenge her. That witch knows men inside out."

Rider talks without interest.
I notice myself getting drawn in by her voice and quickly shake my head.

"Uh, um... thanks for the warning.
And please take care of Shinji. He's always like that, so please protect him."
I'm taken aback, but I manage a reply.
That must have sounded funny.

"...You must be a good person. I understand why Shinji is trying to have you on his side."
Rider smiles a bit and returns to the house after saying so.
Men of virtue should not approach danger.
No matter how beautiful she looks, Rider smells like blood.
...Well, it's true that I don't know anything about Rider, but that alone is enough to make me stay on guard around her.

...Well, and...
I'm not sure where I should be looking, so I don't have enough composure to talk to her.

"What is it?"
"...!"
I quickly look away.
"N-Nothing...! T-Thanks for seeing me off...!"
I start to run to get away.

I run down the hill.
The black Servant sees me off quietly.
I see the two off and return to the living room.
I said I had to talk to them after dinner, so Tohsaka and Saber are waiting in the living room with serious expressions.

"Thanks. So what is it that you want to talk about?"
"About the other Masters. There's something I want to tell you guys."
Saber raises her brows a bit.
...As a Servant, she must prefer battles where she uses her sword to these peaceful days.

But her wounds shouldn't have healed yet.
The wound on her chest made by Lancer's "Noble Phantasm" isn't something even Saber can heal quickly.


Thinking about that makes me hesitate telling them about Shinji.
I feel the same way as Shinji.
I want to avoid starting fights, andI think the girl in front of me swinging a sword is a disparate image.

"Shirou. You have something to tell us?"
"Uhyeah. Right, this is something I should tell you guys. ...To put it simply, I went and met with Rider's Master today."

"Wha... Rider's Master!? When did this happen!?"
"Ridiculous! Meeting with another Master by yourself, what were you thinking!?"
"Whoa, hold on, calm down...! It's all right. I'm not hurt, so don't get mad."

"Do not get mad!? No, I am not mad.
I am only stunned by your actions."
"...Me too. Well, it's no use arguing over what's done.
So, what's going on Shirou?"

Tohsaka and Saber glare at me with obvious anger in their eyes.
...Geez.
I thought they would say something about me being thoughtless, but I didn't think they would get this mad.

"...I met him this afternoon.
I only went because he wanted to talk to me, and it's not like we fought."
"I can tell by looking. So, what kind of a guy was Rider's Master?"

"What kind of guy... well, it's Shinji.
He called out to me when I was searching for the boundary field. He said he wanted to talk to me and asked me to follow him, so I went to Matou's house."

"WhaShinji? You mean, that Shinji!?"
"Yeah. Rider was obeying him, and he knew about the Holy Grail War. According to him, the Matou family is a lineage of magi with a history."

"Huhyeah, well, that's true, but... it can't be true. The Matou family was exhausted in the last generation. No matter what they do, their children won't have a Magic Circuit. That's for certain."

Tohsaka declares so.
If so, Shinji and Sakura really should be normal people without Magic Circuits.

"Yeah, Shinji said that too. But he said they still had the knowledge. Something about it being taught only to Shinji, the eldest son, so Sakura didn't know about it.
...In short, he's a Master rather like me. He said he doesn't have any magical energy, so he wouldn't be detected by your perceptions."

"...I see. I messed up. There certainly could be such cases... If they have grimoires remaining, he would be able to become a Master. Then geez, my actions were totally obvious to him! I'm an idiot."

Tohsaka is mumbling, reflecting on her actions.
...Hm. Tohsaka is close to perfect, but I think there are a few things missing.
Unfortunately, they're the most crucial ones.

"That was a mistake on my part. I should have kept an eye on Shinji. If I'd known, I wouldn't have let him construct that boundary field."
"Oh, Shinji said the boundary field at school wasn't his. He said there's another Master at school."

"Yes, that's true. It's obvious that there's another Master at school who we don't know about.
But Shirou... don't tell me you're just trusting Shinji's word that he's not the one who constructed the boundary field?"

"...No, I'm not that good-natured. As long as Shinji goes to our school, I think there's an even chance it's his doing. The alternative being the unknown Master."

"Even, huh? ...I think you're still being very good-natured.
Well, that's fine. That good nature is just the way you are, and that must be why Shinji told you his true identity."
"...?"

"Oh well. So what did you talk with Shinji about?"
"He asked me if I wanted to cooperate with him. It seems Shinji has no intention of fighting, so he seemed to want to ally with someone he knew."

"EhShirou, then you..."
"No, isn't it natural to refuse? I've already joined up with you.
Even if I were to agree, I'd have to ask you first."

"Oh... yeah. That... is true. But didn't you say you refused?"
"Yeah. Like I said, I answered Shinji on my own. It wasn't something to debate. ...Oh, was I too hasty?"

"...Not particularly. I think your decision was correct. Well, if you were the one asked, it's not something I can complain about."
The way she mumbles so isn't like Tohsaka at all.

"That was it from Shinji.
From what I saw, Rider isn't a strong Servant. Even putting Berserker outside of the picture, I don't think she had the same presence as Lancer. And Rider herself was more normal than I expected."

"...If you think so, it must be true. But a Servant's true power is determined by their Noble Phantasm. Please do not underestimate her until we find out Rider's true identity."

"...Yeah. I couldn't tell at all which heroine she was. See, Lancer and Berserker feel like heroes, right? But Rider didn't have that feeling. I felt like she was different from a normal Servant."

"Different from a normal Servant?
I do not understand. Rin, can you explain Shirou's strange feeling?"

"Huh...? Uh... yeah, I think I understand.
Well, it's because the Master influences which heroic spirit is summoned as the Servant. The Master and Servant end up being similar people.

"So if the Master is a noble person, a heroic spirit similar to them will be summoned. And if a person with a huge scar in their mind summons a heroic spirit, a heroic spirit with a scar in their mind appears as well.
The strange feeling Shirou had towards Rider must be that.
A Master with a crooked mind sometimes summons vengeful ghosts almost like heroic spirits instead of a hero."

"Vengeful ghost almost like heroic spirits... could that be what you were talking about before"
"Yes. A mass murderer that loves the sight of blood and thinks nothing of killing people.
Actually, there are heroes with only massacres to their legend, so it's not strange for something like that to become a Servant."


Is that so?
Certainly, I could only smell blood on Rider, but she didn't seem like a blood-thirsty killer....

"...Well, that's all there is to say about Rider.
There's one more thing, but it might be the most important.
According to Rider, there seems to be another Master at the Ryudou Temple. I guess this Master is collecting magical energy from everyone in this town. What do you two make of this?"

"Ryudou Temple...? You mean that temple at the top of the mountain?"
"Yeah. What, does it mean something to you, Tohsaka?"

"Of course not. It's just the opposite. I've never been to the Ryudou Temple.
I don't know what kind of a Master this person is, but normally, you wouldn't choose to position yourself in such a remote place."

"Right. I was also surprised when I heard that a Master's at the Ryudou Temple.
Even though it won't draw people's attention, there are many monks living there. If they act strangely, I think there'd be an quick uproar."

"Hmmm... I can't quite trust that story.
Even if it was the case, the Ryudou Temple is on the outskirts of the suburbs, right?
To reach out to Miyama City and Shinto is more like a waste of magical energy than a great magic. Such large scale magic is impossible even with the magical energy collected from it."

Then, Tohsaka starts to think with a troubled face.
I'm relying on Tohsaka's opinion, so there's nothing I can do until she talks again.

"No, that story is very plausible.
If one takes that temple, such magic would be naturally possible."
"...? Saber by 'that temple'you know of Ryudou Temple? I haven't taken you there yet."

"Did you forget, Shirou? I have participated in the Holy Grail War previously as well. I am well-informed about the city, and I know that the temple is a fallen ley line."

"Fallen ley line!? Hold on, that's what my house is! Why are there two foci of ley lines in one area!?"

"I do not know, but that temple is a place magi can call sacred.
I hear it is where the life of the region flows to, so it would be a perfect base to collect souls from. A magus need only to intervene in the natural flow to collect life forces from the whole city."

"...I've never heard of that.
But if that's the case, then it would certainly be possible for someone to steal life forces from all the people in the city..."

"In other words, it's just an area that's spiritually superior, right? That's only natural. You don't build a temple anywhere else."

"Ugho-of course. You don't need to tell me that."
"I thought so. Temples and shrines have been built in sacred places to protect the town since ancient times. It's not that the monks pray to grant happiness. They remove evil by sealing the ill-omened. On that basis, it's only natural that the mountain Ryudou Temple is on would be a sacred place."

"!"
"HeyI don't want to consider this, but did you think that Ryudou Temple was just for show?"
"Yeah, I did, is there something wrong with that!? Until now, I thought that temple was just for show because it didn't have any practicing healers!"
"Practicing healers...? What is that?"

"People who let ghosts go to heaven without using chants, faith, or prayers.
Enlightened people try to do so with just Buddhist powers, but monks without enough training haven't reached that level yet, so they add their own power to create spells like ours.
There's some kind of organization of those kinds of people in this country. But they're incompatible with the Magic Association, so I don't know too much about them.

"No, more importantly, the temple.
If that temple is a ley line, Masters should try to take it immediately. That's strange... why are others ignoring that place?"

"Because the Ryudou Temple is there, right? They keep watch so it doesn't get misused."
"The monks at the Ryudou Temple are all pure monks in training.
They aren't like us, so it'd be easy for a Master to control them."

"No, Rin, that is wrong. It would certainly be easy for a Master to gain control of that temple. But that mountain has a boundary field that is inconvenient for Masters."

"...? A boundary field that's inconvenient for us?"
"Yes. There is a spell on that mountain that tries to eliminate anything other than natural spirits. It has no effect on normal humans, but it is a dreadful place for us Servants."

"Eliminates anything other than natural spiritsthen that means Servants can't enter the mountain!"

"It is possible, but our abilities would degrade.
It is much like receiving a Command Spell telling us not to go near that place."
"Then how is the Master at the Ryudou Temple maintaining its Servant?"

"There is no boundary field once you enter the temple.
I hear that the boundary field was originally a border to protect the temple. The boundary field is only something that rejects people from outside, so it has no other powers."

"...Then if we make it inside, there's nothing that affects the Servant?
"...But that's strange. If you close the temple off like that, the ley line itself would stop. You would have to at least keep one way open or it couldn't be the center of the ley line, right?"

"Yes. If you think in terms of the temple, it cannot refuse those visiting through the proper entrance. It may be following on this idea, but I heard that the road leading to the temple does not have the boundary field.
At that temple, only the main gate does not have the power to command us Servants."

"...I see. That must be it. If you close off all the gates, the air inside will stagnate. Hmm, only the main gate, huh...?"

"That is all that I can tell you.
So, please come up with a plan. We have proven that there is a Master, so I believe there is only one action to take."


I know what Saber wants to say.
Her eyes tell me that since the location of the enemy is known, all that's left is to attack.
But

"I'm going to pass on this.
It seems like a trap, and honestly, I can't take any action with this little information. If you're going to go to their homeground, you should at least wait until you find out what kind of Servant they have."

"...That is unexpected. I thought that you would go and fight."
"Go ahead and insult me. Archer isn't fully healed yet, so I'll remain a spectator for a while."

"I understand. Then Shirou, let us go to the temple by ourselves."

Saber says this as if it is the natural thing to do.
But that's...

1) Fight.
2) Don't fight.
I'll attack.
If there is a Master at the Ryudou Temple and they are sucking magical energy out of people, then I should stop it as quickly as possible.

"I agree with Saber. I don't want to be the attacker, but it depends on the enemy.
We should go to Ryudou Temple right away, to see what kind of a Master this person is."

"Then let us go, Shirou. I am glad you are being proactive."
"...I see. If that's your decision, there's nothing for me to say. Just be careful."

"Tohsaka?"
"I'm going to rest. I'm not interested in a fight we've no chance of winning. If you don't come back tomorrow, I'll go and collect your remains since we're cooperating."

"What's with her? Saying such ominous things."
"That must be Rin's way of warning us.
There will be defenses against outside enemies at Ryudou Temple. We will have to pass through enemy traps and beat the Master."
"...Mm. Well, that's true, but..."

It's true that I'm not enthusiastic about beating this Master.
I only want to know who the Master at Ryudou Temple is and what their motives are.
Battle might be avoidable, and we'll retreat if things get dangerous.

...That's right. I won't let her look like that again.
If I judge that it's dangerous, we'll retreat immediately.
Even if Saber doesn't want to, I'll have to forcefully pull her back and bring her home

The clouds are moving fast.
There is a strong wind way up in the sky.

"Master, it is almost midnight."
"...Yeah. The town's fallen asleep. It's a good time to head out."

I nod, picking up my shinai bag.
Inside is a wooden sword I found in the shed.
It's not promising equipment for fighting against a Servant, but it should withstand at least one blow if strengthened successfully.

"Saber. We're just going to the Ryudou Temple to check things out.
It's enough if we can find out what kind of person the Master is and which class of Servant it has. There's no need to start a fight ourselves."

"...I understand. But if the enemy desires a battle and if I judge that you are in danger, that will not be the case.
As long as we are proceeding into enemy territory, I want you to be prepared for the death on either side."

The death on one side.
The scale of fate is divided between the Master at the Ryudou Temple and us, the intruders.
The scale is balanced now, but it might tilt towards one side or the other in a few hours

We go west from the intersection and run through the empty road.
Ryudou Temple is in the opposite direction from the developed Shinto, at the end of the winding mountain path.


A long set of stairs.
The road leading up to the remarkably tall mountain in Fuyuki City is engulfed in ominous darkness.

"...Saber.
Can you feel the presence of the Servant...?"
"Yes. I cannot perceive it precisely, but I can certainly feel a Servant's presence."
It may be the effect of the boundary field on the Ryudou Temple, but it seems Saber's perceptive abilities have deteriorated.

"This is not a good wind. This place was an ominous place last time, but it is worse now. ...Shirou, please do not leave my side even for a moment."
"......"
I answer with a nod and start up the stone steps.

The air is tense.
The forest submerged in the black of night is trembling with sounds.

With every step, a bad premonition settles into my back.

...The temple gates can be seen now.
Nothing has happened yet.
There's no sign of the enemy, and the temple gates are open as if inviting us in.

"Shirou, please stop."
"...! An enemy, Saber?"
"Yes. But it is not a Servant. The presence is too weak. It probably is a familiar for surveillance. We can ignore it, but"

There must be something wrong about it.
Saber makes a troubled expression and glares at the temple gates a few steps away.

"...Saber? Is something wrong...?"
"...I do not know. I cannot tell if this chill is because of the familiar or if it is the presence of the one protecting this temple gate.
There was some kind of a watcher at the gate, but it seems to be absent now.
...I do not want to admit it, but I consider that fact fortunate. It would be good not to confront the one protecting this gate."

"There was a watcher here, but it's not here now...?"
"Yes. They already know we are here.
There are two reasons the watcher would depart in spite of that. Which do you think it is, Shirou?"


...To hide from us, or to let us inside so we won't be able to get away.
...Either way, there will be no more progress unless we go in.

"...I definitely think it's a trap. Saber, can you tell what's going on inside from here?"
"No. I can only determine that there is some sign of a Servant in there."

"...I see. I guess we won't know anything until we go inside."
Saber nods.

"Let's go. No matter what they do to us, nothing will happen until we see their faces."
I approach the temple gate with Saber.

For a moment, the moon is covered by clouds.
My vision is engulfed in darkness.
"...Huh?"
In it, I thinkI see a beautiful snake within the trees.

"Hold on, Saber-"
I stop Saber who is trying to go through the temple gate.
"Shirou?"
Her golden hair turns around.
But that's-

"Enforced transference...!? Impossible! Transference magic in this ageI see, Caster...!"
Saber's figure is distorted.
What kind of magic is this?
Saber is distorted like a mirage and like that
"This is bad! Pull back, Saber...! Your body is fading away...!"
"No, Shirou...! It is you that is being transported...! Please take my hand quickly...!"
"...!?"
Transportation...!?
"Shirou, please give me your hand...! You will be pulled"
Saber charges forward to grab my hand.
At that moment....
"Kuh, uh!?"
...The figure of a Servant knocks her away from the side.
"You have let your guard down, Saber. Your powerful magic resistance was harmful.
If you weren't so powerful, you would have been able to protect him."
"What? A Servant...!"
Silver armor and black cloth collide.
Saber and Rider.
The two confront each other on top of the stone paving and...
"WhaSaber, Saber...!"
My existence is pulled out of the third dimension, goes through many dimensions, and is dropped back into my original dimension.
"AhUgu...!"
The blood in my body runs backwards.
For an instant, my organs go inside out and the sickness is as if I'm another living thing

"Oh. I tried to hook a dragon, but I only caught a small fish in my net."
"...!"
I turn to face the presence behind me.

"Guh...!"
There's no time to check who it is.
I swing my wooden sword, still in the bag, behind me.

"[aero]"
"Oh"
I'm blown away.
I'm struck on the right side of my chest, and I fall into the water.

"Huh?"
...The water surface is dyed red.
My bodythe right side of my chest is gone as if engulfed by a huge electrical fan.

"Stupid boy. To come to my temple with such rubbish magic resistance. It seems Saber too wasn't fortunate with her Master."


...The purple robe sneers.
I feel dizzyI have to stand up quickly and take Saber's hand, but I feel dizzy, and my body...

"Are you worried about Saber...? Don't worry, I'll take her. I need her Noble Phantasm to beat Berserker. You will die here, but she will continue her life as my slave."

"...Ah."
I can't find strength anywhere.
Blood.
There's no blood left in my body, and I can't keep my consciousness

"Goodbye, boy. With such weak abilities, you have no value even as a slavebut I shall use your Command Spells effectively."

The bent dagger cuts my left arm off.
...In the black water...
Only the movement of the clouds swallowing the moon is burned into my motionless eyeballs
"No, I feel the same way as Tohsaka. We shouldn't go there yet."

"What... are you saying you will not fight either...!?
No way. What was I resting my body for until now!?
Now we know where our enemy is, we have to attack!"

"I know that. But we have to wait, Saber.
If the Master at Ryudou Temple is that careful, there will certainly be a trap. It would be suicidal to go there without any plans.
As Tohsaka says, we should at least wait until Archer is healed."

"Such danger is normal. I have never expected to earn victory without getting hurt.
Even if the enemy traps pierce my body, I can fight as long as I do not give them my neck.
It is enough if we can beat the Master, no matter what injury I bear!"

"Whadon't say such stupid things. It's never okay to get hurt!
It's fine to go knowing the danger, but such a suicidal attack is stupid. ...As your Master, I can't let you do something so dangerous."

That's right. Going to the Ryudou Temple is certainly a suicide attack.
There will be some obstacle on the only road heading to the temple.
It's fine to accept that and go, but heading there without any plans is suicidal.
No matter how strong Saber is, she has me as a handicap.
If she pushes herself and fights, and if the result is

Just like what happened at that time, I can't approve of that.

"...What are you saying?
Look Master, Servants are meant to get hurt.
I will not allow my Master to avoid a fight in fear of that."

"It doesn't matter if you don't allow it. If you're going to push yourself, I'll stop you as many times as necessary.
...If you don't want that, heal yourself quickly. You're not fully healed yet, right?"

"It should not interfere with my fighting ability. There is no need to consider prolonging a battle due to my wound."
Saber's will to fight does not change.

"!"
Geez, why doesn't she understand even after I tell her this much...!?

"Okay, fine. But I can't agree that easily.
You lost to Berserker before! Are you going to push yourself and fight, and get both you and me defeated again!?
Don't kid me, I don't want to be killed that miserably ever again...!"


So.
I thought she would argue right back, but instead, she takes a breath and...
"...Bringing that up is unfair, Shirou."
She says as if apologizing.

"...I'm sorry if I'm being unfair.
But I won't be attacking anyone yet.
I can't just ignore the Master at Ryudou Temple either. But we're in no condition to fight. If we fight like this and lose, who'll stop the Master at Ryudou Temple?"

"Look, we'll be attacking only after your wound is healed and we're in perfect shape. If you have any complaints, go find yourself another Master."

"I understand. If Master says so..."
After answering in a quiet voice, Saber falls silent.

...The conversation is over.
Tohsaka has returned to her room and Saber returns to her room as well.

Staying alone in the living room, I really regret what I did.
No, it's too late already.
I could have put it another way, so why...
Why could I only convince her using words that make her look like that?
It is a quiet, windless night.
The time is past midnight.
There is nothing moving, and every living thing is asleep.
A settled darkness.
The town is like a dark sea that only has moonlight to illuminate it.

The clouds are moving.
There is no wind at ground level.
But way up in the sky, the air is roaring and letting the overlapping clouds flow.
"There is some wind."
Maybe she can hear the wind.
Looking up at the wind in the sky, she mutters quietly.

The one standing quietly in the yard glaring at the sky is a girl called Saber.
Her golden hair is beautiful even in the dark night, and her clear green eyes are watching the appearing and disappearing moon.

She casts a glance to the corner of the yard.

There is an old shed, and her master is sleeping inside it.
"It does not matter if you say you do not want to fight."
A clang.
The echo of steel melts into the night without reaching anyone's ears.
The moon disappears and appears.
In the instant the clouds in the sky float past, the girl's appearance has completely changed.

Heavy, hard silver armor.
Her figure covered in blue clothes is not something you can call a girl now.
Impregnable defenses made from magical energy overpowering others,and an invisible sword, hidden by magical energy beyond human levels.
That figure, said to be invincible on the battlefield, proves their existence to this day.

Even with the invisible sword, her majesty proves that she is an excellent swordsman.
That is why she is Saber.
The one said to have the greatest power of the seven Servants, the hero of the sword.
A knight among knights, true to decorum, and acting on its master's order.
Whatever the other heroic spirits may be, she is an ideal swordsman who will not disobey hey master.


But that ends today.
She is hereby disobeying her master's order.
Noshe is not disobeying her master.
She has considered how to make her Master win, and the result of her decision is this.

"He is too easy-going. He will just be killed by another Master like this."
But her Master this time will not be able to fix his personality.
So it will be her role to devote herself to being heartless.
If the Master is not going to fight, his sword will have to fight.

"The wound has not healed yet. I cannot hope for supply of magical energy from my Master."
But still, there will be no hindrance in battle.
Confirming her own abilities, she returns her gaze to the moon.
She has no more interest in the shed her master is sleeping in.
As she has taken arms, the only thing in her is the will to defeat her enemy.

The moon glooms.
Just as a large cloud covers the sky, Saber jumps over the wall of the house.

She runs through the darkness.
The silver knight runs through the sleeping town.

There is only one destination. The sacred mountain on the outskirts of town. The Ryudou Temple located on top of it.
Even Saber understands how hard it will be to single-handedly kill the Master at the temple.
As Shirou says, it is obvious she will suffer great injury. In the worst case, she will be the one killed.

But what kind of a Servant would she be if she couldn't do something like this?
The Servant is supported by their superior abilities and the pride that they have built up.
They have pride as heroes and confidence that they are the strongest, who have fought through many battles.
She is a heroic spirit passed down and honored from the ancient times, so defeat will not be acceptable no matter who the enemy is.
No, even imagining defeat is unforgivable.

Even though some childish parts remain, she is no exception.
Because she is crowned with the name Saber, she cannot ignore her pride.
Her pride will not allow her just to observe when faced with an enemy.

Therefore, she will not falter no matter what kind of trap is waiting, and all she can do is challenge by herself.
If they say there is no chance of victory, she will create one with her own sword.
The sword in her hand is a fine sword that has defeated many foes.
As she has the Invisible Air, there is nothing for her to fear.

She runs through the mountain pass and up the road to the temple.
What awaits her after the mountain pass are great stone stairs.

"...This is certainly..."
This is different from the Ryudou Temple she remembers.
The air is stagnant.
The wind is dead.
The ley line of the land is already contaminated.
This place is a land of death.
Once entered, one will not be able to exit alive.


But there's no hesitation.
Saber's speed does not drop one bit as she runs up the steps.

She runs through the scene.
The sound of her kicking the stone steps echoes in the air, and the mountain starts to squirm noisily.

They are long stairs.
The temple gate is far away even for Saber, who is running like an arrow.
To run such a long distance without being detected is impossible.
There will certainly be a surprise attack.
The gate should not be easily reached.
But no matter what scheme awaits, the only thing to do is defeat it and advance.

Nothing can stop her now.
Even if Berserker appears, she will break through it.
That is the product of her determination and confidence.
Saber feels so complete that she can break through any obstacles.

And at the top.
When she is about to reach the temple gates, that obstacle appears.

"!"
Saber stops.
Even she, determined to beat any enemy, is surprised by this 'enemy'.
A natural motion.
The gallant figure of the man that appears is far too lacking in enmity and unbelievably free of any openings.

"You"
Stopping, Saber readies her invisible sword.
The man with the moon at his back wards off Saber's killing intent as if it were just a light breeze.

"A samurai?"
She must be surprised by an opponent she has heard of, but never seen before.
Her second Holy Grail War.
Even for she who has seen many heroic spirits, this is a first for a Servant like this.


Sweat forms on Saber's brow.
Not because of fear, but because it is incomprehensible.

It's not as if there haven't been strange Servants like him before.
There should be no Servant more mysterious and suspicious than Archer from last time.
In comparison to that, the Servant in front of her has no fearful aspects nor a fearful weapon.

...That is why it is strange.
Nothing can be felt from the man.
There is no doubt that he is a Servant, but there is no sense of any magical energy nor a hero's Noble Phantasm.

So beating him should be easy.
It is true that this match would be over in one blow.
But her instincts tell her this:
Do not underestimate him.
This Servant has a way to seize a certain kill.


She cannot approach.
It could be said that the range of the man's weapon, the Japanese katana, is hard to judge... but above it, Saber's location is at a disadvantage.

Above and below the stairs.
There is about five meters between them.
She would certainly receive that sword before she could run up and rush him.

...But nothing can be felt from that sword.
It should be easy to repel it.
So she should not hesitate and rush in... but Saber instinctively understands she cannot close in without care.

She adjusts her stance slightly and glares at the enemy in front of her.
His identity is unknown, but she should at least determine the class of this samurai.
"...I ask of you. Which Servant are you?"
Saber asks, not expecting an answer.

With a smile,
"Servant Assassin, Sasaki Kojirou."

The Servant says so as if singing.

"Wha"
It is only natural for Saber to be surprised.
Servants should hide their identities.
Where in the world would you find a Servant that just comes out with it himself!?

"What are you"

"It is rude to ask like that. It is only natural to name oneself before a match, is it not? All the more so if the opponent is a fair one as you are. I would not expect for you to make a face like that."
Assassinthe man who called himself Sasaki Kojirou continues, as if enjoying Saber's confusion.

Saber surely does not know.
That this Servant is a swordsman who wielded a katana called Monohoshizao, and was often rumored to have no match in this large world.
No, what would change even if she knew?
His birth is unknown, and even his existence is uncertain.
His story was only told through word of mouth. There should only be one who knows the existence of this swordsman. That being the worthy rival of the rare-skilled swordsman, the one being his only enemy who defeated the man called Sasaki Kojirou.

One cannot call this person a hero.
The Servant AssassinSasaki Kojirou is an existence quite unlike Saber.
What Servant would know the skills of a swordsman who is usually not treated as a hero?

"But."
There are only two truths in front of her right now.
That this man in front of her is her enemy, and that he has given his name.
"...You have me. It is the etiquette of a knight for me to introduce myself if I am given your name."

Saber's voice in reply is heavy.
For her, it is too risky to state her true name.
She cannot reveal her true name no matter what torture she receives, and she has no intention of revealing it.
But that is only for the sake of victory.
She cannot disgrace the faith of the knight for such a thing.

"You called yourself Kojirou.
Servant Assassin, I am-"
"Stop. I see, you are the kind that must introduce yourself in return if given my name.
No, it was I who was rude."
Clank.
Assassin descends the stairs elegantly and confronts Saber.

"I do not intend to know my enemy like that. For us, these swords shall be enough to know our enemies.
Am I wrong, Servant Saber?"
"Wha"

"It should not be that surprising. I do not know what it is you are holding, but the pressure on your body is that of a swordsman.
...Hm, that dazzlingly beautiful aura of swordsmanshipwho else could you be but Saber?"
Another step.
Assassin descends the stairs and directs the point of his sword at Saber.

"I do not care about your true name. There will only be the fact that Servant Saber suffered defeat by my sword.
There is nothing to discuss. From the beginning, Servants are such beings, are they not?"
The swordsman smiles happily.

"I see. Certainly, that is true."
Answering, she readies her sword close to her.

"That is good.
Then let us duel, Saber.
I must see your sword skills said to be the best among all Servants"

The silver light jumps.
Hardness and softness.
The fight between two very different swordsmen begins under the moonlight.
"...!"
I wake up with a burning pain in my chest.
...I feel like I've had an ominous dream.
My body is sweating even though it's winter and I'm breathing hard.

"...What... my chest, hurts"
It feels like my heart is hot.
No, it's more like forcibly having heat driven into my heart from outside.

"From outside...?"
A small doubt.
Before I think what it could be, my body starts to run.

"Saber, you here...!?"
I run into the room.
I open the shouji and enter the room Saber should be sleeping in.

"She's not here. Don't tell me she..."
No, it has to be.
If she's not here, shemust have gone to Ryudou Temple by herself...!

"Idiot, why...!? You're not fully healed, so why!?"

I'm so angry it gives me a headache.
Why doesn't she obey me?
I didn't say I don't want to fight.
I just...
Didn't want her to be hurt like that...!

"Kuh!"
Nothing will happen sitting here.
I have to hurry to Ryudou Temple.
I can't let Saber fight alone.
No, who knows what good I'll be even if I go there, but there should be something I'm able to do...!

"Geez, you're a girl, so be more obedient...!"
I run.
I run outside without changing, take out the bike I haven't used in a while, and start to pedal with all my might.

I go down the hill with no brakes.
About forty minutes to Ryudou Temple even if I hurry.
I don't know when Saber left, but I have to catch up to her! And every minute counts!
"What the hell is that!?"
What greets me at the Ryudou Temple is a typhoon-like sound of wind.

"That'sSaber there, right?"
At the top of the steps, in front of the temple gates is an armored figure like Saber confronting a figure in a kimono.
The wind must be surrounding Saber as the trees on the mountain are creaking as if being pushed by her.

"Guh... Damn, is it even possible to get near her like this...!?"
I can't even open my eyes because of the strong wind.
I manage to get to the steps looking down, but the wind gets stronger.

"No, I can't"
...Get near Saber.
I can see Saber fighting someone way up there, but I can't do anything.

No, first of all, even if I do make it up there in all this wind, I'll only be a burden to her
"...!"
My left hand aches again.

The Command Spell on my hand is throbbing.
...I don't know what it means.
But I can't help it because..
...That image flashes in my head every time it throbs!

"...Damn, I'm getting desperate here...!"
I reach out to the steps with my eyes closed.
I lie down, trying not to be blown by the wind, and start to move upwards.

"...!"
The wind just gets stronger.
Something must be happening above as even I, an amateur magus, can feel that an enormous amount of magical energy is about to be released.

My Command Spell throbs.
It is as if it is warning me about the wind, and about something that is going to happen above me.

"...Wait. Could this be..."
Saber's magical energy?
But then

"Why is she doing something like this with that wounded body of hers!?"
No, should she even be doing this at all?
Saber cannot replenish her magical energy.
So she shouldn't be using her magical energy readily.
She has to leave the fighting to me and stay as my backup, or her magical energy will run out and


I get up and run up the stairs.
This is no time to be crawling.
I don't know what Saber is planning to do, but I have to stop her!

"!?"
It must be luck that I avoided it.
Something like a dagger flies across right in front of me as I try to run up to the temple gate.

"Who's there!?"
I look toward the trees in the mountain off to the side of the stairs.
...There's no mistake about it.
I didn't notice because of the strong wind before, but someone else is hiding near here...!

"Don't play arounddon't hide like a coward and come out...!"
I raise my voice.
That voice that should have been drowned out by the wind...
...Echoes through the area, surprising even me.

"The wind... stopped?"
I look up at the temple gate.
There...[r]
...is a man in a kimono holding a longsword, and Saber's back.

"Stop right there, Saber. Someone is trying to steal a glance at your technique."
The man in the kimono says with a faint smile.
He is staring into the forest like I am.

"If we continue, this match will not be between just us.
I do not know if the shameless one hiding there is going to attack the winner or if it is only here to watch.
...But either way, this is less interesting now."

The man says so with disinterest and starts to go up the stairs.
"Stop...! Are you not going to settle this match, Assassin...!?"

"I will settle this match if you come through this gate. I will not allow anyone to step through this gate.
Butthat is unfortunately my only role.
I have no intention of stopping you if you are to retreat. Well, that idiot hiding in the trees is a different story. If it is someone I do not take a liking to, I would not let them through on my life nor would I let them retreat alive."
The man called Assassin goes up the stairs.

"You were manipulated, Saber. Well, the same goes for me as I did not notice the presence of this person. I could have shown you my full secret technique if we continued, but we were interrupted at a bad time. It must be fortuitous for you."

"!"
Saber is hanging her head in regret.
...The killing intent fades away.
Not because of Assassin's words, but Saber herself must know it is disadvantageous to fight now.

"See, your pick-up is here as well. That boy must be your Master. Leave before the idiot sneaking a look at us changes its target to him."
And Assassin disappears.
He must have become a spirit, and it must be his demonstration that he will not attack us unless we advance.


Saber does not say anything.
She just has her back to me as she quietly stands there.

"...Hey, Saber...?"
There's no answer even when I call out to her.
"...?"
I think it's strange, so I start to go up the stairs...

"What...?"
The armor Saber had on suddenly disappears.
The girl in her defenseless blue clothes sways without turning around.

"!"
I stop Saber with my arms as she falls back down the stairs.
Saber does not move at all. She is unconscious with her eyes closed in pain.

"...Haa... haa... haa... haa...."
...I'm finally home.
It has taken two hours to carry Saber back from Ryudou Temple.
There were lots of problems, but we managed to get home safely.

"...Haa... haa... ah."
I lay Saber down in the hallway.
Saber was really light. She only weighed about forty kilograms, so I wouldn't normally have been this tired.

But that's only if the weight isn't moving.
I didn't know that it was such a hard task to carry a sleeping humana girl too.
The fatigue is great not physically, but mentally.
It's because my attention was disrupted by things like her body's softness and by having her breathing softly right by me.

"...Geez... why did she have to suddenly lose consciousness?"
I look at the sleeping Saber.
...She must not be completely unconscious.
She looks like she'll open her eyes if I call out her name, even though she's sleeping like a corpse.

"......"
...Damn.
There were so many things I wanted to say when I left the house, but I can't say anything when she makes a sleeping face like that.

"...Oh well. I'll bring it up when you wake up, Saber."
I murmur.
And the instant I reach out to carry Saber again-

"...Well, I don't care. It doesn't concern me what your taste is or what you're doing."
For some reason.
Tohsaka is in the hallway even though it is past two in the morning.

"T-T-T-T-T-T-Tohsaka...!?"
"Why are you looking at me if you've seen a ghost? I don't have any complaints, so you can continue. I only got up to take a drink."

"Ehuh, you're wrong! Wrong, completely wrong!
Um, it's a long story, but I'm only trying to take Saber to her room... do you understand...!?"

"Yes, so it seems."
"D-Don't lie to me! It sounds like you don't understand!"

"I'm saying I do. Saber went to fight by herself and you went and stopped her, right?
And there was some sort of trouble, so Saber came back unconscious. How about that?"

"Uh... y-yeah. Amazing, you're perfectly right. But how do you know?"

"Of course I can tell. There was a likelihood that Saber would go off to battle by herself, and the Master will be informed of that once the battle starts. That's why this development is within the scope of my deduction."

"I see. That's fine, but..."
...Um, so Tohsaka predicted that Saber would go out to fight by herself?

"So what are you going to do? Aren't you going to take Saber to her room? If you let her sleep here, I'm sure even a Servant will catch a cold."

"So I was about to take her to her room"
I was going to carry her, but...
...Um.
It's hard to do so when she's watching.

"...Tohsaka. Sorry, but can you carry Saber?"
"Me? Well, that's fine. Then can you prepare some tea? I'm curious to hear what happened."

Tohsaka picks up Saber.
...I'm uneasy about her being so understanding, but as long as I've asked her to do so, I have to go prepare some tea.

Tohsaka takes Saber to my room.
I am preparing tea in the kitchen.

"By tea, she must not mean Japanese tea. ...This place only has English tea in teabags though."
Well, it can't be helped if we don't have it.
I decide she can complain if she wants and I make the tea with a teabag.

"Shirou, can I talk to you?"
Oh, Tohsaka's back.
"Yeah, hold on a moment. I'll be there right away."
I put the two teacups on a tray and head to the living room.
There.
Next to Tohsaka is Saber, changed into her normal clothes.

"S-Saber...!? Why? Weren't you asleep...!?"

"She was. But it's not a long-lasting sleep, and she just woke up.
It seems she tried to use a large amount of magical energy at once and her body shut off. It's like an electrical breaker. The kind that forces the power to be turned off before it shorts out, you know?"

"......"
Saber is quiet as Tohsaka explains.
"Y-You"
Seeing her usual attitude, my complaints return.

"Saber, you...! Do you know what you did!?"

"There is no reason I would not know.
I proceeded to Ryudou Temple and battled the Servant Assassin. We noticed the presence of a third Servant during our battle, so we suspended it."

"...! No, I'm not talking about that!
What I'm asking is why you fought!"
"That again? It is only natural for a Servant to fight. How about you, Shirou? Why are you, a Master, telling me not to fight?"

"Well, that's"
I unconsciously hesitate to reply.
...Well, battles are inevitable as long as I've decided to fight as a Master.
I know I'm contradicting myself by telling Saber not to fight.
But still...
I can't let something like that happen again.

"Then I would like to ask you instead. It seems that you dislike battles, but do you really expect to survive the Holy Grail War like that?
It seems that we will only be defeated by other Masters if we follow your policy."

Of course not.
I will repel dangers that come at me, and I don't intend to get killed helplessly.
But completely aside from that, I don't want Saber fighting.

"No.
I don't hate the fighting. I just, um"
It must be much simpler than that.
In short, I...

"Um, girls can't get hurt. As a guy, I can't let that happen. So if I'm going to let you fight, I'm going to fight myself."
"Whayou are saying you will not let me fight because I am a woman...!?

"Are you insane!? Servants are beings that protect their Master. It is natural for us to get hurt as we are beings summoned only to fulfill that task...!
The sex of the Servant is of no concern, and beyond that, you are treating me, a warrior, as a woman!?
Please take those words back, Shirou...!"

Saber comes at me with a glare.
But I won't be pushed back by her pressure.
What is she sayingthat she is a knight before she is a woman?
Saying such unreasonable things with that small body of hers that even I can carry...!

"I would never take my words back! It may be true that you're strong, but you're still a girl! Don't get worked up over such an insignificant thing, you idiot!"

"...! Are you not the one getting worked up over insignificant things...!? Are you saying you do not want to be protected by a woman!? My body is that of a heroic spirit. Forget about such trivial aspects!"

"It's not trivial at all! Geez, it's not okay for me even if it's okay for you! It was a mistake from the beginning to have someone fight in my place. I can't"

I can't allow someone to get hurt,In place of saving me.
I should be the one doing the saving.
I have been working hard to become a person who can help others like my father, so

"...Damn. Listen, just don't fight, Saber.
It's the guy's role to fight, so I'll be doing the fighting. You shouldn't have any complaints about that, because I'm saying we'll fight as you wish."

"Whatyou are absurd...! Do you think a human can match a Servant!?  You should already know you are no match for the Servants!
Please recall what happened when you were attacked by Lancer.
You would have certainly been killed if I had not appeared. It will be the same against any Servant!"

"Y-You won't know unless we try! I was just unprepared that time. Now, we can prepare as much as possible, so I might at least be able to sneak an attack on them!"

"Ridiculous. A shield prepared by you would be no better than paper."
"Whoa, that's a horrible thing to say, Saber!"

"You are the one insulting the Servants. You are conceited, thinking that you can defeat a heroic spirit as a mere human."
"!!!!"

Saber and I glare at each other.
It's no use. It looks this conversation is going nowhere with no compromise in sight.

"You're wrong, Saber. Shirou isn't insulting the Servants. I'm interrupting because the conversation won't go anywhere if you misunderstand that."
"Rin...? What do you mean by that...?"

"Well, in short, he just doesn't want to get you hurt. I don't know why, but Shirou is full of devotion to others.
Right? Saber is more important to you than you are, right?"
Tohsaka looks at me.

"...T-That's not true...! I didn't say Saber was important to me."

"That's a lie. You couldn't say you'd fight yourself unless you thought so.
Because you already know you can't beat a Servant yourself, right? But saying you'll fight in spite of that means that Saber is more important than you."

"Huh?"
Ah... um?
Well, it's like that if she says so, but

"That's why you fight even though it's absurd to do so. You try to win even when you realize you have no chance of winning. You don't care if you die in the process.
Because for you, though I don't know why, other people are more important than yourself."


No.
I didn't mean that at all...

"That's why. You should understand, Saber. He's an idiot who will protect you against that Berserker. That's why he's saying seriously that he'll fight."

I don't know how much of Tohsaka's explanation Saber understood.
But Saber takes a deep breath and looks at me.

"Shirou"
"W-What, Saber?"
"I will approve of you fighting. But if that is the case, I have something else in mind as well."
"S-So, what?"

"Sword training. I will teach you as much swordsmanship as is possible in the time allowed. If you will accept that, I will accept your opinion as well."

"Wha"
Does that mean she will train me in swordsmanship...?
Um, because she allows me to fight from now on...?

"Hold on. That's excess weight on your mind, Saber.
Teaching Shirou swordsmanship? Cut it out. There's no way you can match a Servant with something like that."

"That is true. But it would be better than not knowing.
It should at least reduce hesitation in battle.
I can only gamble on Shirou's determination after that, but that is how real battles are anyway. There is nothing one can obtain if they are not fit for it."

"...Hmm... well, you're right when you put it like that.
Readiness to fight won't come unless you do so at least once."

"Yes, so once... no, not once, but as many times as time allows, I would like for Shirou to experience 'death in battle' and become familiar with fighting."
The two talk dangerously.

"Hold on. I didn't say I would"

"Then I guess I'll teach him about magic.
If Saber's going to train his body, I'll train his knowledge. ...Well, that was the initial promise anyway, so I guess I'll start proper training for him tomorrow."

"Please. If you do that, I can concentrate on the sword myself."

"It's fine. Then since we're decided, let's break up for tonight. It looks like we're going to be busy tomorrow."
Tohsaka waves goodbye and disappears into the outbuilding.

"I will be resting as well. You should rest also, Shirou. I will have you train in the dojo tomorrow."
She gives a small bow and goes back to her room.


In the living room are the untouched teas and myself standing there dumbfounded.
"So I never said I would..."
The words I murmur are ignored.

Well.
The already confusing situation looks like it will get even stranger.
I can't even guess what will happen tomorrow.

"...I'll sleep. I have to save my energy at the least."
Everything starts from my body.
...Well, um.
You could say that I can only rely on the hope that if my body is well-prepared, I can overcome any hardships.
The next day.
After a normal morning, I enter the living room to find a complicated breakfast table.

"Sorry, Sakura. I can't eat butter. Pass me that marmalade over there."
"Really? Tohsaka-Senpai, you seemed like you didn't like sweet things."
"Nonsense, no such girl exists. It's not that I don't like sugar, but I can't take it. If I let my guard down, I grow where you can't see, so I can only eat sweets once a week."

"...? But you're still eating marmalade, Senpai?"
"I eat sugar in the mornings. I have to eat at least a bit, or the backlash later on could get scary."
"I see. Even if you eat only twice a day, it will get worse if you eat twice as much."
"That's right. ...Hey, I wasn't going to say anything, but you eat a lot, Saber. You have a small frame, but you're eating as much as Sakura."

"Is that so? I think I am average. I believe the bread Sakura is eating is much more substantial than mine."
"T-That's not true...! You, Tohsaka-Senpai, and I all have two slices of toast."
"But the thickness is different. Ours are one centimeter thick while yours are two, so you are eating a lot. You are in your growing period, so it is good to get energy. How about eating not just one but actually finishing your share, Rin?"

"I'm telling you I can't. It's not like I'm Sakura and all the nutrients go to my chest. If I eat a lot in the morning, it'll increase. I usually don't eat breakfast, so I'm compromising already."
"...Tohsaka-Senpai, um, please don't talk about that in front of Senpai."

"...Hmm. You say 'it' will increase, but why do you avoid using specific terms, Rin?"
"Well, it's about those things you can't see. Oh well, you can see Sakura's, so you can leave her out of this."
"S-So please don't talk about it!"


I take a bite of the well-done toast.
Perhaps my brain just doesn't follow what's going in front of me, but I'm eating toast and not joining the conversation.
...Well, the truth is that there's no room for me to cut into the conversation.

"...I guess I didn't need to worry."
They seem to have a good relationship for now.
Tohsaka is the same as always, and Saber is more open than she was last night.
Sakura is... well, she still seems to be a bit resistant to Saber, but it doesn't look like she dislikes her.

"...I'm worried that Fuji-Nee isn't here, but she should be here tonight......"
The shock last night must have been a big one.
Well, she will probably come and eat dinner, so I'd think she'll have calmed down by then.

Breakfast ends, and I start cleaning up.
"Senpai, is it really okay leaving all the cleaning up to you?"

"Yeah, I'll do it. You have a club to go to.
There was that incident yesterday, so you should go."
"...Yes. Then I'll go on ahead, Senpai."

Sakura bows also to Tohsaka and leaves the living room in a hurry.
That leaves the three of us.
Which means, once Sakura leaves, the three of us who know the secret remain.

"Then I shall excuse myself as well. Please call for me if you need anything."
"See ya, Saber. I'll look after Shirou, so please take care of this place while we're gone."

"Yes. Please take care of Shirou, Rin."
Bowing lightly to Tohsaka, Saber returns to her room.

...Well, there's nothing to do here.
So she must want to save her energy by sleeping, but......

"...Geez. Does she only think about fighting?"
"Of course. You should start to show some willingness or Saber will lose patience with you.
Even though her wound isn't healed yet, she's not one to stay quiet forever, right?"

A clicking sound.
As she makes a scary comment, Tohsaka turns on the TV.

"Hm? This news again."
The morning news streams from the TV.
I listen to it while washing the dishes in the kitchen.
...Well.
The content is the same as the news I heard a while ago.

"They're saying there was another gas leak incident over in the Shinto area.
...That's stupid. That kind of thing is happening here too."
"?"
Hold on.
Did Tohsaka say something really worrying?

"Tohsaka, what do you mean by that?"
"It's that the people are weakening with no obvious cause, right? People that have lost consciousness without an obvious cause, carried off to the hospital in a coma.
There must be a lot of them by now. There doesn't seem to be a danger in the victims' lives right now, but what happens in the future will depend on what the instigator decides."

"Wha"
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Not only in the neighboring town, but over here too?
Comas with no cause?
Numerous victims?
No, the problem is

"Tohsaka, are you saying it's the work of another Master?"

"Who else could it be? Please get used to it. You are a Master too, you know."
"That'strue. ...But, why didn't you tell me before, Tohsaka?"

"This incident isn't as simple.
The Master that put up the boundary field at school is third class, but this Master is first class. He isn't killing anyone. He's just storing power by absorbing half of their lives."

"...Well, it is true that the speed is slower, it doesn't break the rules of magi. And there's also no need to push oneself. This Master is stealing the simplest form of magical energy, 'life force', out of people in the city from a place far away."

"A place far away... can this person collect magical energy from such a distance?"
"It must be a really skilled magus.
Both Shinto and Miyama City. Only great magi can create an 'absorption' that can cover two towns."

"...Or maybe the Master has secured a superior spiritual ground. My father was saying something about a ley line in Fuyuki City, so if one took up a position there, it would be easy to collect life force..."

"...? Hey, Tohsaka."
"There weren't any references to it in Father's study, so if there is one, it'll be in the master's room... Oh man, that place is so weird even now, so I'd like to stay away from it if I can.
...But then, all I can do is ask Kirei... no, I can't. I can't be in debt to him."

"Tohsaka, hey"
There's no answer.
...It's no good. Tohsaka is immersed in talking to herself.

I reach the school gate with Tohsaka halfheartedly.
The front gate has students arriving at school, and the school is starting another normal day.


But still, there is an odd feel to it.
I went through the front gate without noticing it yesterday, but I can certainly sense it if I look for it.
...How can I put this... it's so calm that even my instincts go numb.

"...You're right. The air is different from outside. It's like sweet honey."
"Oh, that's the way you feel it, huh? ...You're unskilled at detecting magical energy, but you might be sensitive to disorders in the world."
Tohsaka ponders.

"But sweet honey, huh? Speaking figuratively, like an insectivorous plant?
Yeah, that's a good way of putting it."
"...An insectivorous plant... that image is really bad."

"Really? I don't think your instinct is off. Because in this school, everyone will be eaten alive when the lid of the boundary field closes."

"!"
She sees through the aspect I didn't say, and I gasp.
"As I thought. You're fun because you're easy to understand."
"Whatever. It's not fun for me."

"Don't get mad. Don't worry because I know what you want to say. You're thinking you don't want to involve the students here, and I don't want to use this place as a battlefield. So there's only one thing to do, right?"

"......"
These are words to test me.
Tohsaka is telling me...
The Holy Grail Warthe "enemy" I said I will fight against, the Master who is willing to drag in innocent people in order to win, is at this school.

"I know. We have to find the Master who constructed this boundary field and do something about it. And if he isn't willing to remove the boundary field, we'll just beat him."
"That's right. I'm glad you understand."

"Well then, I'll look for whoever constructed the boundary field, so you go and check suspicious areas.
I already looked around, but there might have been something I missed. You seem to be good at finding these points, so I'll let you do it."
Tohsaka waves her hand and runs into the school building.

"HeyEven if you say that, I have no idea...! What kind of places are suspicious ones, Tohsaka!?"
"To put it in your words, somewhere where the air is sweet!
Just look for a place where the honey is really sweet!"
She yells back, running.

And Tohsaka disappears into the school building.
"...What is she? Running away suddenly like that, I don't get what she's thinkin"

"Oh."
The bell for homeroom rings.

"I-I seehey, why didn't she tell me that if she knew...!?"
I hold my bag and run full speed.
After that incident yesterday, who knows what Fuji-Nee will say if I'm late.
I descend the hill and return to the intersection.
If I head up to the residential district on the other side, I will be heading home, but

"...There's a Master at Ryudou Temple, huh?"
An hour's walk to the mountain.
Taking the mountainside road, one can reach the mountain gate that leads to the Ryudou Temple.

The Ryudou Temple is a large temple up on the mountain, as big as our school.
Its cemetery is large, but more than that, it's a small world made up of fifty practicing monks.
The people of the town are helped by the people of Ryudou Temple, but they also honor it as a sacred place that is not to be visited lightly.

"...Come to think of it, I haven't been to Ryudou Temple recently."
Ever since I went there last summer to stay there as mental training.
The temple's life gets really hard during the winter, so I was thinking about returning there during the winter

"Hm? What is someone who boycotted afternoon classes doing here?"
Speaking of the devil, or whatever...
I run into Ryudou Temple's successor, Ryudou Issei.

"Yo. Is school over already?"
"Of course it's over. I'm heading home since I don't have anything to do for the student council, but is something wrong? You seemed to be staring at the mountain."

"No, there wasn't anything wrong. I just felt like going home."
"Heh. The teachers would be out of business if people skipped class just because they feel like it. So, I'm asking why you were looking at the mountain."

"...Well. Issei, it's a small thing, but has there been anything strange going on recently?"
"Well. Change is common, but nothing has drastically changed. The mountain is always peaceful, and peace makes up ordinary days."

"Sorry Issei, I'm being serious here."
"H-How rude! I'm serious too!"

"It looks like it. Then it's good, I guess it was just overanxiety."
"Fine, if you understand. I wouldn't joke with you."
With a cough, Issei calms down.

"...But, hmm... There has been a change, but I wonder..."
"Huh...? A change? In the temple...!?"

"Yeah. Not the mountain, but the air at our temple is restless. She's apparently an acquaintance of my father, but we've taken in a bothersome guest. It's a problem because she is beautiful.
Geez, why is everyone making so much commotion over one woman?"

"Womandoes Ryudou Temple have nuns?"

"No. This is a special circumstance, and we're letting her use a room until the wedding celebrationno, but this person is so beautiful that it even captivates me when she's getting water from the well."
"What do you mean 'a special circumstance'... hey Issei? Hey, are you listening to me?"

"Mm, sorry. That is why women are bad.
Reject lust, be calm Issei."
The student council president starts to recite Buddhist scriptures.
...Geez, he's so serious, so he's hard to deal with when he gets like this.

"Heeeey, are you all right Issei?"
"No problem. My training is insufficient, so I wish to purify myself more."

I guess he still didn't hear me as he disappears into the back of the town.

The sun is already setting by the time I reach my house.
I'm home first just like yesterday.
Sakura and Fuji-Nee will be here soon, and Tohsaka should be back too.

"...I'll talk to her about what I heard from Shinji after Sakura and Fuji-Nee go home..."
There's no point in talking about it when those two are here.
That decided, I have to go and prepare dinner.

Tohsaka got me yesterday, and I have to try to put Fuji-Nee in a better mood.
Cooking takes time and effort before love.
If I am to go for a sure win, I will have to spend twice as much time.

So.
After all that, what happened is...

"Huumph! What, I didn't lose! Stupid Tohsaka-san! Bully!"
"I'm talking about the taste of the food. Um, it's the best dinner so far according to Fujimura-Sensei, so I'm saying we should share it among everyone."

"... Hmmm... I think she's saying something else.
Tohsaka-san said she didn't want to eat the food Shirou cooked."

"That's only in the mornings. I eat dinner like normal and we take turns cooking dinner, so it is my right to eat.
If you don't like that, please take my place tomorrow."

"Ughthat personality that strikes precisely at my weak point. Man, I didn't think you were such a terrible student."
Fuji-Nee reluctantly returns the pot to the table.
And so, the specially prepared rice returns to the table safely.

"...Hold on, Fuji-Nee, I cooked a lot so you don't need to hurry. I made enough for everyone."
Munch, munch.

"T-That's right... but Senpai, isn't this a bit too much?"
Munch, munch.

"Yes. Two casks for four people is obviously too much."
Munch, munch.

"It's not a cask, it's a pot. And it's fine. The rice is today's main dish, so there can be lots of it. If there's any left over, I'll make some riceballs and it'll be lunch for tomorrow."
Munch, munch.

"Oh, can I have some too? I usually don't like fried rice, but this is exceptional. There are lots of things in it. What exactly did you use?"
Munch, munch.

"It's basically rice mixed with mushrooms, right? There are lots of details, like the way it's using citrus instead of fried things for its aroma."
Munch, munch.

"...Fine! I'll eat it all myself then! You watch!"

Fuji-Nee must have given up taking the pot for herself, as she starts to eat really fast.
She empties her bowl quickly and asks for more in no time.

"...Fine, but it won't run out even if you take it slow, Fuji-Nee."
"That's fine! I'm going to eat Shirou's food, so I won't give it to some stranger!"
She snatches away the bowl.

"?"
I don't get it.
Sakura is smiling awkwardly, Tohsaka is ignoring Fuji-Nee, and Saber is eating her food.
...I put in a lot of effort to make this, but it might have had the opposite of the desired effect.
The dinner that was supposed to have Tohsaka admit defeat ends loudly because of Fuji-Nee's strange actions.

"Then, see you Senpai."
"Yeah. Fuji-Nee, please take Sakura home safely."
"Yeah, yeah, I know. Don't worry."
Stepping lightly, Fuji-Nee holds Sakura's hand.

"What? Shirou, you look like you're wondering about something."
"Of course I'm wondering. Usually, people can't move after eating that much."

"Really? It was tough, but it's fine once you swallow it."
So you should realize the problem is that there's no limit to that, Tiger.
Just as one would expect from a wild tiger. If possible, I don't want it accidentally trespassing into human society.

"Then see you tomorrow. Don't stay up late, you two."
"Yes, good night Senpai."
"Yeah, night Shirou."
The points of the swords cross.
The swords are swung many times.
Numerous blows.
The sword and the katana repel each other, scattering sparks.
The session of more than a few dozen blows does not change the positions of the two.
Assassin, positioned above, does not retreat even a step,and Saber, trying to ascend the stairs, is unable to draw nearer and uselessly wastes time and spirit.

"Haa!"
Saber rushes in again.
Assassin swings his longsword without difficulty and defends completely against Saber's charge.

No, it isn't as simple as defending.
If Saber's sword is lightning, Assassin's sword is a hurricane.
Even though it does not match Saber in speed or power, its elastic tracks parry Saber's every blow.
And the counter increases speed and flows toward Saber's neck like a strong wind.

When Saber steps in again after avoiding that attack, the sword she has avoided comes at her again in no time.
In contrast to the straight path Saber's sword takes, Assassin's sword takes a curved path.
Assassin's blade is graceful, but since it moves in an arc, it does not take the shortest route.
So he shouldn't be able to make it in time against Saber's sword moving in a straight line, but there is something about Assassin that reduces that difference to zero.

"Kuh!"
The charge stops.
Her sword won't make it in time against his sword's counter-attack.
She steps back, knowing the only way she can avoid it is to retreat.

Assassin's swordplay is fascinatingly beautiful. But at the same time, it is so fast that it is hard to follow.
Is that contradiction because of Assassin's skill or the unfavorable position of attacking someone on higher ground?
Without a definite answer, she avoids the sword pursuing her and parries the point trying to pierce her neck.

"!"
When she notices, she has retreated a few more steps.
It's such a long sword.
It should be easy to go inside on him once she has parried it away once, but she somehow cannot manage to do so.

The enemy's excellent skill and the definitely disadvantageous ground.
Saber bites her lips, thinking she would not have this much trouble with that longsword on flat ground.

"It is indeed hard to fight against. I did not imagine an invisible sword would be this troublesome."
Assassin does not move.
For him, this is only a battle of defense.
He has no need to chase the retreating Saber without reason nor forsake his advantage of higher ground.

"...Hmm. I believe this is the first time you've even seen a katana, is it not?
My sword is a heresy, and it will slice the head of one of average skill. I am happy you have blocked this much, Saber."

"And on top of that, your drive is marvelous. You are able to do so much with that small body of yours. Your body must indeed be well-trained."
As he has no need to keep attacking, Assassin observes Saber calmly.

His sword wavers, losing strength.
She cannot charge as if that is an opening.
There are no stances for that man.
He can only use that long a sword if he can swing it from any position.

"What? It cannot be that this is the end. That invisible sword is not just mere show, is it not?"
"Hah, quit your impudent talk!"

The sword and the katana crash.
"All right, I am correct...!"
The longsword stops in empty space.
Assassin smiles and looks at his sword blocking the invisible sword, parries her sword, and
Saber defends herself from the blow to her neck.
"......!"
Even Saber knows.
That it is because of her invisible sword that she is able to block Assassin's unfamiliar techniques.
The invisible sword confuses the opponent's senses in both offense and defense.

That is why Assassin does not follow through too much.
As he does not know how long Saber's sword is, it is too dangerous for Assassin to close in on Saber.
If Assassin ever goes to attack Saber, that will be when

"Hah...!"
Saber tries to smash Assassin's head.
That blow....
...Is perfectly dodged by Assassin, who merely retreats a bit.

"...All right, I see it now. The blade is roughly three Shaku (ninety centimeters) long and four sun (twelve centimeters) wide. The shape is... hmmm... like your name, Saber, it is a typical western sword."
He talks calmly but it does not even need to be said how good his judgment is.
Saber's blows are too fast to perceive even if the sword can be seen.
But not only does he defend against the invisible sword, but he has figured out its shape

"I cannot believe it. You have measured my sword without using any magic nor exchanging blows with me."

"Oh, are you surprised? But this is just a street performance. As I am an unorthodox sword-user, I only improve on such techniques."

"I see. It was your way of fighting not to meet any of my blows, but parry them. I see the term unorthodox comes from how much of a coward you are."

"HaNo, no. Forgive my rudeness in not locking blades with you.
I have this longsword. It will break if I fight off your sword. It must be your style to compete in power, but I cannot do so. I cannot lock blades with you and compete strength with you."


"The Katana is always such a sword.
Western swords cut with their weight and power.
But our blades cut with speed and technique.
It is no wonder our fighting styles are mismatched, is it not?"

"But well... this is somewhat unentertaining.
Now is a good time, Saber. Stop hiding your true powers."
"...Assassin, are you saying I am going easy on you?"
"Are you saying you are not? I do not know your intentions, but you are taking me lightly fighting with your sheath on. Are you telling me that I am not worthy to fight seriously?"


"Hm. It still seems as if you will not comply with my request.
Fine, then this is it. If you are unwilling to do so, I will show you my secret technique first."
Saying so...
The swordsman with the longsword comes down next to Saber.

"What?"
To relinquish his advantage of being overhead is the same as losing for Assassin.
Assassin is certainly a skilled swordsman, but that is only with the conditions of these geographical features.

If they are to fight on the same level, it is possible for Saber to repel Assassin's attack and slash his neck.
But Assassin would know this as well.
So why?

"Be ready. Or you will die, Saber."
Saber's instincts react to that voice.
He's telling the truth.
It is not advantageous at all for Saber that Assassin has come down.
The instincts that have got her through numerous battles warn her of her misunderstanding.

"Ku!"
She readies her sword at once.
There is no time to hesitate.
She only has to attack with her sword before Assassin swings his longsword!

"Fu"
There's about three meters of distance between them.
With Saber trying to charge in, Assassin stands ready.
That...
...Is a stance that the swordsman has not yet shown in this battle.

"Secret technique"
Saber charges in.
The longsword is useless now.
As long as she's inside its range, its length will backfire.
But.
"Tsubame-Gaeshi"
Such logic does not exist with this swordsman.
The lightning strikes.
An evil strike that attacks with speed overwhelming Saber!

"!"
But it is not as if Saber cannot block such an attack.
She moves her attacking sword into defense, and she repels Assassin's full-power attack...!

"Got it...!"
Even Assassin will have an opening if that attack is repelled.
In the small instant where she tries to slice Assassin's stomach...
"Ah"
In that instant, Saber trusts her instincts and rolls down the stone steps.

She rolls down as if fleeing.
She doesn't even soften her landing.
Saber spins her body frantically and rolls down the stairs without killing her speed.

"Ku!"
Saber stops rolling and stands back up.
She stares at the swordsman standing calmly.

"Oh. You have dodged my secret technique. As expected of Saber, you are unlike the swallow."

"I do not believe it. That cannot be..."
"No, it is nothing much. It is just something I thought of when considering how to hit swallows."
He raises his longsword a little.
As ifto trace the movement of the technique that inspired fear in Saber.

"Can you see it, Saber?
Swallows avoid the sword by feeling the wind. It does not matter how fast your sword is. You cannot swing a sword without shaking the air, correct? The swallows feel this shaking and change their direction of flight.
So no one could kill the swallows with one blow, no matter what kind of blow it was. A sword is only a straight line after all. It is only natural for it to be unable to apprehend the swallow, which can move vertically and horizontally."

"Thus you only have to surround its escape route.
Use one blow to attack the swallow and use your second blow to catch the escaping swallow as it reads the wind.
But they are fast. The second blow cannot come in time with this longsword. If I wanted to get the swallows, I would have to do both attacks at about the same time. But such a thing is beyond human abilities.
I accepted such a thing was impossible, but

"Unfortunately, I had nothing else to do.
They say determination is key to success, but when I noticed, it was like this.
A worthless idea to kill a swallow became a secret technique that creates a prison with many slashes."

In her mind, Saber disagrees with Assassin's words.
It's wrong.
That technique is not as simple as that.
About the same time? No.
The two blows came at exactly the same time.
Assassin'sSasaki Kojirou's longsword doubled its existence for just that instant.

"Multi-dimensional refraction phenomenon... Kishua Zelretch... A Servant that has reached the level of a Noble Phantasm with mere skill"
That fact is what should be admired.
That one blow made it clear.
Sasaki Kojirou does not have a Noble Phantasm like heroic spirits have.
He has only his demonic technique, made possible by his god-like skill.
It is impossiblebut this mere human is equal to heroic spirits armed with Noble Phantasms!

"But the foothold was bad. The Tsubame-Gaeshi originally has three slashes. If this place were a bit wider, I could have added the vertical slash as well."
"...I would assume so. It would not be effective without that.
If everything is to happen at the same time, the second blow has to be slower. To compensate for that, there should be a third vertical attack, to prevent the opponent from dodging sideways."

"You catch on quickly. That must be why you were able to avoid my secret technique.
Hah, you are wonderful, Saber.
I have cursed myself for being summoned in this world, but that will end tonight. If I am able to battle someone I can fully use my secret attacks on, it is well worth being summoned"

Assassin readies his sword once again and comes down the stairs.
He must be after Saber's neck.
Saber is not confident if she will be able to avoid that secret technique again.
Like Lancer's Gae Bolg, Assassin's Tsubame-Gaeshi is something that cannot be allowed to begin.

No, unlike Gae Bolg, that allows you to find a countermeasure once you find out it will go for the heart, there are no possible counters for Assassin's secret technique even when you know about it.
If there is a countermeasure, it is only not to let him use it.
To beat it, she must attack him with her strongest blow before Assassin uses that technique

"...I see. Certainly, you are not someone I can go easy on."
She lowers her arms.
She lowers her sword as if to stick it into the ground. She glares at Assassin, who is approaching her.
"Hm...? So you are finally ready to do so?"

Assassin stops descending the steps and readies himself for a certain kill.
Saber looks at him bravely.
"I too have no complaints.
Will you be able to take my attack, Servant Assassin...!?"
Saber releases her own restraints.

The air shakes.
As if acting in response to her will, the sword erupts with a massive amount of wind.

"Mm!"
Assassin retreats a bit.
It is only natural as the wind pressure released from Saber is extraordinary.
Not only Assassin, but even the large firm trees of the forest are shaking and creaking.

It is a flow of wind like an explosion.
The trapped air is released and explodes outward.
This raging wind that would easily blow away a normal person is coming out from Saber's sword.

That is the power of her sword.
"Invisible Air" is a sword that has wind sealed in it.
The sword that covers itself in compressed wind changes the refraction of light to make it look invisible.
So this phenomenon occurs once the wind is released.
The released wind seeks escape and emits itself chaotically into the surroundings.

In that instant.
It is the commanding magic of the sword that allows her to freely manipulate the raging wind.
With Saber possessing incredible amounts of magical energy, she should be able to hold this boundary field for a few minutes.
As proof, her sword is still invisible even though she has already released this much wind.

"...Hm. It is like a typhoon, but"
The power of the raging wind does not abate.
The wind emitting from Saber's sword is about to engulf Assassin.

"It cannot be just this. I will find out what is behind all this, Saber...!"
Assassin closes in against the blinding raging wind.

Saber's arms move.
To attack Assassin who is calmly advancing in the strong wind that allows no approach, the sword clad in wind roars and
You thoughtless Shirou!
Thoughtless Shirou!!
What are you doing when her wound hasn't even healed yet?
You just became a Master, so you should train yourself a bit more!
That's right. It can't be helped if you're killed by me, but being killed by that fox isn't cool. Hurry back to the previous choice and stay home tonight.
That's right. Make sure to properly consider your actions next time.
Well. Tiger Dojo, the support for all those who reach dead ends because of mistakes, is entering its third session already.
I think you people are getting used to this dojo, but...
But? What is it, Taiga? Are you hinting at something? Is there something you want to say?
...Yes. Actually, I think everyone's starting to wonder by now as well.
Wonder?
Well, then I'll say it but
Isn't that buruma too direct!!!!!!?
Huh? But this is a dojo, right? I'm in my gym uniform because we're going to be working out.
...I see. So that's the reason, huh? That's certainly logical. I thought it was a scheme of a mischievous girl trying to steal away the few spotlights I have.
You're thinking too much, Taiga. After all, we're on a completely different level. I don't even need to change into my best clothes.
You're right! We're treated differently, so there's isn't even a need to compete.
Thank God. We're best friends forever.
The gym uniform is a sign of vitality, so I'll allow Ilya-chan to keep wearing it!
Of course. Well, you can thank me for not being in a maid costume or a school swimsuit. Actually, I was supposed to appear in a different costume every time.
Wow. An obvious difference in our treatment.
Heh, I'm not vexed. The idea was discarded after all, so you're treated the same way as I am.
...But I'm a bit curious.
What kind of costumes were you planning to wear?
Um, things like male school uniform, kamakura style, my adult version, snowman, apron, kimono, G*rman army officer's uniform...
There were forty different costumes!
Guaaaaa! That's enough! Such blessed love is too hateful!
But it's a bit disappointing since I wanted to see the officer uniform.
Yeah. I don't think it's good to take back a decision they've already made, even though they're adults.
You're right! What are the commanders thinking to take away my route!? Do they really want to win!?
You had no route from the start.
What!? Stay there, you disgrace!
Kyaaaaa, heeeeelp meeeee.
Oh, hi, Senpai.
Stay relaxed.
She's gone... Taiga's unconscious, so maybe I should head back too.
Give you the stamp and... all right, let's meet again after the next dead end!

If I can, I'd prefer nobody to be sad.
If I can make people around me happy just by helping them myself, I think that would make the world a pleasant place to live in.

That was Kiritsugu's favorite phrase.
The man who was a superhero to me was saying that he thought he was a failure.

He didn't even need to explain it to me.
The world of the young me was so different from the world of the adult Kiritsugu that the passing grade to be a superhero was different.
For me as a child, the house was my only world.
So it was enough for me if I could keep protecting my father, Fuji-Nee, myself, and the shed that I loved.

I only tried to protect the ones I could see.
But maybe Kiritsugu wanted to do something about even the ones he couldn't see.

I was reckless when I was young.
I educated myself by cursing the heartlessness of the world.
The world was cruelso I made myself even more heartless and used that as a weapon, trying to follow through on my ideals.

There will always be some that cannot be saved.
It is impossible to save everyone.
If I have to lose five hundred to earn one thousand,I will abandon one hundred and save the lives of nine hundred.
That is the most efficient method.
That is the idealKiritsugu once said that.

Of course, I got mad.
I really got mad.
Because I knew that without being told.
Because I myself was saved like that.

I don't even need to be told something as obvious as that.
But stillI believed that someone would be a superhero if they saved everyone even though they think like that.
It may be an idealistic thought or an impossible pipe dream, but a superhero is someone who tries to save everyone in spite of that.

You're right, Shirou.
The result is the most important thing. But with that aside, your heart trying to do so is

Oh yeah, Kiritsugu said something about the heart.
...I can't remember too well.
After all, it's rare for me to remember something from such a long time ago.
I must be in a deep sleep.
That must be true, as it's rare for me to dream at all.

Shirou, please wake up. It is almost time for breakfast.

See.
As proof, I am in the shameful situation of Saber having to wake me up

"What?"
I raise myself from the futon.
It's six thirty. Bright sunlight shines in from outside.
"It is morning, Shirou. Are you not going to be preparing breakfast?"
In front of me is Saber's discontented face.

"I slept in. I'll get up right away."
"...I do not think there is any need to apologize to me, but it is true that you do not have time to take it easy. It seems Sakura and Rin were arguing earlier."
"Sakura and Tohsaka arguing...?"

What's that about?
Hold on, don't get me cornered into an incomprehensible situation right when I get up.

"Is that in Tohsaka's room?"
"No, it is in the living room. I only passed by, so I do not know the details."
"All right. I'll hurry."

Oh.
I have something I need to do before that.
"...? What is it Shirou?"
"Good morning, Saber. Thanks for waking me up."
I greet her, then I really make my way to the hallway.
...But arguing with Sakura, what's Tohsaka doing!?

"Tohsaka!"
I run into the living room.
...There.
There's no sign of Sakura in the living room, and Tohsaka is watching the weather forecast by herself.

"Morning. You seem agitated, calling my name first thing in the morning."
She turns around as if asking me what's going on.

"...?"
That's weird. It doesn't seem like she's been arguing with Sakura....

"Yeah, morning. ...Hey, Tohsaka. I heard you were arguing with Sakura, is that true?"

"Huh? ...I see, you must have heard it from Saber.
Yes, you could say that looking at it objectively, but it wasn't really anything. I just told her not to come here for a while."

"!"
Is that something you can say easily!?
She means she made Sakura stop coming here, right!?

"That's ridiculous. Sakura refused before already. There's no way Sakura would agree, even if you asked her again"

"It might not be possible, but she went home once I offered her terms. I said I'd go back home if she doesn't come here for a week. That established a negotiation between us. She reluctantly went home. Oh yeah, she gave her best regards to you."

"Best regards... you"
She did something so selfish without telling me

...No, I'm wrong.
Tohsaka was just doing something I should have done already.

"I see. I'm sorry that I made you do something so troubling this early in the morning. You must be feeling bad, Tohsaka."
"...? No, it wasn't hard nor unpleasant. Why do you say that?"

"Well, you were friends with Sakura. So you probably didn't want to tell Sakura head on to get out of here.
That's why I'm apologizing. I should've been firm, but I caused you trouble again."

"T-That's fine. I just drove out Sakura for my own safety. There's no reason for you to apologize to me."
"...? Your safety?"

"Shinji is a Master, right?
Knowing him, he would be angry at you if he found out Sakura was at your house. So it's best not to have Sakura here until we settle things with Shinji."

"Oh"
...I see.
She's right now that she mentions it.
I don't think Shinji was lying when he said he wouldn't tell Sakura anything.
But having his sister Sakura here might give him the wrong idea.

"...Right. It looks like we were holding Sakura hostage against Shinji."

"Exactly. And that aside, it's true that this place is dangerous.
We can't let her walk around at night, so it's best to have her stay calm for a while. It's for Sakura's sake and our sake."

"...Yeah, you're right. I feel sorry for Sakura, but I'll apologize later and have her forgive me."
But I won't be able to tell her why even when that time comes.

"Man."
It's really getting to me.
It's depressing that I've rejected Sakura, who comes to help me all the time, like this.

"Oh, you're so dispirited. What happened to the power that made you scream at me? Is Emiya-kun so lonely without Sakura?"

Tohsaka makes an evil face.
...Crap. I knew she would make fun of me if I showed weakness, and now I've done it.

"...Leave me alone. Anyways, Sakura was a symbol of peace at my house. She supplied something that was missing with just Fuji-Nee and me. But I sent her away for my convenience, so yes, it's depressing."

"Oh, you do understand. You pass if you can say that. It seems you're getting more determined to win."
"...? W-What are you trying to say, Tohsaka?"

"Don't you get it? I'm saying that Sakura will return once the fight is over.
You say you don't need the Holy Grail, but you could fight to keep the peace you have now. See, it's good to have a clear goal."
Tohsaka says so with a big smile.


If she puts it like that, I can only agree.
...Geez, how should I say this?
Once again, I realize that this person is both infinitely ill-natured and really great.

"Whaaat? Then Sakura-chan won't be coming here for a while?"
"Yeah, so why don't you go back home and give your parents a treat? Your father was complaining that his daughter didn't care about him."

"I can leave my dad alone. He won't die even if I'm not there.
And I have to be firm if Sakura-chan isn't here. You're a boy, so if something happens, you'll get a disciplinary dismissal. Can you take responsibility in that case?"

"That won"
Unfortunately, man's nature does not let me declare that it "won't happen".

"...Emiya-kun? What was that pause?"
She glares.
Tohsaka's stare is painful.
"I don't think that's going to happen. This isn't a normal stay.
I know that."

"I see. Good, Emiya-kun is indeed trustworthy, Sensei."
"Of course. Shirou is so calm that it makes me think I've gone too far with my tastes."
Tohsaka smiles while Fuji-Nee puffs with pride.

"......"
Saber silently watches them while eating.
...This is only the second day, but I don't think I'll ever get used to this atmosphere.

"Oh yeah, Shirou. It's about the archery club, but did you know that Mitsuzuri-san got injured?"
"Mitsuzuri? What? Did she get in a fight with someone again? Geez, she's almost a third year, so she should calm down a little.
...So, how's the injury? Is it bad?"

"It's fine. It was a light sprain. It seems she was attacked by a molester on her way home.
She's fast, right? She ran away quickly, but injured herself when she fell over at the end."

"...I see. Thank God it was nothing serious. But a molester attacking her... he must be reckless or have discerning tastes.
Either way, he was a stupid molester. I thought..."
"You thought she knocked him out instead of running away, right?"
Fuji-Nee smiles.
Indeed, she knows Mitsuzuri Ayako well.

"Yeah. It's rare for her to run away.
But... I see, even Mitsuzuri is weak against molesters. I guess that's good. It's impossible to teach her femininity unless something like this happens."
Approving, I eat the well-cooked rice.

"Hey, Emiya-kun."
Then.
Tohsaka Rin pats my shoulder with a smile.

"Should I tell you something interesting too?"
"...? What? There isn't much that's more interesting than what I just heard."

"Yeah. I haven't mentioned it, but Ayako and I are good friends. Did you know we're friends who hang out together on weekends?"
Hold on.
Why... are she... and Ayako... good friends?

"Huh?"
"Don't worry, I will tell her the exact words of this conversation. If I tell her you're happy, I bet she'll be so happy that she'll break about ten roof tiles."

"I would like to correct myself. I just used the wrong words. It's not something to tell other people about, so it would really help me out if you kept quiet about it."

"Is that so? I can keep it a secret, but it might be hard unless there are some conditions on that. You see, it could just slip out, you know?"
"...Hey now. It's not good to smile when you're saying something modest."

"Oh, I'm sorry. It's not like I'm having fun, so don't misunderstand."
Oh no, I understand.
You really are having fun.

"...I get it. I'll make the breakfasts Western-style from now on.
...I now feel like accepting your request that breakfast should be toast."

"Good. I'll be happy if you remember to use strawberry jam and not just marmalade."
"...Sigh. What do you think a Japanese morning is? You're a tyrant, changing breakfast to suit your own selfish tastes."

"No, that is incorrect. I too am happy for breakfast to be bread. It would be perfect if soft-boiled eggs are prepared as well."
...And Saber adds her opinion.

"Fine. All right, I'll make Western-style breakfast, okay? You guys are on a roll just because Sakura makes Western-style food.
I'll start making Western-style breakfasts starting tomorrow, so you guys will have no complaints, right? And that conversation's a secret. Don't tell Mitsuzuri about it."

I look away from the two with a humph and start eating.
...And then.
"Why are you doing something so pointless?"
Fuji-Nee, who has watched our conversation with wonder, murmurs.

"...What? What do you mean pointless, Fuji-Nee?"
"Cause I'll tell Mitsuzuri-san even if Tohsaka-san doesn't. I can't keep quiet about something like that."
Fuji-Nee eats after nodding that it's a problem.
"......"
...No.
I have to come up with some countermeasure real soon or I'll really lose my position....

Breakfast ends and it's now seven-thirty.
It's rare, but Fuji-Nee is still at the house and suggests with a smile that we should go to school together.


...But I can't do that.
The decision last night.
As long as I said I would fight without relying on Saber, I can't be so easygoing.
If I have to put any extra time into fighting, I don't have time for school.

"Then let's go. Is the house locked up, Shirou?"
"No, that's fine. I'm going to skip school today."
I raise my hand in goodbye and see Tohsaka and Fuji-Nee off.

Fuji-Nee freezes for a few seconds and...
"Hey, what do you mean you're skipping school!?"
"Huh, what?"
It seems Tohsaka said something Fuji-Nee wanted to say.

"T-That's right, Shirou. There's nothing wrong with you to make you skip school, right?"
"No, my wound hurts. Old wounds hurt when the temperature goes down, right? It's kind of like that."

"Hm... That's a lie, right Shirou?"
"It's a lie, but let me go with it. It's not that I don't want to go to school. I have something I have to do, and it's just that it's more important right now. So please let me go."

"...Geez. I lose if you have to put it like that. You're always like this when you can't tell me about things. You were like that as a child."
It seems Fuji-Nee understands, even though she's complaining.

"So that's that. I'll leave the school to you. Is that okay, Tohsaka?"
"...I see. Well, it doesn't matter for me if Emiya-kun comes or not. This isn't a bad choice."

"Yeah, leave the house to me. I'll skip work for a while too, so I won't leave the house much."
"...All right, Then I'll be off, Shirou. You're absent from school because of an injury, so don't leave the house much."
"See you. ...It's fine this time, but ask me about things like this beforehand next time."
Dinner ends.
I think it was a normal dinner table for everyone except me.
As for me, I couldn't even sense the taste with the scene in the dressing room flickering in my mind.

"...It's cold."
I opened the window by the porch and I was cooling my head off, but I'm done with that.
I'll catch a cold if I keep doing this.

"Shirou, you were here."
"S-Saber...!? W-What? Is there some business?"
"I believe you have one and not me. I thought you were to learn magic from Rin at night."

"Oh."
I hit my head.
"I totally forgot. Thanks, I'll go right away!"

I run into the outbuilding and go to the second floor.
I knock on the door of the guest room that Tohsaka occupies.
"Shirou? It's fine. I don't have my hands free at the moment, so just come on in."
Tohsaka's voice comes back, somehow without composure.

As soon as I enter the room, I see Tohsaka doing something weird.
Tohsaka has something like a jewel in her hand, a syringe in the other hand, and a handkerchief in her mouth.

"Can I ask, Tohsaka?"
"Folf on. I'll fe fone fife fofei's fife fith."

Saying that, Tohsaka puts the needle into her arm.
...She draws blood out of herself.
And taking the blood, she drips it one drop at a time onto the jewel, and grasps the bloody jewel.

Something like dizziness passes by.
I am barely able to tell that it's the light of magical energy, but

"...Sigh. Only three tenths after this much. I guess I'll have to do with the nine I have."
Tohsaka slumps her shoulders and puts the stone back into some kind of a jewelry box.

"Tohsaka, I'm here for your lesson, as promised."
But first, I'm curious about what she was doing.

"Yeah, I was waiting. You were training your body with Saber during the day, right? Then you should train what's inside during the night."

Tohsaka seems happy as she's more than ready to teach.
...Hmm. Saber said she wasn't any good at teaching, but I bet this one's the complete opposite.
No, putting that aside...

"Well, what should we start with? I think you were saying you can only use the strengthening magic"
"Actually, could I ask you something before that? I'm curious.
What were you just doing? It's dangerous to use needles on yourself."

"Oh, that? I was just making magic bullets. The magics of my family are flow and conversion of power. So when I have enough to spare, I transfer my magical energy somewhere else."
Tohsaka concludes the conversation, leaving me way behind.

"Hold on. What do you mean by magic bullet and transferring magical energy?"

"Magic bullets are magic bullets. It's a bullet filled with magical energy.
Haven't you ever heard that people's thoughts tend to go into jewels? In practice, jewels are easy targets to transfer magical energy into, but it seems my family is even more compatible with it than most."

"Transferring magical energy... well, for example, you have excess strength left over if you do nothing for the whole day, right? I'm storing that excess power in the jewels.
You keep on doing this for days, months, and years, and that turns the jewels themselves into 'magic'."

"But then, the jewels have limited capacities and I cannot control magical energy outside me.
The magical energy inside the jewels is just an ignition to instantly activate a large-scale magic."

"...? Um, so you're putting your magical energy into the jewels as a backup?"
"Backup...? Hmm, close but not quite. I'm just filling up a single-use disposable backpack."

"So you mean you're temporarily expanding the hard disk... that's amazing. So you should be able to use as much magic as you want."

"Hard disk...? I don't know what you're talking about, but it's not that useful. The magical energy I put into the jewel is dyed in that jewel's attribute, so its uses become limited."

"...I see. But I'm surprised. I didn't know you could save up magical energy like that.
Why don't other magi do something so useful?"
Well, saying that, the only other magus I know is Kiritsugu.

"The ability to store magical energy in something outside yourself is unique.
Even your strengthening is putting magical energy into something, right? Normally, whatever you put magical energy into changes in some way and uses up that magical energy. The effect of magic is instantaneous and not permanent, right?"

"So my family does it in a way that isn't instantaneous, and we cleverly put magical energy into the jewel so that it's permanent, but... other magi can do the same thing with their bodies.
That's the Magic Crestthe magic backup that all magi have."

"Magic Crest... oh, you mean the secret that a parent hands down to their child. I don't understand too well since I don't have one."

"Wait. What did you just say?"
"Huh...? Well, I said I don't have this Magic Crest thing. I think Father had one, but he never gave it to me."


Tohsaka gasps, and then nods to herself.

"No wonder you're an amateur. ...So you're really doing things from the very beginning... yeah, then I guess it can't be helped," she murmurs to herself.

"...Tohsaka. Haven't you realized that I don't have a Magic Crest?"

"No way. I wouldn't have let you go out by yourself if I'd known. Well, it's true that I thought you were unskilled, but if you don't have a Magic Crest, you're not even a magus."

She gives me a complaining look with a "hmph".
But what is it?
Her words have a warmness that sounds like relief, and it sounds as if she's envious that I'm not a magus.

"Oh well. In that case, I'll explain things to you from the very beginning. Understanding the Magic Crest means understanding magi.
All right, you sit there. It's an important lesson, so listen up."

"Here's fine? ...All right, go ahead."
I look into Tohsaka's eyes with determination.
She must appreciate my seriousness, as she nods in satisfaction.

"Then I'll start off with something simple.
You know that magical energy is what you need to use magic, right? You can actually refer to anything that can activate magic as 'magical energy'.
There's an infinite variety of magical energy.
There are some that perform magic using their force of will, and there are some that that use magic by paying a price other than themselves.
You know this much, right?"

"Yeah. You mean the 'mana' (large source) and the 'odo' (small source), right? The large source is the magical energy in the world that fills nature. The small source is the magical energy that people can create themselves."
"That's right, well done. Then, let's start with magic that uses the large source.

"Okay. Magi that lack an accumulated lineage of magi... like you, Shirou... use something that already has form to make magical energy.
This is a method established as a process in ancient times, using offerings and rituals to make contact with the divine mystery.

"They prepare a price to pay since their powers are not sufficient. This is called the formal craft.
This way, magic can be activated even if the caster's magical energy is sparse. This is because the magical energy used comes not from the caster but from somewhere else, so the caster only needs to perform the ritual."

"...But, well, you can't do it if you don't have the knowledge. It's impossible for you right now, and anyway, such a bloody method doesn't suit you."

"...Right. I also don't want to sacrifice a chicken or spend the whole evening praying in a magic circle."

"Right?
Then putting that aside, next is the small source. So in other words, magic that is cast using the magi's own power.
I don't think I need to explain, but this is the basic use of magic for someone like you and me.
Your 'strengthening' is a magic that relies on your own Magic Circuit, not on borrowing anyone else's power, right?"

I nod.
It seems the conversation is going into the main point.

"Well, the function that creates magical energy for youthe 'Magic Circuit' is a hereditary constitution that is passed down the ancestral lineage of magi.
The Magic Circuit is trained over many generations, and passed on to the descendants, becoming more powerful.
The child of a magi lineage is already fit to use magic just because of that. It's not fair, but it means we're different from the start."

"I know that. I don't care, so you can continue on."
"I don't really care either, but....
Oh well. Anyways, other than this Magic Circuit, there is also a secret magic that the family trains over the generations."

"It's kind of like that jewel earlier. Once one masters a magic, a magus can 'put their hands on' that magic.
Do you know the feeling of 'putting your hands on' a magic that is naturally just formulas and has no shape?"

"I don't know, but I assume it's like it's part of your body if you can put your hands on it."

"Exactly.
The magic that goes beyond the level of formulas and becomes part of yourself can be left in a form.
It is a great deed that establishes an unstable magic, and at the same time, it is proof that the magus existed."

"And the magus, on the verge of death, hands down this great accomplishment in a crest. Like saying 'I give you this to reach the realms I could not reach, perhaps this crest I will give you might offer some help'.
...Well, the one handing it down and the one receiving both know the crest is of no help, though."

"...? What? It's such a great crest, and yet it's useless?"

"It is useful! If you're a normal magus, it's so useful that that one crest will provide you ease and comfort!
...But, well, it's like inheriting a car. No matter how fast you can travel on the ground, you can never reach the moon."
"...?"

"It doesn't matter, so let's get back to the topic at hand.
I think you already know by now, but this crest is the Magic Crest."

"The head of the family puts the magic he devoted his life to into that crest and passes it on, and the descendant completes another magic increasing the crest, and passes it on again.
It grows more complex like that, and a deep history is engraved into it. That's the Magic Cresta chain that the magus cannot free themselves from."

"...So... everything about that family is recorded in the Magic Crest?"

"Oh, that's wrong. The record of the family is naturally left on paper. Only magic is in the Magic Crest.
It can cast spells automatically and allow you to use magics that you have not acquired yet.
To put it simply, it's like carving a magic circle onto your body."

"...Hm. Then doesn't that mean you can carve the crest on anyone? You can draw a magic circle as many times as you want if you know the shape of it."

"That's not the way it works.
The Magic Crest is like a living thing. It's almost like transplanting organs.
There's usually only one of an organ, so you can't give it away to numerous people or make copies of it.
There's no point in dividing the heart into two, right? Even if you separate it, it just stops functioning."

"Oh... hm. I see, you're right. Then you had that crest transplanted into you too?"

"...I guess the term transplant was a bad example. Actually, it's no different from a tattoo.
In my case, it's on my left arm from my shoulder to my hand. But the Magic Crest won't show up unless I use it, so there's no need to hide it unlike the Command Spell."

"...So, well, that's why a family of magi is succeeded by only one descendant.
If the family happens to produce brothers or sisters, it is common for the rest of them to live normally without learning about magic. Since you can't give them the Magic Crest, there's not much point even if they succeed as a magus."

"Yeah, Shinji was saying that too. ...I see, so that's why they didn't teach Sakura."

"Yes. ...But the inheritance of the crest itself stopped a few generations ago in the Matou family. So I assume Shinji was only taught knowledge of magic.
...Really, that type are the most troubling. They can't feel magic, but they still try to use it."
Cursing in a disappointed manner, Tohsaka takes a deep breath.

"Well, I was supposed to teach you magic, but the plan's changed. I'll have to come up with a different plan if you don't have a Magic Crest.
...Yeah, let's call it quits for tonight. I'll prepare some things for tomorrow, so please wait until then."

"...? I can only agree, but... what do you mean by preparing some things?"

"Just some things. If you don't have a crest, you can't switch, right? We're going to tamper inside your body, so we need drugs and medical tools and things."


Whoa. I really felt a chill there.

"What? I'll stop if you don't want to. But in that case, there'll be nothing I can teach you."
"Uh... no, I don't want to, but please. You're probably correct."

...Well, I don't know what she meant by the word switch, but I think the fact that I can't do so is related to the fact that I always fail when trying to turn myself into a Magic Circuit.

"Then tomorrow's plan's decided.
...Oh yeah, are you going to be training with Saber again tomorrow?"

"...? Yeah. I'm also worried about the boundary field at school, but there's still time until it's activated. I want to be able to fight at least a bit by then."

"Well, that's fine. But it seems you aren't getting along with Saber too well in spite of that."
"Ugh... that's, uh..."

"You guys were talking normally before dinner, but you've been silent since dinnertime.
I'm asking to make sure, but everything's all right between you two, right? If you guys disagree during a battle, I'm going to suffer as well."

...Ugh.
It's just that there was a small thing before dinner, and it's just a bit awkward.
That's all... but are things really all right between me and Saber?
Well, I think I know a bit about Saber, having trained with her all today.

I can trust Saber as an ally.
That's absolute.
But if you ask me how I think of her beyond that, I can't readily answer.
First of all, I...
All my proper emotions were stolen away at that instant.

"...That's a difficult question. How about you, Tohsaka? Do you like Saber?"

"I like her. There's no reason not to like her.
She's strong, well-mannered, and beautiful. She's so different from my cynical guy."
"I see, so you like Saber."

"! What? I just said she's the kind of person I like. Y-You should stop saying things so directly. You'll make more enemies that way."

"I refuse. I hate being indirect like you, and I'm a poor talker by nature."

"...I assumed so. You don't seem like the kind to be sarcastic or cynical. Yeah, I bet you think of me as a loud annoying person, right?"

"...? Why? I like the way you say things. It wouldn't seem like you if you weren't like that."
"!"
Oh.
Tohsaka looks away from me unpleasantly. I might have angered her.

"......"
Well, beyond that, I'm a bit happy right now since Tohsaka said she likes Saber.
"Well, I should at least wash the floor."
I already told Saber to come here in a little while.
I always do the minimum cleaning necessary, but it's been a few years since I last had a contest with someone.
It'd be impolite to the dojo and Saber if I don't at least clean the floor.

"...But man. I wonder what she'll make me do."

I've fought Kiritsugu a few times with shinais, but neither of us considered form and it was more like amateurs beating each other up.
I never intended to take kendo seriously, and I was only taught what to do if an opponent had a long weapon.

"...Anyways, I wasn't good at using things to fight. I'm only interested in making and fixing."

In that regard, this is the first time I will be seriously studying swordsmanship.
It seems Saber's style is different from kendo, but it should have some similarities and it shouldn't be so confusing that I can't follow it.

I hear the door.
Saber must have arrived on time.
That's good, as I just finished cleaning too.

"Sorry to keep you waiting. I'll be learning here starting today"
"...? What is it, Shirou? You look like you're surprised at something."

"Ohwell, I'm surprised because you're still in those clothes. I thought you'd be in the other outfit."
We're training with swords and my image of Saber fighting is in that armor, so I selfishly imagined that.

"I see. If you wish for me to be armed, I can be. ...You are correct, I was not thinking.
Even though it is only a match, it is impolite to Shirou not to wear my armor. I am sorry, I will change right away."

It seems Saber has come up with a solution on her own too.
"Ohno, that's not it. It's fine, it was just a misunderstanding. If you ask me, I prefer this outfit to the armor."

"Huh...? But this appearance does not satisfy you, right?"
"Satisfy... well, it certainly doesn't look like we're going to be having a match now, but it shouldn't be a problem if that's easy to move in. You'd get tired too if you wear that armor."

"That is true, butis it not strange for me to use a sword with this appearance?"
"Why? It looks good on you, so there's nothing strange about it.
I think you look better in that than the armor."

"...? I fail to understand. These clothes are certainly light, but they would not be able to withstand a fight. I believe this outfit is unsuitable for a Saber."
"Don't fight in that outfit, stupid. You're a girl. And those clothes suit girls, so it's fine."

Well.
I put the rag I was using into the bucket and take two shinais down from the wall.

"Well. So what kind of training should we be doing? I'll let you decide, so you can give me anything."
I toss a shinai to Saber.

Saber catches the shinai as if she's distracted, and looks at me.

"...? What? We can't use shinai?
D-Don't tell me to use solid wood swordsno, real swords!"
What a Spartan! That's well beyond what I expected.

"Ahno, there's no need for that. Since these are excellent imitation swords for matches, let us use them."
Saber takes a deep breath quietly.
And she's back to her usual self.

"Thank God. It's too dangerous to fight with solid wood swords.
...So, what should I do? Will we start with strength building exercises like swinging the sword five hundred times or running?"

"I do not think there is any need for that. Even from what I've seen, your strength is up to standards. If you wish to train your body even more, that would not be possible in a day or two.

"You are unskilled as a magus, but I do not think you are that bad as a warrior. You must have trained hard from a young age."
"Uhwell, it was the only thing I was good at. You can train your body even if you don't have talent as a magus."

"That must be good fortune. The result of your effort was not dying when Lancer attacked you."

"But it is not something that you can rely on.
Humans have limits. Your body is a long way from those limits and it would be difficult to overcome them anyway.
So the only thing I will be teaching you is fighting."

"...? What do you mean 'just fighting'? From the way you said it, it doesn't sound like you'll be teaching me how to fight."

"Of course not. Battle techniques cannot be acquired overnight. The only thing I can do is have my Master experience as many battles as possible.
In the first place, I am not good at teaching, so it would only be troubling if you asked for my guidance."

"Uh, hello?"
When she says that so proudly, as a student, I don't know how to reply.

"...Um, so. In short, we're just going to fight?"
"Yes. That is it, Master.
No stopping our hits, and let us fight as if trying to kill each other.
...Let me see... I believe you will understand what it is like in about an hour."

Saber lightly grips the shinai, ready to start.
"...?"
Still not understanding, I follow Saber's example and grab the shinai.
As soon as I do so.
The world turns upside down.

In short, Saber is only trying to teach me one thing.
The truth, that no matter what I do,no matter what scheme I come up with,I cannot ever beat someone I have no chance against.

"AHaa, haa, haa... owouch, ouch, this is broken, I'm sure...!"

"It would be more swollen if it were broken. It is a bad bruise, but it should heal quickly for you."
"...Uh, I see. All right, then let's continue a bit more."

"Eh... are we going to continue, Shirou?
It is indeed only a bruise, but it is not something you can move immediately."

"What are you saying when you're the one beating my arm mercilessly?
All right, if you're not up to it, I'll take this"
Opening!
...It doesn't work, of course.

"Please listen to me. You are definitely fatigued. Training will be useless in such a state, so we should take a rest."

"But... it's shameful to be beaten so badly when you're going easy on me.
I have to at least make you raise a brow or something, or I'll be too vexed to collapse."

"If you ask for surprise, I am already more than surprised. I thought you were stubborn, but I did not believe that it was to this extent."
"Sorry. I just hate losing."

"Yes, I understand well enough now. Anyways, we will take a break, so please put down your shinai.
The floor is slippery with sweat. We are not imitating a fight in an extreme situation. And it is meaningless to fight in such a fatigued condition."

"...Why? Battle practice usually assumes the worst situation, right? Then..."

"That is even more meaningless.
Listen, Shirou. If you say you are going to fight a Servant, it will be meaningless unless you have full power, the best ground, and an escape route prepared.
You cannot even be a match to a Servant unless everything is perfect. You have already made a mistake when you decide to fight a Servant in a poor condition."

"...Ugh. So you mean never fight in this kind of a situation no matter what?"
"That is correct. If that happens, no miracle will be able to save you, Shirou.
Your battle starts with perfecting your condition and finding the perfect situation."

"...I understand. Then I'm sorry, but let me take a rest."
I lean against the wall and slide down.

"Phew"
I let out the air collected in my lungs.
It should be air, but it's burning hot.

"...Ow."
While my body is burning with pain, I glance at the clock.
It's past eleven.
We started around nine, so that means we've been doing this for about two hours.

The first hour was just me getting beat up.
Saber's blows would suddenly strike me and I'd faint slightly.
I'd wake up, and just when I thought I'd be careful next time, I'd be knocked out again.
Anyways, I was beaten up repeatedly. It may be because my body got used to it or my power came out from anger, but I can now manage to block the first blow.

And the problem was after that.
Well, after being shown such a skill difference, can a human readily attack back?

"...You demon."
The answer is, I get knocked out the instant I shrink back.
After that it is like a mouse cornered by a cat.

If I am to be knocked out no matter how I block a blow, all I can do is get desperate and attack.
But of course, it's easily deflected and I'm knocked out. But when I get used to that as well...
"Oh dammit."
I start to gain the composure to think something like that, and the instincts that let me understand I'll be dead the next second become keener.
People usually call this being in the zone.

So then, I frantically went into defense.
The instincts that tell me "I'll be knocked out if that blow hits" come at me in numbers. So as a living being, it's only natural for me to avoid it.

I would manage to elude Saber's barrage of attacks, but I would take a fatal blow while I'm waiting for an opening to counter.
And I'd stand up and think that I can manage longer this time. From time to time, I would attack thinking it'd be best to attack if I'm doomed anyway.

The two hours were just spent repeating that process over and over.
...I don't know if I can get any stronger doing this.
I think this is just a match to help me get used to fighting.

So that I won't panic or get too relaxed in front of my enemy.
I'm just teaching my body that it is always one mistake away from death.

But stillif you ask me if this is meaningless, it is not.
As I have no weapons, I believe this tension is the thing I have to value the most.

"Well done. Are you hurt anywhere, Shirou?"

Before I realize it, Saber is right beside me.
I'm so sweaty that I'm dripping onto the floor, but Saber is not even sweating.

"It's harder to find a part that's not hurting.
...You were really merciless, Saber. If things are this one-sided, it's actually more refreshing."
I'll be honest here. 100 percent of this is me being a poor loser.

"Yes. I adjusted to your level, but tried to show you no mercy. It would not be a battle if I allowed myself the luxury of consideration."

"Right. Thanks to that, I can now calmly deal with an unchained Doberman.
...Though, it's not good enough if it's just a Doberman. I guess I still need more training."

I review my actions.
I thought I trained my body to be above average, but it's pitiful for me to give up after only two hours of fighting with Saber.

"No, that is not true. Your attacks were made with all your heart and they were powerful. Sometimes, I forgot to deal with them because you were so enthusiastic."
She's admiring needless things with gentle eyes.

"!"
My embarrassment suddenly returns.
Until now, we were just people fighting without any notion of boy or girl, butisn't this kind of a surprise attack?

"Hold on. I'm going to go get some water."
"Water? Then I will go get some for you, so please rest here."
Saber goes to get me some water.

"Phew, I'm saved."
...So.
Just what am I saved from...?

I drink the water Saber has brought me.
It must still be rest time as Saber is sitting in a polite Japanese-style.

...I think Saber is really beautiful like that.
I'm not thinking she's beautiful from a man's perspective, but I feel she is beautiful in everyone's eyes.

She has melted into the dignified atmosphere of the dojo, and has a quietness free of any conflicts.
There is an incongruity when such a girl is a Servant and showing such willingness to fight.


Right now, only Saber and I are here.
This is a good time to ask her something, so

1) Her reason for fighting. I want to know why she seeks the Holy Grail.
2) I want to know about Saber before she became a Servant.
3) I want a secret attack. A super move would be great.
The day ends.
I feel uneasy with Saber sleeping next to me, so I escape to the shed once again.

"......"
I stop walking and stare at the winter sky.
It's not that it's exceptionally beautiful.
It just calms me when I blankly feel the coldness of the winter.

I don't know how long I did so.
But I feel like I hear footsteps from within the darkness.
"Who is it?"
There's no reply.
But the footsteps come closer along with a sharp presence.

"...!"
I lower my waist and prepare so that I can jump back anytime.
"Hey. I'm asking, who is it?"
...There's no reply.
The cause of the footsteps appears in front of me without stopping.


He says nothing but glances at me.
"You're"
He's the Servant that was fighting Lancer that night at school.
The red-armored knight that Saber beat after she jumped over the wall

"You're Tohsaka's Servant, Archer...?"
The man raises the sides of his mouth a bit.
He smiledso, can I take that as affirmation?


...Something annoys me.
I feel irritated for no reason, or I should say, I can't get myself to like this guy.
I've never talked with him nor has he attacked me.
But still, I understand the moment I see him face on.

I cannot approve of him.
There's no reason for it, but I just can't like him.
It's just not me. It should be the same for Archer.
There can't be three people in this world who match me so badly.
He's someone like that to me, so it'll be no surprise if he considers me irritating as well.

"...What? Weren't you going to confine yourself to keeping watch until your injury healed?"
"Of course, I intend to do so. I will end this ridiculous cooperation once my wound heals. That is why I have remained as a spectator, believing that I have nothing to tell you."
"Oh, don't hold back and stay as a spectator. I don't have anything to talk to you about either."

"As much as I'd like to do so, there's something I cannot overlook.
It seems you are not letting Saber fight."
"What's wrong with that?"
I automatically answer him back.


With clear enmity, Archer glares at me.

"...As I thought. It is indeed something a kid like you would think.
There's no need for help from others. I can do everything myself.
And on top of that, there can't be any victims, huh? I'm disgusted with that attitude of yours."

"What...!? You have no reason to tell me that!
I'm just going to do what I believe is right. You have no reason to complain...!"

"I have a reason. As a Servant just like her, I can understand Saber's troubles. Saber must bear a large burden with a Master like you."

"...!"
Partly because what he said is true.
But even more than that, I cannot stand having this guy say it.

"Don't kid me...! I'm not a burden to Saber! I'm going to fight in her place, so that should be fine!"

"Heh, are you saying she won't get hurt if she doesn't fight? Servants are beings that only exist to fight. It is an insult to deny fighting to such a beingbut telling you that won't do any good."
After saying what he wants, Archer closes his mouth.

For a few minutes, Archer and I confront each other silently.

I gulp.
His cold stare seems to be looking inside me.

And suddenly.
"So. How shall it be, Saber's Master?"
The red knight calmly requests an answer.

"What do you mean?"
"Do you really intend to finish this war without fighting? Not fighting anyone, not killing anyone, and not letting anyone be killed?"
"...I didn't say I won't fight. I'll fight when the time comes."

"I see. So you won't kill anyone even if you fight?"
"That's right. You have a problem with that?"
"I won't interfere with your overly optimistic thinking. I don't have the time, and I am not that crazy."
Archer turns his back.

"But do not misunderstand. The superhero you are being is no more than a cleaner. Know that the only people you can save like that are the ones that survive."

...I wonder why.
Those words make me feel like I've been beaten all over.

"...Hold on. What do you mean by a superhero being just a cleaner?"

"...You should have realized it already too.
Look, your methods will not allow you to reverse a sad event or a miserable death.
Those are the limits.
A superhero is only someone that tidies up events that have already taken place. You will definitely not be able to save the people you want to save the most."


That's not... true.
The hand reaching out to save someone must be able to save that person

"An ideal is only an ideal after all. As long as you embrace that ideal, the friction with reality will continue to increase. The path that you are about to take is of that sort.
So you will someday face reality and will have to pay the price for your compromises. That choice of yours might end up taking the lives of many people."

"Wha"
"Be at least prepared. When you realize how small you are, decide what you will make right and whom you will punish.
If you cannot do so, then throw away those dreams and magics of yours right now."
His back disappears into the night.

"Understand? No matter what anyone does, people that cannot be saved will always exist. All you can save with your ideal is the ideal itself. That is all humans can do.
But still"

"Hey wait! What are you trying to say...!?"
My question vanishes into the darkness.
Archer's presence is already gone, and my voice only reaches empty air.

"...What's with him? He disappears after mouthing off like that."
To summarize, he was telling me my way of thinking is too optimistic and that I'll soon have a painful experience.
How can anyone conclude that I'm wrong before I even try?

"I'm ready. If I'm wrong, I'll just pay with my life."
That must be the readiness as a magus.
I know that without having Archer tell me.

"Heh. I really can't get along with him."
...But.
But still, I have one concern.

No matter what anyone does, there will always be people that cannot be saved.
Humans can only do so little.
But still

"...But still. Can I follow that ideal without turning back even once?"
I mutter to myself.
I feel like that's what he wanted to ask me before he stopped himself.
...Why does she desire battle so much?
I might be able to understand Saber's mindset if I can find out why she seeks the Holy Grail, the reward of the Holy Grail War.
But, is that really something I can ask her?

"...Saber. Can I ask you a question?"
"Yes. What is it, Shirou?"

"Um, it's something I forgot to ask.
You're lending me your power because you also want the Holy Grail, right?
Sowhat do you want from the Holy Grail?"

"The reason I seek the Holy Grail? Can it not be because I desire it? The Holy Grail is an almighty vessel. There is no wish that cannot be granted if one possesses it. One needs no reason to seek such a thing."

"No. That's not what I'm asking.
Saber, you're trying not to answer my question, right?"
"OhShirou, that's..."

"I don't want to know the reason you seek it. I want to know what the wish you want granted is.
...But if you don't want to say, that's fine. My wishes aren't things I can talk about either."

Saber closes her mouth awkwardly.

...Well, it's only natural.
Saber didn't form the contract to help me personally.
Since the only ones who can obtain the Holy Grail are the Masters, she is only helping me to take share in the reward.

That is why she must be hesitating to tell her wish, and most of allI myself don't want to hear Saber describe a selfish wish.
...So I shouldn't have asked.
After all, it's rude for a person without a clear wish to ask other people's wishes.

"Shirou. Is that a command as a Master?"
Suddenly.
Saber asks the question with a serious expression.

"Eh... no, it's not. I didn't intend that.
I was just curious about you. Sorry for asking you about it."

"...No. As a Servant, I certainly must tell my Master my wish.
Shirou, I seek the Holy Grail to fulfill an obligation. I want the power of the Holy Grail to accomplish a duty I could not accomplish during my lifetime."
Directly.
With honest eyes, she says so.

"...Accomplish a duty...? During your lifetime... you mean, before you became a Servant...?"
"...Yes. But I do not know my true intentions myself.
Perhaps I only desire to redo things again."
Saber looks down quietly.
For a moment.
She looks like a repentant lost child.

"I-I see. Anyways, I'm relieved.
I was worried what I should do if you said something like Tohsaka, like your dream is to take over the world."

"...Fufu. Rin would be mad if she heard that. She is not someone who would say such a thing. She would use the Holy Grail purely for her own benefit, but it would not be something that would bring chaos to the world."

"Really? I think we should never let her have the Holy Grail for a completely different reason."
I nod to myself.
Saber is watching me with a gentle expression.

That's the end of the conversation.
It was a subject I should have kept away from.
The atmosphere is softened by talk of Tohsaka, so let's end this conversation right here.


But a small pain remains in my chest.
Even though I'm relieved that Saber's wish isn't a vulgar one, I think there's something wrong with that wish of hers.
...Before she became a Servant.
I wonder what Saber was like when she was alive as a human.

Saber is so beautiful, and I bet everyone liked her.
Though one might misunderstand from the name Saber, she might have been a normal girl who didn't even use a sword.

"...Yeah. I wonder what Saber was like before."
I get curious, and I accidentally speak my mind.

"Yes? Did you say something, Shirou?"
"Huh? No, I was just imagining what you were like before. I don't want to know your true name, but I was wondering what kind of a life you led."

"What kind of a person I was like...?
You are interested in strange matters, Shirou."

"Ignore it if it's a problem. It just popped in my head.
You're the Servant Saber, but I thought you might have been different before you became a Servant."

Yes.
I think that she might have led a calm life suitable for a lovely girl.

"I do not think that is possible.
People do not change their personality when they become a Servant, and I was a knight who was given a sword at birth. Any different self that you talk of never existed."

"Whoa, so you always had such a tense personality?
...That's terrible. I sympathize with the people who were around you."

"...What do you mean by that?
I am strict, but I do not coerce the people around me."

"Don't lie. I know from today's training that you're pitiless and have no mercy.
Look at this welt. You're happy to come pounding on me when I make a mistake, you devilish instructor."

"I-I was not happy about it!
I-I feel sorry for Shirou, but it would not be training if I was not strict!"


...How unusual.
It's really surprising for Saber to make that kind of an expression.

"W-What is with that expression? I think it is unfair to suddenly go silent."

"OhI wasn't expecting you to get angry like that, so I was surprised."

"Ehi-is that so? I only emphasized what I was thinking."
"That might be why. You don't talk much with your emotions. So that was new."

"I-Is that so? I believe I act based on my beliefs."
"I'm saying that it's your thinking, not your feeling.
No, not that. It's that you don't say what you really feel."

"That is only natural. What is demanded from me is not an opinion as an individual but an opinion from my position. That does not change even now.
I will protect you as the Servant Saber.
I should not say anything that does not relate to that purpose,[l]
and there is no need to even think about such things."

"That may be true, but that'll be boring for you, Saber.
You have a role, but I don't think you need to devote yourself to it. You have things you want to do too."

"As I said, protecting you is what I must do. In addition to being inexperienced as a Master, you do not listen to me and try to fight. That is why I am training you right now!"

"No, that's not it, but... well, I guess it's fine if you say so."
It seems Saber is softer and cheerful right now, so I don't want to ruin this calm mood by continuing this conversation.
...Um, it's not that I'm giving up my training, but...
It just might be that I'll be more into the fight with Saber if I have some special move that lets me do something just because I know it.

"Saber, I want to ask you something."
"What is it, Shirou...? I get the feeling that you are looking at me with a lot of expectation."

"Really? Well, if you put it like that, it is a request and I do have expectations. To be frank, I want you to teach me something."

"...Okay. Um, I do not quite understand what you are trying to say, but I will instruct you in anything that I am able to."

Saber must think it's a serious conversation as she adjusts herself and sits Japanese-style in front of me.

"So, what is it that you would like to know? Is it about the Servants?"
Saber looks at me seriously.

"Hm."
I feel like I already know what'll happen, but let's not expect anything and just ask her.

"Um. I'm not joking around or anything, so I want you to listen to me without getting mad."

"Yes, that is why I am listening seriously. Please ask me without reserve."

"Then, I'll accept that and ask you.
Um, well. If there is one, can you teach me an easy special move that'll let me beat a Servant? Ideally something that'll even let me beat you."


Saber stops breathing.


Saber does not move even an eyebrow.

"I-I guess there isn't anything that convenient, huh...!?
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry...! It was just a joke, so don't take it seriously and just pretend you didn't hear it! That'll really help me... out...."

Uh.
Saber-san is making an evil smile.

"S-Saber...? It may just be me, but you have a really unsuitable evil smile on your face."

"It is not just you. Right now, my mind is as wicked as Rin's is."

"...!!!!"
I feel a chill, I feel a chill...!

"Uh, wa, uh."
"Why are you panicking, Shirou? I have not answered your question yet. If I did not mishear you, I believe you desire a special move that will beat a Servant in one blow?"

I retreat, but Saber advances and doesn't let me escape.

"Ahum, well... Saber, you're mad, right?"
"Yes, very."

I'm dead.
If this were a real battle, she would have certainly killed me by now.

"Calm down, let's calm down Saber.
I've contemplated my actions. I think I know why you're mad too."
"I see. Then please sit there in a Japanese style. I cannot calm down unless I explain things to you."

Saber stands up.
I quickly straighten my back and prepare myself.


Saber takes a deep breath.
Then.

"Are you kidding me...!? What are you thinking of, asking for a cheat like a special move to beat an opponent in one blow!?!!!"

"Ahuh."
My ear canals are panicking.
I never thought I'd collapse just from an angry voice.
That was beyond human abilities.
Does she have a voice as powerful as a beast or a lion?

"S-Sorry... so I'm saying I'm contemplating my actions.
You're stronger than me, Saber. So I thought you might know a move that even an unskilled guy could use."

"There is nothing convenient like that!
A surprise move is something you use against someone of equal level, and a beginner like you should work thoroughly on your foundations!"

"First of all, I already told you not to think about defeating your opponent! Please think first about your protection! If there is a special move for you, it would be enough judgment to stop yourself from getting into a situation that requires you to fight!"

"Uh... I understand. I understand, solower your voice a little."
I put my hands together to show I'm sorry.

"...Geez, I had some expectations of you, but you are so unstable. If you are like this, it is too dangerous for me to leave you alone."
Saber's scolding continues.

"...Sigh."
It was my fault for stepping on the lion's tail.
I'll stay quiet and take Saber's scolding until she's satisfied.
...Well.
Talking has cooled me down, so let's continue with the training.
I'm skipping school, so I should acquaint my body with fighting as much as time allows.

"Saber, let's start. I've rested enough."
"...Is that so? It looks as if you have cooled down, but your pain has not yet gone away, right?"

"I don't care. They're just bruises, so I'll bear a little pain. I can heal automatically now."
"But there is no point in training if it worsens. I believe we should wait a bit longer and see."

"Don't worry. I want to finish this before Tohsaka gets home. We can't have her see me like this, right?"

"...Sigh. I understand. It is certainly not good to have Rin, our eventual enemy, find out your powers.
I believe it is a bit excessive, but if that is the case, let us bring the pace up a little."

Saber picks up the shinai.
And then.
A strange sound echoes through the dojo.

"Saber...?"
Um, I think that was Saber's stomach.
"I believe I am hungry. I did not notice since I was so engrossed in training."

"Ohyeah. Now that you mention it, it's lunchtime already."
No wonder her stomach has started growling.
I'm not that hungry yet, but if Saber's hungry, let's have lunch.
It'll be good if my body heals in that time as well.

"All right. It's a good time, so let's have lunch. I'll go buy some groceries, so you can rest in the living room."
"Shirou, I shall escort you if you are going outside."

"It's fine, I'm only going to the shopping district nearby. There's no one who would attack me in the daytime, and we'd rather stand out if you were with me."
"...There is really no danger?"
"No. I'll come back right away, so please wait here."

I take my wallet and go outside.
It won't take even ten minutes on a bicycle to get to the shopping district from here.
By the way, the bicycle I just took from the garage is bicycle number two. Number one is still out in front of the Ryudou Temple.

I descend the hill.
I don't think I've been to the shopping district in the daytime on a weekday since I was running errands as a child.

Because it's daytime, there are lots of housewives at the intersection, on their way home from shopping.
They're coming from the shopping district that Sakura and I go to regularly.

I finish buying all the groceries.
Ingredients for lunch for two, and a light Japanese snack.
Dinner tonight is fine since Tohsaka's in charge of that, but I buy enough bread for four people for tomorrow's breakfast.
I don't know how to make strawberry jam, so I buy the cheapest... no that'll probably get me some criticism, so I buy a rather expensive one.

"...Damn, it's really expensive. Why do I have to pay a thousand yen for something so sweet?"
I complain as I put the groceries into the bicycle cart.
And then.
I feel something tugging at my clothes from behind.

"...?"
I turn around, wondering what it could be.
There.
Is a young girl with silver hair.

"What, you're!?"
I back off, knocking the bicycle over.

I stand ready at once while the girl just smiles at me.

"...?"
I don't feel any murderous intent nor even enmity from that girl.
In addition, the girl says,"I'm glad. You're alive, Onii-chan."
And she smiles happily.

"!"
...This girl is definitely Berserker's Master.
The master of the monster that slashed me in one blow that night.
Who would expect to meet someone like this in a shopping district near their house, especially in daytime?

"Don't tell me... you intend to fight me here?"
"...? You're saying strange things. We can't fight while the sun's up."
She frowns in displeasure.
That is definitely the behavior of a young girl, suitable for her age.


I don't know her intentions.
I don't know her intentions, but even I can tell that the girl in front of me is harmless.

"Y-You'reif I remember correctly, uh..."
"Ilyasviel von Einzbern. It's long, so you can call me Ilya. So what's Onii-chan's name?"

"Me...? I'm Emiya Shirou."
"Emiyashiro? That's hard to say."

"...It's the first time I've heard it pronounced like that too. No, if you have trouble remembering it, you can call me Shirou. That's my name."

"Shirou? Oh, so it's an easier name than I thought. I see, Shirou. ...Yeah, that sounds good. It's simple, but it sounds aloof."
Ilyasviel looks at me with suggestive eyes.

"...!"
My body unintentionally moves and lowers its waist down so it can move more freely.
...Because she is Berserker's Master.
If she felt like it, she probably could blow me away along with the flower shop next to me.

"Oh, you don't have to be so careful. I left Berserker at home today. Onii-chan left Saber behind too, so we're equal."
Ilyasviel looks up at my face happily.

"...Well, what do you mean equal?"
"Hey, let's talk. I have lots of things I want to talk to you about."

"Wha!?"
The girl clings to my arm as naturally as if she were holding her father's.

"H-Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on...! What are you doing all of a sudden!? Is this some new scheme!?"
"We're just gonna talk. Normal children talk friendly, right?"

"Well, that's true, but we're different! We're both Masters and we've already fought! We're more like enemies!"

"That's not right. I don't have any enemies. Other Masters are just harmful bugs, but I can let you go if you behave yourself."

She's saying terrible things so casually too!
"Geez, just get off of me! You're being absurd!"
I swing my hand and throw Ilyasviel off.

"Kya...!"
She topples.
As I tried to make her let go, the girl almost falls to the ground.

"Oh no, Ilya!"
...Why the hell did I do something like that right then?
When I notice, I instantly reached out for Ilyasvielgeez, this is too longIlya's waist, and caught her as she fell.

I silently lower Ilya to the ground.
"......"
Ilya is silent.
I don't know what to say either, so I stand still looking down at Ilya.

...This is awkward.
This is awkward, so the instant I try to leave to go home...

"What? Do you not like me, Onii-chan?"
That night.
She says this with the same glowing red eyes she had when Berserker was with her.

"!"
A chill runs down my spine.
Her gestures up to now were so child-like that my sense of danger had faded, but she's definitely Berserker's Master.

I'll die if I disobey her.
I can't show my face to Saber if I die in vain here, and most of all, I'll involve all the people here in the shopping district.
...Yes, I can bet on it.
This girl would mercilessly use her power as a Master no matter where she is.

"...All right. We'll talk. I'll keep calm, so is that okay, Ilya?"

"Yup! Then let's go to the park over there. I just went to look at it, but there wasn't anyone there."
Ilya starts to run with dancing steps.

"Hurry, hurry! I'll leave you behind if you don't hurry, Shirou!"
Ilya runs through the shopping district, spinning in circles.

"...She really went on ahead."
Beyond amazement, I'm a bit moved.
For this girl Ilya, any promise is an absolute truth.

That's why she ran off so happily.
She doesn't think I'll run away thinking it's a chance to do so when I'm alone.
I told her I'll talk to her, so she ran off trusting me to do so.

"...What's with her?"
She's really unbalanced.
...But, well...
I'm not yet grown-up enough to betray such a pure trust.

Ilya and I are alone in the small park a little way from the shopping district.
Maybe all the children are at school or maybe such a small park isn't popular anymore.
Anyways, we start to talk in the empty winter park, bathed in a strangely tense atmosphere.

"...Wait, so what are we going to talk about?
Do you want to know about Saber?"
"Huh? Why would we talk about Saber?"

"Because we're Masters. We'd want to gain information on enemy Servants, right?"
"I don't wanna talk about that. It's boring if we don't talk about something more fun."

"Well, you say boring, but... Then what's fun for you, Ilya?"
"I don't know.
I haven't talked to other people much, so I don't know what I should talk about."

"...Hey, you brought me here to talk in spite of that? Didn't you get taught not to act on something until you think it through? I bet you didn't. So be a thoughtful adult from now on."

"...Hm. It's fine. I'll let you do that sort of thing.
It's the man's responsibility to escort the lady, right?
So all I have to do is follow you."

She smiles and leans on my shoulder.
She's not just being over-familiar, but it's as natural as a small animal snuggling because it's cold.
...Wait.
Looking closely at her, she does actually look cold.

"Ilya. Are you cold?"
"Huh? Yeah, I'm cold. I don't like the cold."

She breathes out a white puff.
Even though she said she doesn't like it, she looks at her breath happily.

"I see. It's not always like this, but it's strangely cold today. It would be pretty bad if you don't like the cold... um, where are you from, Ilya? Your name sounds kind of noble."

"It's not 'kind of noble', I am a noble.
I was born in the old Einzbern castle.
It was always cold and snowing. So I'm fine with this cold."

"...? You were born in a cold country, right? Then shouldn't you be used to the cold?"

"I'm used to it, but I don't like it. I like warm more than cold. Don't you like warm too?"
"Yeah, of course. I like it warm rather than cold."

"Yeah! So I stay warm in my room when it's cold. But I like the snow. It's so white and my dad said it's just like my hair."


I clap my hands together.
She's right now that she's mentioned it.
I was trying to work out what I associated with Ilya. If there was such a thing as a snow fairy, wouldn't it look like her?

"Your father says clever things. Your hair is certainly like snow. It's white and it looks soft."

"Ehehe, right? This hair is something I can brag about. It comes from my mom, and it's the only girlish thing about me."

Ilya laughs happily.
Seeing such gestures really numbs me.
I couldn't have believed she was really Berserker's Master if I hadn't seen it.

"How about you, Shirou? Do you have something you got from your dad? Oh, don't say the Magic Crest.
I'm talking about what you got from him as your dad, not as a Master."

"Huh, me? ...Hmmm... I guess my house in the end.
Before that, I got my last name. And the thing I got first was..."
My life when I was about to die.
Because I was the only one saved by Kiritsugu in that fire ten years ago.

"...Let's see, I don't have any physical features like you that I got from my parents. But I think I got a lot of things as good as that."

Ilya is delighted as if it concerned her.
I bet no one could stay unhappy if they were smiled at like this.

"But from what you said, you didn't get the Magic Crest, right? That's strange. Then you're not a Master?"

"...? No, I'm an amateur magus with no Magic Crest, but I'm still a Master.
How about you, Ilya? Umyou're a Master, so you're a magus, right?"

"Huh? I'm not a magus, but just a Master.
I was never taught any normal magic."

"Huh...!? Then you didn't get a Magic Crest from your parents? ...Um, your family is a noble family that even has a castle, right?"
"That's right... but isn't a Magic Crest what you need to become a Master? That's why I'm a Master."

Ilya tilts her head in confusion.
"...?"
I too tilt my head in confusion.
It seems like Ilya's words are slightly off, and we're not having a real conversation.

"...Hey Ilya. I'll ask you something, but where are you living right now? It seems you came here just for the Holy Grail War, so are you living in a hotel or something?"

No, first of all, it'll be terrible if she doesn't have a guardian.
It's unheard of to let a child like this come to Japan by herself.

"Hotel...? Do you mean the villa?"
"Yeah, something like that. It's a place you can stay, but it's not your house."

"Then I have one! See, there's a forest over there, right? Deep in it is a Western-style mansion my grandfather's grandfather built. They say the Master of Einzbern lives there during the Holy Grail War."

Ilya is pointing to the west.
...Certainly, there's a deep undeveloped mountain forest in that direction....

"It takes about an hour to get there even with a car, right? Are you coming here from there alone?"

"Yeah, I snuck out today. Sella and Leysritt are my maids, but they're annoying.
I came to Japan, so I think I can go outside just while I'm here. I always got what I wanted, but I was always shut away in my room, so this is a reward."

"...? You mean you were locked up in your room?"
"Yeah. When it snowed, they didn't let me outside because it was bad for my body. So I was playing inside most of the time.
Oh, but I'm fine. It's not as cold here as the castle, so I'm fine by myself."

Ilya says so with a full smile.
She swings her legs and it seems she's having fun just doing so.

"......"
Without knowing why, I put my hand into the grocery bag.
I take out the dora-yaki I was supposed to eat with Saber and again, without knowing why, hand it to Ilya.

"Do you want this? It's cheap, though."
"Huh? What is that? Food?"
"That's right. I don't like sweets, but this is an exception. This is the snack my father and I always have with tea."

"...Um. ...So, I can have it?"
Ilya looks up at me timidly.

"Yeah. It's no good if I eat by myself, so let's eat together."
I hand her the dora-yaki.
Ilya hesitates, and then takes the Japanese snack that I'm sure she's never seen before.

"Ehe. Yeah, thanks!"
She eats it happily.
Her gestures are so enthusiastic that the expression 'stuffing her cheeks' fits perfectly.


I eat my dora-yaki as well and endure the shock that attacked the back of my head.
...Geez.
Why was I thinking it might be nice to have a smaller sister like this?

"...But, really..."
I think Ilya is too innocent.
This girl might really be a child who doesn't yet know the difference between good and evil.
I can barely imagine how a child born in a family of magi is raised.
But stillI can tell that the environment Ilya was raised in wasn't normal.

Tohsaka is like that, but she's a magus by nature from the core. She has accepted the Holy Grail War and the killings between Masters as "murder".

But maybe this girl became a Master without knowing what it means to kill someone.
I've only talked a bit with her, but I don't think Ilya is a girl that would want to kill others.
So

"Ilya. This is a serious subject, but..."
Then.
Ilya suddenly raises her head as if called by someone.

"...Ilya? What's wrong?"
"Yeah. I have to go home. Berserker woke up."

She jumps off the bench.
Ilya runs out of the park without saying goodbye and disappears in a blink of an eye.
"I'm going, Shirou. I'll bring you home something, so be good."
Fuji-Nee goes to work, waving goodbye.

"I'll get going too. I'll be home a bit later since I'm going by my house, but I'll be home before dinner. Don't do anything careless while I'm gone."
Tohsaka says goodbye with a look and leaves for school.

"Well."
The time is just past 7:30.
I was able to send them off without delay, so there's only one thing to do now.

"Well, let's continue from yesterday. Let's go to the dojo, Saber."
"Are we starting the training immediately? We just ate breakfast, so should we not rest for a while?"

"There's no need to worry. I've trained enough to be able to move right after eating, and we had toast this morning too. I don't live so unhealthily that bread sits heavy in my stomach."

"...Oh. If you say it is fine, I do not mind."
"Then there's no problem. Let's go. I'll show you the results of planning all last night on how to hit you at least once."

"...!"
I'm blown to the ground along with my defending shinai, not fully able to dodge Saber's counter-attack.

"Hakuh..."
The hand holding my shinai is numb.
It was a counterattack received after charging into her with all my might trying to overpower her.
Naturally, I'll drop my shinai and fall on my butt.

"Damn. I thought that would work."
"Your judgments are too optimistic.
Please understand that you cannot defeat a Servant even if you put your life at risk in an attack. It is good to have determination, but please consider your opponent first."

"...Hm. You say so, but I'll be beaten eventually if I'm on the defensive. I have to go on the offense if there's a chance."

"That is true, but you do not understand how to make use of such a chance. If you are to attack risking your life, you should wait for an appropriate chance."

"You don't even need to tell me. You looked away for a bit earlier, right? Something like that only happens maybe once a day, so I thought it was a chance."

"It was good that you were able to make that judgment in an instant, but that was an opening I made intentionally.
I averted my gaze to see if you would be agitated by it, but I would never have thought you would come straight for me."

"Ugh. You're mean. It's no good making fun of a beginner."

"I am not making fun of you. Even if it is a plot of mine, as long as it is an opening, I bear some risk as well.
But then, the risk I took averting my gaze and the risk you took coming at me with your life do not even need to be scaled."

"...Hm. So the point is to softly attack the small openings? A large swing will miss the opportunity... no, I bet you want to say that I should act according to the size of the opening, right?"

"Yes. So please try to estimate the size of the opening."

"But you are much clearer than yesterday on the line of death. Once you obtain the skill to sense danger, the decisions of whom to fight and what to do naturally become limited."

Saber comments happily.
If I'm not imagining things, she might be happy that her student has improved a bit.

"It is almost time to take a break. Should I go and get some water, Shirou?"
"Oh, that's fine. I brought a kettle, so I'll drink from that."

I pull my tired body over to the wall.
I wipe my sweat off with the towel I prepared and drink the water out of the kettle.

"Phew."
I exhale.
...For three hours since I saw Fuji-Nee and Tohsaka out, I've been fighting Saber.

As usual, Saber doesn't explain anything and I don't ask anything as we cross swords.
It's a match with pretty much no chance of my victory, but my body moves better the more I fight Saber.

I'm not hoping to improve my fighting techniques.
This is just letting my body, not my mind, get used to battle.
But it's still better than doing nothing, and since I don't have anything, I'll be of no use unless I train this one aspect.
When the time comes for me to face a Master, if I am thinking about how to fight, that'll surely prove fatal.

"...Saber's... not sweating, as I expected."
I feel down, but I won't be able to catch up to her in a day or two.
Saber is resting her body, sitting Japanese-style like yesterday.

"Hm."
It's a waste just sitting here absent-mindedly.
It's break time, so I'll talk to her.
All right, then
...Before she became a Servant.
I wonder what Saber was like when she was alive as a human.

Saber is so beautiful, and I bet everyone liked her.
Though one might misunderstand from the name Saber, she might have been a normal girl who didn't even use a sword.

"...Yeah. I wonder what Saber was like before."
I get curious, and I accidentally speak my mind.

"Yes? Did you say something, Shirou?"
"Huh? No, I was just imagining what you were like before. I don't want to know your true name, but I was wondering what kind of a life you led."

"What kind of a person I was like...?
You are interested in strange matters, Shirou."

"Ignore it if it's a problem. It just popped in my head.
You're the Servant Saber, but I thought you might have been different before you became a Servant."

Yes.
I think that she might have led a calm life suitable for a lovely girl.

"I do not think that is possible.
People do not change their personality when they become a Servant, and I was a knight who was given a sword at birth. Any different self that you talk of never existed."

"Whoa, so you always had such a tense personality?
...That's terrible. I sympathize with the people who were around you."

"...What do you mean by that?
I am strict, but I do not coerce the people around me."

"Don't lie. I know from today's training that you're pitiless and have no mercy.
Look at this welt. You're happy to come pounding on me when I make a mistake, you devilish instructor."

"I-I was not happy about it!
I-I feel sorry for Shirou, but it would not be training if I was not strict!"


...How unusual.
It's really surprising for Saber to make that kind of an expression.

"W-What is with that expression? I think it is unfair to suddenly go silent."

"OhI wasn't expecting you to get angry like that, so I was surprised."

"Ehi-is that so? I only emphasized what I was thinking."
"That might be why. You don't talk much with your emotions. So that was new."

"I-Is that so? I believe I act based on my beliefs."
"I'm saying that it's your thinking, not your feeling.
No, not that. It's that you don't say what you really feel."

"That is only natural. What is demanded from me is not an opinion as an individual but an opinion from my position. That does not change even now.
I will protect you as the Servant Saber.
I should not say anything that does not relate to that purpose,[l]
and there is no need to even think about such things."

"That may be true, but that'll be boring for you, Saber.
You have a role, but I don't think you need to devote yourself to it. You have things you want to do too."

"As I said, protecting you is what I must do. In addition to being inexperienced as a Master, you do not listen to me and try to fight. That is why I am training you right now!"

"No, that's not it, but... well, I guess it's fine if you say so."
It seems Saber is softer and cheerful right now, so I don't want to ruin this calm mood by continuing this conversation.
...Um, it's not that I'm giving up my training, but...
It just might be that I'll be more into the fight with Saber if I have some special move that lets me do something just because I know it.

"Saber, I want to ask you something."
"What is it, Shirou...? I get the feeling that you are looking at me with a lot of expectation."

"Really? Well, if you put it like that, it is a request and I do have expectations. To be frank, I want you to teach me something."

"...Okay. Um, I do not quite understand what you are trying to say, but I will instruct you in anything that I am able to."

Saber must think it's a serious conversation as she adjusts herself and sits Japanese-style in front of me.

"So, what is it that you would like to know? Is it about the Servants?"
Saber looks at me seriously.

"Hm."
I feel like I already know what'll happen, but let's not expect anything and just ask her.

"Um. I'm not joking around or anything, so I want you to listen to me without getting mad."

"Yes, that is why I am listening seriously. Please ask me without reserve."

"Then, I'll accept that and ask you.
Um, well. If there is one, can you teach me an easy special move that'll let me beat a Servant? Ideally something that'll even let me beat you."


Saber stops breathing.


Saber does not move even an eyebrow.

"I-I guess there isn't anything that convenient, huh...!?
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry...! It was just a joke, so don't take it seriously and just pretend you didn't hear it! That'll really help me... out...."

Uh.
Saber-san is making an evil smile.

"S-Saber...? It may just be me, but you have a really unsuitable evil smile on your face."

"It is not just you. Right now, my mind is as wicked as Rin's is."

"...!!!!"
I feel a chill, I feel a chill...!

"Uh, wa, uh."
"Why are you panicking, Shirou? I have not answered your question yet. If I did not mishear you, I believe you desire a special move that will beat a Servant in one blow?"

I retreat, but Saber advances and doesn't let me escape.

"Ahum, well... Saber, you're mad, right?"
"Yes, very."

I'm dead.
If this were a real battle, she would have certainly killed me by now.

"Calm down, let's calm down Saber.
I've contemplated my actions. I think I know why you're mad too."
"I see. Then please sit there in a Japanese style. I cannot calm down unless I explain things to you."

Saber stands up.
I quickly straighten my back and prepare myself.


Saber takes a deep breath.
Then.

"Are you kidding me...!? What are you thinking of, asking for a cheat like a special move to beat an opponent in one blow!?!!!"

"Ahuh."
My ear canals are panicking.
I never thought I'd collapse just from an angry voice.
That was beyond human abilities.
Does she have a voice as powerful as a beast or a lion?

"S-Sorry... so I'm saying I'm contemplating my actions.
You're stronger than me, Saber. So I thought you might know a move that even an unskilled guy could use."

"There is nothing convenient like that!
A surprise move is something you use against someone of equal level, and a beginner like you should work thoroughly on your foundations!"

"First of all, I already told you not to think about defeating your opponent! Please think first about your protection! If there is a special move for you, it would be enough judgment to stop yourself from getting into a situation that requires you to fight!"

"Uh... I understand. I understand, solower your voice a little."
I put my hands together to show I'm sorry.

"...Geez, I had some expectations of you, but you are so unstable. If you are like this, it is too dangerous for me to leave you alone."
Saber's scolding continues.

"...Sigh."
It was my fault for stepping on the lion's tail.
I'll stay quiet and take Saber's scolding until she's satisfied.
...Why does she desire battle so much?
I might be able to understand Saber's mindset if I can find out why she seeks the Holy Grail, the reward of the Holy Grail War.
But, is that really something I can ask her?

"...Saber. Can I ask you a question?"
"Yes. What is it, Shirou?"

"Um, it's something I forgot to ask.
You're lending me your power because you also want the Holy Grail, right?
Sowhat do you want from the Holy Grail?"

"The reason I seek the Holy Grail? Can it not be because I desire it? The Holy Grail is an almighty vessel. There is no wish that cannot be granted if one possesses it. One needs no reason to seek such a thing."

"No. That's not what I'm asking.
Saber, you're trying not to answer my question, right?"
"OhShirou, that's..."

"I don't want to know the reason you seek it. I want to know what the wish you want granted is.
...But if you don't want to say, that's fine. My wishes aren't things I can talk about either."

Saber closes her mouth awkwardly.

...Well, it's only natural.
Saber didn't form the contract to help me personally.
Since the only ones who can obtain the Holy Grail are the Masters, she is only helping me to take share in the reward.

That is why she must be hesitating to tell her wish, and most of allI myself don't want to hear Saber describe a selfish wish.
...So I shouldn't have asked.
After all, it's rude for a person without a clear wish to ask other people's wishes.

"Shirou. Is that a command as a Master?"
Suddenly.
Saber asks the question with a serious expression.

"Eh... no, it's not. I didn't intend that.
I was just curious about you. Sorry for asking you about it."

"...No. As a Servant, I certainly must tell my Master my wish.
Shirou, I seek the Holy Grail to fulfill an obligation. I want the power of the Holy Grail to accomplish a duty I could not accomplish during my lifetime."
Directly.
With honest eyes, she says so.

"...Accomplish a duty...? During your lifetime... you mean, before you became a Servant...?"
"...Yes. But I do not know my true intentions myself.
Perhaps I only desire to redo things again."
Saber looks down quietly.
For a moment.
She looks like a repentant lost child.

"I-I see. Anyways, I'm relieved.
I was worried what I should do if you said something like Tohsaka, like your dream is to take over the world."

"...Fufu. Rin would be mad if she heard that. She is not someone who would say such a thing. She would use the Holy Grail purely for her own benefit, but it would not be something that would bring chaos to the world."

"Really? I think we should never let her have the Holy Grail for a completely different reason."
I nod to myself.
Saber is watching me with a gentle expression.

That's the end of the conversation.
It was a subject I should have kept away from.
The atmosphere is softened by talk of Tohsaka, so let's end this conversation right here.


But a small pain remains in my chest.
Even though I'm relieved that Saber's wish isn't a vulgar one, I think there's something wrong with that wish of hers.
...Um, it's not that I'm giving up my training, but...
It just might be that I'll be more into the fight with Saber if I have some special move that lets me do something just because I know it.

"Saber, I want to ask you something."
"What is it, Shirou...? I get the feeling that you are looking at me with a lot of expectation."

"Really? Well, if you put it like that, it is a request and I do have expectations. To be frank, I want you to teach me something."

"...Okay. Um, I do not quite understand what you are trying to say, but I will instruct you in anything that I am able to."

Saber must think it's a serious conversation as she adjusts herself and sits Japanese-style in front of me.

"So, what is it that you would like to know? Is it about the Servants?"
Saber looks at me seriously.

"Hm."
I feel like I already know what'll happen, but let's not expect anything and just ask her.

"Um. I'm not joking around or anything, so I want you to listen to me without getting mad."

"Yes, that is why I am listening seriously. Please ask me without reserve."

"Then, I'll accept that and ask you.
Um, well. If there is one, can you teach me an easy special move that'll let me beat a Servant? Ideally something that'll even let me beat you."


Saber stops breathing.


Saber does not move even an eyebrow.

"I-I guess there isn't anything that convenient, huh...!?
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry...! It was just a joke, so don't take it seriously and just pretend you didn't hear it! That'll really help me... out...."

Uh.
Saber-san is making an evil smile.

"S-Saber...? It may just be me, but you have a really unsuitable evil smile on your face."

"It is not just you. Right now, my mind is as wicked as Rin's is."

"...!!!!"
I feel a chill, I feel a chill...!

"Uh, wa, uh."
"Why are you panicking, Shirou? I have not answered your question yet. If I did not mishear you, I believe you desire a special move that will beat a Servant in one blow?"

I retreat, but Saber advances and doesn't let me escape.

"Ahum, well... Saber, you're mad, right?"
"Yes, very."

I'm dead.
If this were a real battle, she would have certainly killed me by now.

"Calm down, let's calm down Saber.
I've contemplated my actions. I think I know why you're mad too."
"I see. Then please sit there in a Japanese style. I cannot calm down unless I explain things to you."

Saber stands up.
I quickly straighten my back and prepare myself.


Saber takes a deep breath.
Then.

"Are you kidding me...!? What are you thinking of, asking for a cheat like a special move to beat an opponent in one blow!?!!!"

"Ahuh."
My ear canals are panicking.
I never thought I'd collapse just from an angry voice.
That was beyond human abilities.
Does she have a voice as powerful as a beast or a lion?

"S-Sorry... so I'm saying I'm contemplating my actions.
You're stronger than me, Saber. So I thought you might know a move that even an unskilled guy could use."

"There is nothing convenient like that!
A surprise move is something you use against someone of equal level, and a beginner like you should work thoroughly on your foundations!"

"First of all, I already told you not to think about defeating your opponent! Please think first about your protection! If there is a special move for you, it would be enough judgment to stop yourself from getting into a situation that requires you to fight!"

"Uh... I understand. I understand, solower your voice a little."
I put my hands together to show I'm sorry.

"...Geez, I had some expectations of you, but you are so unstable. If you are like this, it is too dangerous for me to leave you alone."
Saber's scolding continues.

"...Sigh."
It was my fault for stepping on the lion's tail.
I'll stay quiet and take Saber's scolding until she's satisfied.
...Why does she desire battle so much?
I might be able to understand Saber's mindset if I can find out why she seeks the Holy Grail, the reward of the Holy Grail War.
But, is that really something I can ask her?

"...Saber. Can I ask you a question?"
"Yes. What is it, Shirou?"

"Um, it's something I forgot to ask.
You're lending me your power because you also want the Holy Grail, right?
Sowhat do you want from the Holy Grail?"

"The reason I seek the Holy Grail? Can it not be because I desire it? The Holy Grail is an almighty vessel. There is no wish that cannot be granted if one possesses it. One needs no reason to seek such a thing."

"No. That's not what I'm asking.
Saber, you're trying not to answer my question, right?"
"OhShirou, that's..."

"I don't want to know the reason you seek it. I want to know what the wish you want granted is.
...But if you don't want to say, that's fine. My wishes aren't things I can talk about either."

Saber closes her mouth awkwardly.

...Well, it's only natural.
Saber didn't form the contract to help me personally.
Since the only ones who can obtain the Holy Grail are the Masters, she is only helping me to take share in the reward.

That is why she must be hesitating to tell her wish, and most of allI myself don't want to hear Saber describe a selfish wish.

That's the end of the conversation.

The atmosphere is softened by talk of Tohsaka, so let's end this conversation right here.


But a small pain remains in my chest.
Even though I'm relieved that Saber's wish isn't a vulgar one, I think there's something wrong with that wish of hers.
...Before she became a Servant.
I wonder what Saber was like when she was alive as a human.

Saber is so beautiful, and I bet everyone liked her.
Though one might misunderstand from the name Saber, she might have been a normal girl who didn't even use a sword.

"...Yeah. I wonder what Saber was like before."
I get curious, so I accidentally speak out my mind.

"Yes? Did you say something, Shirou?"
"Huh? No, I was just imagining what you were like before. I don't want to know your true name, but I was wondering what kind of a life you led."

"What kind of a person I was like...?
You are interested in strange matters, Shirou."

"Ignore it if it's a problem. It just popped in my head.
You're the Servant Saber, but I thought you might have been different before you became a Servant."

Yes.
I think that she might have led a calm life suitable for a lovely girl.

"I do not think that is possible.
People do not change their personality when they become a Servant, and I was a knight who was given a sword at birth. Any different self that you talk of never existed."

"Whoa, so you always had such a tense personality?
...That's terrible. I sympathize with the people who were around you."

"...What do you mean by that?
I am strict, but I do not coerce the people around me."

"Don't lie. I know from today's training that you're pitiless and have no mercy.
Look at this welt. You're happy to come pounding on me when I make a mistake, you devilish instructor."

"I-I was not happy about it!
I-I feel sorry for Shirou, but it would not be training if I was not strict!"


...How unusual.
It's really surprising for Saber to make that kind of an expression.

"W-What is with that expression? I think it is unfair to suddenly go silent."

"OhI wasn't expecting you to get angry like that, so I was surprised."

"Ehi-is that so? I only emphasized what I was thinking."
"That might be why. You don't talk much with your emotions. So that was new."

"I-Is that so? I believe I act based on my beliefs."
"I'm saying that it's your thinking, not your feeling.
No, not that. It's that you don't say what you really feel."

"That is only natural. What is demanded from me is not an opinion as an individual but an opinion from my position. That does not change even now.
I will protect you as the Servant Saber.
I should not say anything that does not relate to that purpose,[l]
and there is no need to even think about such things."

"That may be true, but that'll be boring for you, Saber.
You have a role, but I don't think you need to devote yourself to it. You have things you want to do too."

"As I said, protecting you is what I must do. In addition to being inexperienced as a Master, you do not listen to me and try to fight. That is why I am training you right now!"

"No, that's not it, but... well, I guess it's fine if you say so."
It seems Saber is softer and cheerful right now, so I don't want to ruin this calm mood by continuing this conversation.
Before I realize it, it's noon.
"It is lunchtime, Shirou."
"Yeah, it's lunchtime."
We confirm this to each other as both our stomachs growl.

"Let's eat. Is there something you'd like, Saber?"
"Nothing in particular. I am mostly satisfied with the food you prepare."

Saber's expression is a bit strange.
...Well, it helps that she's not nagging like Tohsaka.

"Then I'll go to get some groceries. I'll come home around the same time as yesterday, so go on ahead to the living room."
"Yes. I'll be waiting, Shirou."

I decide to try making shrimp dumpling, which I have wanted to try making for a while.
It's a dish that's a bit larger than takoyaki, and it's really hot and tasty.

"...I bought some mustard, and also the snacks for the three o'clock tea...."
I put the groceries into the bicycle cart.
Oh yeah.
I met Ilya here yesterday.

"She's not here."
No, it would be a problem if she was here everyday, but not having her here is rather disappointing.
...I haven't told Saber or Tohsaka that I met Ilya yesterday.
Because Ilya didn't seem like an enemy, I was hesitant to tell them about her.

"...No way. Just because she was here yesterday doesn't mean she'll be here today."
So, I get on the bike and

1) Go straight home.
2) Go and visit the park.
I'll go straight home.
Saber is looking forward to lunch, and I'm in no position to stop by anywhere.

So I make the shrimp dumplings.
It's not really a dish to eat with rice, but it's best with alcohol. Originally, it was something I learned to cook at the bar restaurant I work at.

"Shirou. This is really hot."
Saber eats the round deep-fried food, bigger than a golf ball but smaller than a tennis ball.

"Are you sensitive to hot food, Saber? Or do you not like such roughly made food?"

"No, I have no problem with either. The hotness is interesting, and the taste is coarse, but I can also feel a great deal of care."

"I see. I'm glad you like it."
"Yes. It is too bad we cannot let Rin or Taiga have some."

Saber continues to eat silently.
Perhaps because she worked out in the morning, it seems she's eating more than usual.


...Um, I don't know if this is appropriate for a guy, but I'm happy if someone eats my food. Even more so if they think it's good.
I'm unskilled as a Master, so if Saber gets happy from just this, I'll put more effort into making meals... huh?

...Saber is looking at the empty plate with an intense expression.

"Saber...? I'll make some more if that wasn't enough."
"Eh...? N-No, I've enjoyed enough. I-I-It is not that I did not have enough."

"All right. Then let's have some tea. I'll go brew some right away, so wait here."
I take the empty plates into the kitchen.
I put the dishes into the sink and put the kettle over the fire to make some tea.

"Oh yeah. Saber, how about having a different kind of tea..."
I pop my face out of the kitchen.
...And.

"...But this is a problem. Shirou's food is good.
If I stop eating from now on, my will to fight will certainly decrease.
...I am still too indulgent. I have experienced it several times, but starvation tactics are so dreadful."

"Um, well."
...I take it back. I'll stop putting so much effort into cooking.
If I keep putting more effort into cooking like this, she might end up making me into her personal cook.
Yup.
People shouldn't overdo things.
Let's take the long way home.
It's about a five minute detour.
This is just like a whim, so I shouldn't have to worry about excuses

I go by the park and put my brakes on.

I stop the bicycle.
I enter the park with the groceries still in the bicycle cart.

"Why?"
Why is it like this?
It was just a whim.
Inside the park I passed, thinking that it would be nice if I could meet her again...
...Is the figure of a silver-haired girl.

Ilya is standing there absent-mindedly, not doing anything.
It doesn't seem like she notices me.
I can leave right now if I want to.
Butif I was going to do such a thing, I wouldn't have come by this park in the first place.

"Ilya."
I call out to her.

"Who's there!?"
"Um, it's just Shirou."
"Eh... really, Shirou...?"
She must have been really surprised, as Ilya is looking at me with wide open eyes.

"Why are you so surprised?
This place is near the shopping district, so I pass by it from time to time. How about you, why are you here? You were here yesterday too, so do you have a lot of free time?"

"Actually, yeah. I came to play since there's not much to do, but Sella said I shouldn't see you. She said it's no fun playing with you because I'm going to end up killing you soon anyway."

"Ahwell, that's..."
...Whoa.
I don't know how to answer that. She just said something that really troubles me....

"But I think that's wrong because it's fun being with you. So I thought I might see you here, and I was waiting for ages.
Yeah. I'm glad you came."

"...Hold on. You weren't really waiting for me, were you?"
"I was.
I've been thinking for ages it would be nice if you came."

"...Idiot. You don't like the cold, right? If you want to see me, come to my placeno, that's bad. If you met Saber, it'd just turn into a fight.
But still, there are plenty of other ways. You would've been able to find me if you were waiting in the shopping district like yesterday."

"No, I can't do that. I can't come and see you myself. Yesterday was a one-time only cheat.
So I just waited where you might come today, and it ended up working."

Saying so happily, Ilya takes a few steps as if dancing.
Her swaying silver hair makes her look like a real winter fairy.

"...I understand, but why did you come to see me? Well, if a conversation like yesterday is enough, I'll keep you company."

"No, it's nothing today. I just wanted to see you, and we're enemies anyways. I'll come and kill you when the Holy Grail War's almost over, so let's talk then."

She says it so innocently.
...That unsuitability is unbearable.
It's not because I'm going to be killed. I just don't think being a Master suits her.

"...Ilya. Is that really something you want to do?
Did you really enter this war by your own choice?"

"Yeah, that's right. It was what my grandfather told me to do.
I'm the most suited to be a Master out of all the Einzberns, and I'm the owner of the big Holy Grail."

"...Doesn't that mean you're just doing what your grandfather told you to do? You didn't become a Master by your own will, did you?"

"Hmmm... Was that it...? I can't remember too well, but I've been a Master since I was born. So they said it's only natural for me to fight."
"That's wrong. If you're only fighting because people tell you to, stop.
First of all, such killing doesn't suit you, Ilya."

Ilya stops moving.
Her eyes look directly into mine.

"...Hmm. It doesn't look like you're pleading for your life.
It looks like Onii-chan's really worried about me."

"...That's right. Putting others aside, I don't like someone like you fighting. If it's possible, I want you to quit being a Master and stay calm."

"Hehe. Let's see, if you'll be my Servant, I'll quit. Then I won't have to kill you."

"Whaw-w-what are you saying!? Do you know what it means to tell me to be a Servant...!?"
...No, first of all, I can't substitute for Berserker!

"I'm saying you should stop fighting. I'm telling you to get rid of your Servant, so why do I have to become your familiar?"

"Not a familiar, I said a Servant.
Servants are people that are always with you, right? So all you have to do is stay by my side."

"Ehhuh?"
...Hold on.
Could it be, Ilya

"Let me ask you something. What is a Servant, Ilya?"
"It's mine, right? My grandfather said it's someone that's always by my side and protects me."


...As I thought.
Servants must be just that for Ilya.
None of the Command Spell or Master stuff concerns her.
For her, a being that protects her is a Servant.

"...I see. But I still can't do that. I can't accept that condition, so give me something else."
"W-What?
Are you saying I'm not good enough for you...?"

"No, nothing like that but... well, how can I put this"
I'm worried about her, but I can't be someone who'll be by her side all the time

"Ilya, I already have Saber.
And as a Master, I also have to stop the other Masters. Um, I'm sorry, but I can't be your Servant."

"...! What!? I made a compromise because it was you, but if you say that, I don't even know you...!"
"Hey... hold on, Ilya, I'm not done"

"Stupid Shirou! It's terrible of you to embarrass a girl!"
"Oh... she's gone..."
She doesn't listen to me and just runs out of the park.

Though I run after her, I can't find her anywhere.
"Geez. This is just like yesterday."
I sigh and return to my bike.

...But, well, if she's like that, I'm sure she won't suddenly attack me like she did the first night we met.
That means there's at least one more chance to convince her.
Today's training ends when the sun sets.
I'm near my limit, and I have to get Tohsaka to teach me magic tonight.
I couldn't accomplish my goal of landing a blow on Saber, but I should save some of my energy for tonight.

So, it's my turn to cook dinner tonight.
Saber went to wash off her sweat after me, so she won't be back for a while.

"I'm home. Oh, you're preparing dinner properly, Shirou.
"Good for you, well done."

Fuji-Nee enters the living room energetically, heads straight for the cushion, and sits down.
Unlike Saber, who has to sleep through half of the day, she's like this twenty-four hours a day.
I bet she's like this even when she's asleep.

"Hey, Shirouuu. Can I eat these apples?" she asks me while looking at the apples on the table.

"Go ahead. As you can see, we have plenty. It's necessary for each person to eat three a day."
"Really? Then should we make something like apple pie. Well, I mean you, though."

Fuji-Nee bites into the apple while saying something loosely.
...The ones on the table are the ones I've washed already, but I guess she's not the type to care about such things.

"...Geez, they're a get-well gift too..."
Even though it was just a misunderstanding, shouldn't she be more thoughtful about a gift given by a friend who cares for me?
I have to tell her clearly.

1) Fuji-Nee, where`s my gift?
2) ...She might really get me to make a pie. I`ll stay away for a while.
3) Apples won`t do. Eat some Mandarins, Fuji-Nee.
...I stop preparing dinner and take off my apron.
When I wash my hands and go into the living room, Fuji-Nee doesn't have the apple in her hand anymore.

"Fuji-Nee, did you eat that apple?"
"Yeah, I did. It was sweet and sour and good."
"I see. Then it's your turn. Give me a gift for what you've eaten."

"...? Gift... you mean oranges?"
"...I won't ask how you came to that conclusion.
I'm just telling you to give me the gift you have for me. Don't tell me you forgot what you said before leaving this morning."

"Don't be rude, I do remember. See, I have it right here."
Fuji-Nee puts a strange paper bag on the table and empties it out.


This is unexpected.
I don't think it's like Fuji-Nee to remember about her promises.
"...But, what is that? For me, um..."
No matter how I look at it, it just looks like garbageI mean, a mountain of stuffed animals.

"For Shirou, I have this Aztec stone mask. Your room's empty, right? It should increase the warmth a bit if you have this there."
She hands me a heartful and suspicious mask fashioned like a sun.
It's a thing about size of a baseball, with soft stuffing in it.

"...Fuji-Nee. Was this a hundred yen each game?"
"Yeah, it was a lot of work getting that. I never gave up and in the end, I had the guy working there take it out for me."
She's laughing in embarrassment, but I'm scared to think how bloody the fight must have been.

"Umm... I also have a Chinese dragon, bat, crab, cow, snake, charging soldier..."
Fuji-Nee happily separates the mountain of stuffed animals.

A few stuffed animals roll off the table and the living room becomes a mess in an instant.
...It's getting messy, but since Fuji-Nee seems to be having fun, I don't want to stop her.

"Well, I'll take it. You should clean up once you're done sorting them."
"Yup, I know."

I go back to the kitchen with the stuffed animal in my hand.
Then.
She must have just passed by, as I see Saber at the entrance to the living room in a really bad mood.

"......"
Saber is glaring into the living room, saying nothing.

"Saber...? Are you done with the bath already?"
"Yes, it was very nice."
She answers in her usual manner, but she enters the living room unsteadily like she's sleepwalking.

Saber walks like that to the table and stops right in front of a discarded stuffed animal.
"Taiga. Is this puppet modeled after a lion?"
"Eh? Yeah, it looks like it. That's a baby lion."

"......"
Saber is silently staring at the stuffed animal at her feet.

"Are these puppets yours, Taiga?
Um, like those puppets over there..."
"Yeah, do you want some? I can give you some if you want," Fuji-Nee asks Saber lightheartedly.

"!"
Whoa, what is Fuji-Nee thinking...!?
She should be able to tell that Saber's in a bad mood, so why is she asking her such a ridiculous thing!?
First of all, does she really think Saber would want such a thing?

"Do you want it? It's no good if I keep it, so I can give it to Saber-chan."
Fuji-Nee holds up the stuffed lion, not noticing Saber's dislike.

Saber takes it and...
"Please."
...Steps forward seriously and accepts it.

"...Huh?"
My mind freezes.
What kind of an illusion is this?
Saber is holding that chunk of uselessness like it's really important.

"I appreciate it very much. Thank you, Taiga."
"Don't worry about it. That's not a tiger."
...Hold on. There was something wrong with that comment, Fuji-Nee.

"But I'm a bit surprised. You like this kind of thing, Saber-chan?"
"Yes. I have longed for something small and cute.
I have not had many chances to hold such a thing."

Saying that, Saber looks down at the stuffed lion in her arms.
That face, looks like
"?"
...What was that?
I felt like I saw... something weird.

"Hm? Could it be that Saber-chan likes lions? A rival?"
Saber nods with the same smile she had looking at the stuffed lion.

"It does not mean I like them, but I have a bond with them.
I once took care of a lion cub and I was happy that the child was attached to me.
So since that time, I have had feelings for them.
Originally, I was more linked to dragons, but..."

"I see, a lion cub... oh, aren't lion cubs like cats or something? Don't they bite and scratch and all?"

"Yes, he was energetic enough to do such things.
I only took care of him for about a month, but I wish I could have been allowed to be with him until the end."

"I see, I see. But that's hard. Lions get really large. A normal house can't keep them, so you have to let them go."
Fuji-Nee nods to herself.

Saber is still staring at the stuffed lion.

I don't know what sort of magic it had on it, but...
...A scene I shouldn't know about pops into my head.


...I know myself that it's something like dizziness.
But still, I cannot shake it off.

...Her own memories.
An event that really did happen in the past.
Saber, rubbing her cheek against the lion, looks like a girl her age should.
I don't know if this is just a momentary thing.
All I know is that I find this dizziness special.


The strange illusion disappears quickly.
...But my heart rustles.
I feel like the illusion I caught a glimpse of is engraved in my head like a scar that never goes away.
"Fuji-Nee. It's fine that you eat apples, but eat your requirements. Those oranges you bought... there's still a boxful of them."

"Aw, I remember that now.... Uhh, I'm tired of eating oranges."
Fuji-Nee says this, digging her fangs... I mean, her teeth into the apples.

"What do you mean, you're tired of eating them? Remember I was against it? Even though there's only me, Sakura, and you, you bought nearly 10 mochi and 3 boxes of oranges.
You buy too much just because it's New Years. There's still a box left even though it's February. If you let it rot, I'll make you pay for all of it.

"Ugh. ...I'm just asking, but, how long does it take for oranges to rot?"
"Oh, about 2 weeks to a month in normal temperatures. They're almost out."
Well, I kept them in the ice room, so they should be good for a bit longer.

"Gah, so now's the time to eat and time to rot?"
"...Fuji-Nee. Never live by yourself. Food poisoning is scary nowadays. Check the expiration date on your food and watch out for fish in the summer."

"It's fine, I'll just come to your place when that happens.
You can just give me the leftovers."
"...I won't give you leftovers, you idiot.
You eat a lot. If you're going to come and eat, I'll prepare some for you too."
I avert my gaze and start preparing dinner again.

"Hm. Then I'll make lots of money and give you money for food.
You're good-for-nothing like Kiritsugu-san, so I expect you'll be always in trouble for money."

"Keep talking. ...Anyways, why did you get so many oranges? You should know Sakura doesn't like those kinds of fruit, and I don't eat much either."
It's a good opportunity, so I ask her a question I've been wondering since the New Year.

"Hmm, I don't know. Oh, but Orange-peko sounds good, right?"

...Well.
I guess it was stupid of me to hope for a logical answer from Fuji-Nee.
Yeah.
She might really make me cook an apple pie.
Dinner is almost prepared, so let's escape for a while.

"Hm? Where are you going with your apron still on, Shirou?"
"Um, just to the entrance. Tohsaka isn't home yet, so I'm thinking of going to take a look."

"Wow, you're thoughtful, Shirou. Yeah, Tohsaka-san's a girl, so she'll probably be happy to be greeted by you."
I don't know what she's happy about, but she sees me off cheerfully.

"......"
...Dammit.
Now I really have to go outside.

"Well, I'll go around the neighborhood once."
I take off my apron and head to the entrance.
And then.
The door to the bathroom opens with a sound.

"Shirou? Are the preparations for dinner fine?"
"[r]
"
A brief silence.
It's obvious who this person is, but it's really hard for me to say her name.

"Shirou...? Why do you seem so astonished? I do not think so, but did something go wrong with the dinner preparations?"
"No, nothing like that, but..."
I manage to reply in a surprised voice.

"...?"
She tilts her head.
Her hair at her shoulders sways.
Her golden hair is wet and different from usual.
No, her hair isn't the only thing that's different.
The girl in front of me looks like her age, and appears cute and weak to anybody's eyes.

"I see. You were taking a bath, Saber."
"...? You were the one who insisted I do so...?"
"Oh yeah. ...Do you like baths?"
"Yes. I discovered that when I became a Servant. Previously, I could not take a bath because of the people surrounding me."

Saber says this with a girl-like face.
It must be because she does not have her hair braided.
There's no gallant masculine aspect to her at all.

"Please go ahead if you are washing yourself as well. It is cold tonight, so the hot water will feel good on your body."
Saber goes to the living room, saying goodbye.


...I'm at a loss for words.
I knew from the start that Saber was a girl.
But stillthe sword suited her, and I admit that as well.

Even so, this is cheating.
...I saw Saber's naked body yesterday.
I could not consider it as reality because I was so surprised, but today is different.

"...She's a girl."
I hit the back of my head against the wall.
Not knowing what I want to do, I blankly stare at the ceiling.

"This isn't good. I think this is really bad."
I lean onto the wall and murmur.
The coldness of the hallway clears my mind and my usual self returns slowly.

And, after that.
I still could not figure out at all what was so bad about it.
Preparation for dinner ends, and the time is past seven.
Fuji-Nee and Saber are in the living room, and only Tohsaka is absent.

"...I wonder if something happened to her outside."
I don't think Tohsaka is the type to make that kind of mistake, but I think she does make big mistakes sometimes.
"I guess I'll go take a look."
I should be fine by myself if I'm just going to go search around the house.

I exit into the hallway.
The instant I try to leave, the door opens and Tohsaka in her coat arrives home.

"Tohsaka."
"I'm home. What, are you greeting me in an apron? You look pretty good in it."

Tohsaka makes that humorous comment without even twitching her brow.
...She's scary.
People who can put on a serious face while joking are the scariest.

"Tohsaka, what were you"
As I try to ask her what happened, I notice the blood on her hand.
...A small stain of blood and a swollen index finger.
Could that be...?

"Tohsaka. I'm going to guess about something bad."
"What? I won't listen if it's anything stupid."
"It's not. Have you punched someone?"

"Correct. I gave that annoying Shinji some knuckles."
Tohsaka snorts and passes by me.

"......"
I see, some knuckles for Shinji.
Now I understand the blood on her hand and the swelling on her fingerhang on!!!

"Hold on, hold on, hold on! What do you mean, you punched Shinji!?"
"You're being loud. He was being annoying, so I beat him up."

"Beat him up... you mean, with bare knuckles?"
"Bare as it can be. A grizzly bear, too."
Tohsaka snorts again.

"......"
"......"
A brief silence.
I don't know what to say, so I just shut my mouth and cause an awkward silence.

"...Let's get back to the main subject.
You said you punched Shinji, but why?"

"It's only natural I punched him. He was talking about things like me joining him, and you being useless so I should give up on you.
He said stupid things after calling for me, so I punched him to make him shut up."

"......"
No, isn't that a little too short-tempered, Tohsaka?
...Or could it be?
Did Shinji say something stupid enough to even piss off the ever-calm Tohsaka?

"...Why are you looking at me like that? I'll say this, but I'm the victim here."
"No, both sides are equally responsible, right?
...But still, why would Shinji say something like that to you? He said he wanted me to cooperate with him."

"Who knows? Maybe he thinks of you as a rival or something. He was acting weird ever since I told him I was living with you."

"What!? Tohsaka, you told him about us!?"

"Yeah, I did. I think it was yesterday morning. Shinji called me and said proudly that he became a Master like me now. He pissed me off, so I told him that you were the same too.
I thought he learned his lesson, but he was waiting outside my house for me a while ago."

"So, I told him I'm living at your house now and I didn't have any intention of cooperating with a half-assed Master like him... what, was that bad?"


That's generally bad.
Shinji is very conscious of Tohsaka under normal circumstances, so this is like pouring oil onto a fire.

...Well, but still... I see, I get it now.
I understand why Shinji only saw Tohsaka as the enemy, and why he kept asking her to cooperate with him.
In a word, he

"But it's strange, isn't it? I wonder why he's so fussed up about me. Judging from his personality, I wouldn't expect him to want to cooperate with anyone."
No.
It's because Tohsaka Rin is important to Matou Shinji.

"It's not strange at all. I think you're a special person for Shinji.
His was a family of magi originally, right?
ThenI think he admired you since you were of the lineage of a magus family like him, and you still retain the blood of it."

That's why he's persistent about Tohsaka.
I think Tohsaka Rin has been a target of his affections from even before this Holy Grail War started.

"WHAT!? ...Well, I am a bit happy about being liked, but still"
It must have been a real surprise, as Tohsaka stands pondering.

"...Oh, I remember. Come to think of it, Shinji asked me out when I was a first year."
She makes a terrible "gah, I forgot about it" reaction.
...I'll sympathize with Shinji, just for now.

"Whoa, no wonder he never gets enough of talking to me. I understand now."
"...That's fine. So, how did you reply?"

"Oh, I think I rejected him.
I can't stand it if I'm not the first to make a move in a contest.
It's like I can't get in the mood unless I'm setting the mood, or like I don't feel like it if someone else starts a match."

Tohsaka ponders, as if she really doesn't remember.
I'm shocked.
She must really live following only her feelings.

"Tohsaka. You suck at rock, paper, scissors, right?"
"Huh!? Wait, how do you know that!?"
...As I thought.
Of course, if she likes to make the first move, she would be weak against a later move.

"Use the soy sauce for that, Saber. Don't put mayonnaise on it, even by mistake."
"I see. Well, I saw Taiga do so, so I thought I should as well."

"......"

"Fuji-Nee is just playing around. She's not much of a reference, so be careful from now on."

"...I see. I was referencing Sakura before, so you never warned me, but..."
"No, I'm not angry. I worked hard to make it, so I just want you to have it at its best. So, getting back to the original conversation..."

"......"

"Shirou, I'll take seconds. Give me lots of stuff in my miso soup."
"All right. How about you, Saber? I bet you're hungry since we worked harder today."

"Not really. But I will take another just in case."
"Yeah, go ahead. If you also started recklessly raiding the fridge at night because you were too hungry to sleep, I'd die of shock."

"......"

"Hey, that's terrible. I told you that wasn't me. It was some burglar that raided the fridge."

"Then could you tell that robber that she shouldn't just eat meat, but that she should eat vegetables as well? And tell her not to finish off all the desserts in the fridge as if that's what she was after. Geez, she's like a hungry animal or something."
"What!? Don't call me a tiger!"
"Whoa, I didn't call you that! Ow, hot! Don't throw the hot white radish, you idiot!"

"......"

"Shirou. It seems the pot in the kitchen is boiling."
"Huh? Oh, hold on Fuji-Nee, I need to turn the fire off."
"All right. Bring me some chicken and boiled egg in soy sauce quickly."
"Roger. Then keep Fuji-nee company, Saber."
"Yes. Please do not rush your cooking, Shirou."

"......"

I get up.
...Oh yeah.
Why has Tohsaka been quiet all this time?

"Tohsaka? Does dinner taste bad?"
"No. It's nothing, so don't talk to me."
She looks away sullenly.
...Hmm. She's not the kind to drag that thing about Shinji out this long, so maybe something has irritated her.

Dinner ends as usual and Fuji-Nee goes home satisfied.
Saber and Tohsaka are in the living room.
It was an awkward mood before, but since I've trained with Saber for the past two days, it doesn't feel awkward anymore.

"Saber, you can go to bed. I'll do the rest."
"No, I will stay awake until you go to sleep. I would also like to learn from Rin how skilled you are in magic."

"I see. Then let's go to Tohsaka's room a bit earlier than usual. You don't mind, Tohsaka?"

"No, I don't mind. But you are getting along much better with Saber."
...?
For some reason, Tohsaka says this with the same displeasure she had when we were eating dinner.

"I'll be waiting in my room, so come when you're done cleaning up.
...And I'll also be skipping school from tomorrow on. So come to my place in the afternoon."
Tohsaka leaves the living room, still in a bad mood.

"Shirou, did you do something to Rin? She seems angry."
"Did it seem that way to you too?
...I don't know. I didn't do anything to anger her."

We both look at each other and tilt our heads.
We have no idea why Tohsaka's angry.
"Then to start with, go ahead and 'strengthen' this lamp.
You just have to strengthen the glass on the outside."
She hands me an antique lamp.


I sit down.
I take a deep breath, holding the lamp in both hands.
Tohsaka speaks so easily, but I'm rigid all over with tension.

Even though I do it every night, the reality is that the success rate is below 0.1 percent.
Tohsaka says she'll study the extent of my strengthening to determine the level I'm at, but she won't be able to do even that if I fail at the strengthening.


That's no good. I shake off my idle thoughts.
I concentrate my mind on the lamp.

The blueprint of the lamp emerges.
I could draw a diagram of the glass's material, shape, and even the flow of strength that would correspond to blood vessels in humans.
So all I have to do now is to put my magical energy into those blood vessels.

...I just have to do as I always do.
The feeling of driving a burning metal rod into my backbone.
All I have to do is stick that incompatible burning nerve into my body and familiarize myself with it.
Once that succeeds, all I have to do is pour in the correct amount of magical energy for the glass and

"Oh"
I broke it.
I must not have been able to control it, as I put more than the proper quantity of magical energy into it, and as a result, the glass breaks easily.

"......"
I look up at Tohsaka timidly.
"...As I thought. I thought this might be the case, but it really was."
Tohsaka's shoulders slump.

"Hm? What do you mean you thought so?"
"Isn't it obvious? I'm just dumbfounded by your lack of talent...! First of all, you don't have the basics down. Geez, I'm impressed you can produce magical energy with such a ridiculous method!"

"...Tohsaka. Are you angry?"

"Of course! I'm amazed you've kept training with such basic problems, and I even want to kill your teacher for not correcting you.
Why are you taking such a long route...!?".

"...Hm. I don't get what you're saying, but don't insult my father. It's my fault that I don't have any talent, so my father has nothing to do with it."

"Of course he has something to do with this. If you take an apprentice, it's the role of the teacher to correct the student.
...Well, you're right that it does no good to take it out on someone who's already gone, but still, your teacher got the first step wrong."

Still angry, Tohsaka takes out some kind of a can from her bag.
It looks like a can filled with candy drops, something foreign children treasure.
I've seen a lot of imitations in Japan as well.
That thing that has several varieties of candy, and the white one being the mint.

"Hold out your hand, Shirou."
"...?"
I put out my hand.
Tohsaka shakes the can and takes out a reddish candy drop.

"All right, swallow that."
"...?"
I put it in my mouth as instructed.

"...It's not sweet.
No, it has no taste actually.
And this feeling... it feels more like rock than candy.

"...Hmmm..."
I forcibly swallow it down.
"Oh, ouch. My throat hurts. What was that, Tohsaka?"

"It's a jewel, of course. Couldn't you tell by looking at it?"
Straightforwardly.
Tohsaka says something outrageous.

"A jewel, why...!?"
"I can't help it. I prepared some medicine too, but that sort of thing won't work if I want to fix you. So I decided I'd just have to open the switch with the strongest one I have."

"No, that's not the point...! Why are you making me swallow a jewel!? I can't digest something like that!"

"...Hey, now. If you're going to worry about things, you should be worrying about something else. It's not a normal jewel, you know?
What I gave you just now is an enforcement tool that will let you find out about what you didn't know up until now. It should start melting right about now, so be prepared, or you'll faint."

"Why are you telling me I'm gonna faint with"
Just as I say that...
The abnormality hits me.

"!?"
My body is burning.
The feeling in my limbs goes numb.
A lump of heat that can only be described as pain enters my back.
I have to concentrate my mind at my forehead and squeeze it, or I won't be able to stay standing.

"What... is... this?"
I know it.
I know this feeling.
This is a failure.
This is the reaction that happens in my body when I fail to construct a Magic Circuit inside me!

"It's all right. It must be painful, but it should gradually get better if you can maintain that condition. Well, the burning feeling will continue for about two or three weeks though."
...I want to answer her back, but I don't have the energy to do so.
All I can to is try with all my might to stay standing.

"Okay. The difference between a magus and a human is whether they have a switch or not.
You should know that this switch is the toggle for the Magic Circuit.
See, there's an electrical pot that can boil water. A magus is just like that. And a normal person is a pot that can keep the water warm, but can't boil it.

"We are similar, but different.
The question of whether one has the switch or not is beyond the grasp of an individual.
When we are bornno, when we are made, we are separated into insulators and kettles. A person without the switch will never be able to experience magic.

"All right? You're an amateur, but you definitely have a Magic Circuit.
So that means you have the talent. So if you make the Magic Circuit within your body even once, all you have to do after that is to toggle the switch.
You just have to press the switch and switch between on and off to produce magical energy."

...I calm my breathing.
As Tohsaka says, it seems the situation won't get any worse if I calm myself down.

"You only have to make the Magic Circuit once. But you're trying to make the Magic Circuit from scratch and build it into you every time.

"That's just a waste. If you establish it in your body even once, all you have to do is to switch to it.
...Usually, a magus who establishes a Magic Circuit next receives training to switch to it.
But your teacher didn't do that. That's why you're building a Magic Circuit and risking death every time.
...No, maybe your father made the same mistake as well."

I breathe out.
The feelings in my limbs slowly return.

"As you've trained the wrong way for a long time, your switch is closed. If that's the case, all we can do is to open it by force and let your body know that there is a switch."

"See, the jewel just now is something that forces the switch to turn on. So you'll be like that forever. If you want to return to your original state, you'll have to turn it off with your own power.
If you can do that, you won't need the jewel's help anymore. After that, you should be able to handle the Magic Circuit with a simple mental operation."

"...I get... that... but..."
Can't I do anything about the heat in my body?
And she talks about this switch, but what am I supposed to do?

"What, you can speak already!?
...Hmm, you're good at controlling yourself. Then maybe you can return to your normal state rather quickly.
The switch will automatically turn off as your body tries to calm down and tries to get comfortable again.
All you have to do is hasten that process with your will. See, it's easy, right?"

"...No... like I said, I don't understand at all.
You say a switch, but I don't feel anything like that."

"It'll be like that now, but you should be able to get a clear image eventually. It'll be like a button in your head. So all you have to do is switch it on, and you'll be able to open the Magic Circuit easily."

"...I hope so. I just feel really sick right now..."

"I assume so. You always shut your Magic Circuit after you used your strengthening magic, right?
It's the opposite right now and your Magic Circuit is open the whole time. It's like running full speed all the time, so it's naturally painful.
But that's an essential requirement to be able to call yourself a magus. If you're going to fight as a Master, toggling the switch will surely help you out."

"...I know. It was a surprise, but I'm thanking you. You're right. If I can feel this switch thing, it will certainly be a bonus."

"...You understand pretty well. But there's no need to thank me. I'm just helping you because I'm in trouble if the person I'm cooperating with is weak."
Tohsaka looks away.
It must be because my body is burning.
Blankly, I think that the embarrassed Tohsaka is cute.

"...What? What are you staring at my face for?"
"Nothing. I just thought you're not honest."

"...I see. You must have excess energy if you're able to say such things. I can continue teaching if you have that much energy, right?"
Tohsaka approaches me, smiling.

"...Uh."
Hold... on.
Hey, I can barely move my body right now.

"So, try your 'strengthening' again.
You shouldn't be able to control your magical energy right now, but you'll be of no use if you don't get used to that condition.
"It's all right. I brought lots of lamps. I don't know how many times you'll screw up, but I won't let you rest until you succeed in strengthening."

Smiling, she hands the lamp to me, still barely able to move.
"...Uh."
Whoa... this is like telling someone with a 40 degree fever to walk on a long tightrope...

"...Geez. I didn't think I'd give up before you did."
Tohsaka blames me with her glare.

"...I'm sorry."
"My predictions were too optimistic. I never thought you would break all thirty.
...Sorry, but that's it for today's training. There's nothing to use to measure your strengthening any more."

"...Ugh."
But I did try.
I tried hard with a body that's burning like I'm in a boiling kettle.
I tried hard, but it's just that the "strengthening" failed in spite of that.

"...Um. If it's just the glass breaking, you can fix it, right? You fixed the broken glass window before."
"It's impossible. That was something that broke normally. This broke because it couldn't endure your magical energy. Remember that it's hard to affect something that carries the magical energy of another."

"Hm, I see."
"Yeah. ...Don't worry and go rest. I'll call it enough to have turned your switch on today.
I'll teach you the rest when you're able to control it."

"...Phew. I'm glad I can rest, but what will you teach me after this?"

"You can only use strengthening, right? You said that's all you can use, so then, you might be able to take it up to the next level and use 'transformation'.
Have you ever been taught about strengthening, transformation, and projection magic?"

"Hm."
...A little.
Strengthening is used to strengthen something, as the word suggests.
People tend to think of strengthening as hardening something, but it actually strengthens the object's effect.
For example, swords will become sharper and lamps will become brighter.

I don't think I need to explain too much for transformation, either.
For example, you can't create a fire with an edged weapon.
That which attaches abilities beyond the normal effects is called transformation.
And projection I think was

"...? What was projection, Tohsaka? I remember my father talking about it often."

"You know about strengthening and transformation, right? Then I would think you'd naturally know what projection is.
Well, in short, it's magic that reproduces something.
It's not magic that elaborates on something that's already there.
Basically, it's magic that constructs something from nothing, so it's the hardest."

"Oh... but magical energy is used only once, right?
So something made with 'projection' disappears quickly.
Comparing a 'projected' sword made with ten magical energy and a 'strengthened' sword with one magical energy, the 'strengthened' one is stronger.
You only need to work on something that's already there, so strengthening is more efficient.
In that light, projection uses too much magical energy, so it's not a magic that's widely used."

"...Oh, I remember. I think my father was saying something like that. He said something about not doing it because it wasn't worth it."

"That's it. All right, let's finish up if you're done asking questions. ...You seem rather unsteady, so I'll at least take you to your room."

I let her accompany me back to my room.
And Saber is waiting for me at the doorway.

"Well done, both of you."
"......"
I don't even have the energy to respond.
I answer with just a nod and enter my room.

"How is Shirou, Rin?"
"Bad. He's really bad. He doesn't have the talent."
It's a merciless statement, just like Tohsaka.

...And then, when I notice, I'm looking up at the night sky.
Tonight, I didn't run away because I felt uneasy about Saber.
I'm just feeling the night wind, finding my burning body and the things Tohsaka taught me impossible to manage.

"...But once I'm really able to use this switch thing, then the problem is only the procedure.
I'm worried about the future if I'm failing so much at the easiest magic of strengthening..."

I murmur and start to put my magical energy into the plank I brought out from the shed.
A cracking sound.
The strengthening failed as I expected, and the wood has a crack in it.

"...I can even see the structure inside of it, so why can't I control my magical energy?"
Tohsaka said I'm straining too much.
She also said it's fine with just a small amount of magical energy, so I should just think about enforcing the weak spots in the object.
...In short, does she mean I should ease up a bit?

"...I already know that without having to have her tell me."
The problem is, I don't have any way to ease up.
It would be great if there was some good way to relax and
"......"
Footsteps that seem to seep into the night.
This presence rudely approaches me for the second time.

"...What? I don't have any business with you."
"I feel the same way. But it seems Rin is worried about you, so I could not overlook it."

"......"
I throw the plank away, glaring at Archer.
And then, Archer picks up the plank as if he's interested in it.

"Strengthening magic, huh? But it sure is badly done."
"...! Huh, I know I'm just an amateur. I feel bad for putting extra work on your Master."
"No, that is not it. Even Rin is mistaken on this matter."
"Huh...? What do you mean by"

"Huh, work on something that is already there? That's aiming too high. You are not skilled enough to do such a thing."
"Wha...!"

He's saying what he likes when I'm letting him...! ...But he is so correct, I can't answer.
It's true that I'm unskilled, and it's my fault that I cannot succeed at the magic.
It's no good taking it out on this guy.

"What? You don't have the energy you did last night?"
"Shut up. I just stopped talking because you were right.
It's all my fault for not being skilled enough."

I look away.
I don't know how he took it.
"...Hm. Maybe you are unlucky with your teachers in a way."
Archer says so as if he's amazed.

"Huh...? That can't be true. My father and Tohsaka are good at teaching, so it must be me that's a bad student."

"That is why. For you, a magus that doesn't know anything would suit you better.
A genius cannot understand the agony of an ordinary person.
Rin is too good a student to realize the mistake of a dropout."

"...?"
I don't get what Archer wants to say.
I don't get it, but to guess from his words...

"I don't get it, but I think you're looking for a fight."
I'll take it right now, free of charge.
"That is a mistake as well. Emiya Shirou is not fit for fighting.
Because your fight is supposed to be a mental fight, a fight with your own self."

"Hm... you're saying that a fight between magi is a mental fight, right? I already know that. But still, a fight has to be exchange of blows."

"Geez. Saber will be in trouble if you are like that."
Archer looks down at me seriously.
In his eyes are things I haven't seen before... real dejection and anger.

"Listen carefully because I will only say this once.
Look. Emiya Shirou has no chance of winning if it comes down to fighting.
None of your skills will be any use against a Servant."

"...!"
That's something Saber said to me.
She said that no matter what kind of clever scheme I use, Emiya Shirou has no chance of victory in battle.

"In that case, at least imagine it. If it is an opponent you cannot match in real life, beat it in your imagination.
If you cannot beat it yourself, imagine something that you could beat it with.
After all, that is the only thing you can do."

"Wha"
I don't know why.
But it feels like Archer's words naturally pass into me.

I should not forget those words.
I think that what this man is saying is something that should never be forgotten

"...There is something wrong with me advising someone I need to kill. I guess the kindness of Rin has transferred to me."
Archer disappears suddenly.
Archer was just supposed to keep watch.
I bet he jumped back onto the roof where it's fit for keeping watch.

"...What's with him?"
I complain at the guy that disappeared.
There's no reply.
Ruminating on the words that linger horribly in my head, I feel the cold winter air on my burning body.
I get back to the house.
I decide to keep it a secret that I met Ilya.
I know it's something that I should tell her about right away, but I still don't want to tell her about it.

The Ilya I met at the park wasn't a Master.
I talked with Ilya about trifling matters and we parted in a trifling manner as well.
So I'm hesitant to tell others about what happened today.
...I feel guilty since it's like I'm hiding something from them, but it's because I don't want to think of the Ilya I met today as my enemy.

After eating lunch with Saber, we continue to train at the dojo. And before I know it, it's time for dinner already.
I rest my tired body and take a bath to wash my sweat off.
And when I go to the living room, dinner is prepared.


I'm a bit moved.
It's nice having dinner ready without me doing anything when I come out of the bath.

"Emiya-kun, it's dinnertimewhat are you doing standing there like an idiot? Is it dementia?"
But.
Why does she have to say something that totally destroys the moment?

"Nothing. Dinner, right? I'll eat it gratefully. Where's Saber?"
"Mn? I guess Saber-san went to Shirou's room. Didn't you see her? That's weird, she was here until a second ago."

"Maybe you two missed each other since this place is as complicated as a hotel. All right, I'll go get Saber, so you should go to the bathroom again. Your hair isn't completely dry yet."

"Oh, you're right. Sorry, then I'll leave Saber to you."
I wave my hand to Tohsaka and return to the hallway.

As Tohsaka said, the Emiya house has many paths because of the aimless reconstruction.
The worst one is the route to the bathroom, and it really is like a hotel because you can get there from my room or from the living room.

I enter the bathroom.
I don't like hair driers, so I'll use the towel I used before.

In an instant.
I forget everything that happened today.

"Shirou."
I hear a voice.
The figure in front of me is saying something.

"It seems you are here to take a bath again, but I am using it at the moment. It would be helpful if you could reserve yourself for now."
She says so without hesitation.

"Uh, uh, auh, ah."
I have to explain.
I know I have to explain to her that this is an accident, but my head is totally blank.
After all, this had enough impact to make me forget everything that happened today.

"S, s-s, s-s-s-s-s-s-"
"Shirou, have you been in the bath too long? Even your ears are red. If you would like to cool down, you should go to the porch."
"Uh, yeah, I'll do so. But I have to apologize first."

I look away from Saber and calm my pounding heart.

"This was an accident. I wasn't trying to look at your naked body. No, I can't ask you to forgive me from the moment we met like this, so you can get angry at me."
"...?"
I say so while trying to look down and calming myself the best I can.

Saber thinks for a while.
"Shirou, please raise your head."
She says in her usual manner.

"Uh... yeah."
I raise my head as she tells me to.
"...!! Why are you still like that...!?"
In front of me is Saber, still as she was before.

"It is nothing you should apologize for. I would like to say that there is nothing you should be worried about just from seeing something like my bare body."

"Ahhuh?"
"I have told you before. The Servant's gender is meaningless.
It seems you are in a panic because you saw my body as a woman, but I am a Servant before I am a woman. So I believe such consideration is unnecessary."

"Wha?"
What is she saying?
No, even if Saber herself says that, it doesn't change the fact that she's really feminine.
...Or could it be?
I have an idea, but is it true...?

"...I'll ask, but don't tell me you're not embarrassed by people seeing your body."
"...? Why would I need to be embarrassed?"

I thought so.
...But even if she doesn't care, I'll definitely go insane.

"...I'm sorry. Anyways, I'm going to apologize. If anything like this happens again, you can do what you want with me."
I turn around 180 degrees and exit the dressing room awkwardly.

"...?"
Saber looks at me in her usual manner until I disappear.
Even after lunch, we do the same things.
I wholeheartedly exchange shinai blows with Saber.
The training that should continue until Tohsaka or Fuji-Nee gets home is...
...Interrupted by a doorbell to let me know a visitor is here.

"Shirou, it seems there is a visitor."
"Yeah, I heard it. I'll go, so please stay here."
"...No. There is a possibility that it is an unwanted visitor. I shall accompany you, just in case."
"Hm."
What Saber says is plausible.

...It is, but if the visitor happens to be a neighbor, there is a chance they'll get suspicious of Saber.
Because it's supposedly just me living in this house.
But....

"Well, what happens will be what happens."
Sakura and Fuji-Nee come here often, so I shouldn't start worrying about public image now.

"All right, come on, Saber. But please stay quiet if the visitor's a normal person."
"I know. I am to be your distant relative, is that right?"
"Yeah, that's good."

"Yeah, I'm coming!"
Hurried by the doorbell, I open the entrance door.

"Excuse me. I heard you were not feeling well, so I came to see how you were doing, Emiya."
Instead.
The visitor is not some enemy or some neighbor, but a friend from school.

"Oh, it's just you, Issei."
"It's rude to say that. Is that an appropriate attitude to take towards a friend who has come to see you?"
Complaining, Issei hands me a paper bag.

"Hm? What's this? Apples?"
"It's a get-well gift. When the person who usually never gets sick is absent from school, I should at least bring something."

"Hm."
I'm grateful for his concern, but I'm not absent because I'm sick.
...And also, it seems wrong for a young student to bring a bag of apples for a sick friend.

"What, Emiya? Don't you like fruit?"
"Oh, I like them. Yeah, it's complicated, but I'll accept your good intentions."
I bow in appreciation.

"...Emiya. This is a sudden question, but who is that woman behind you?"
"Huh?"
That said, I turn around.
Of course, Saber followed me here.

"Oh"
I see. Issei must have seen Saber when I bowed.

"...It is not someone I've seen before. Why is such a woman at your house?"
Issei stares rudely at Saber.
He's really bashful in front of strangers and he can be really coldhearted towards strangers or people he dislikes.

"Uh, well, she's called Saber and, um..."
"I am a distant relative of Shirou. I was treated kindly by the master of this house, Kiritsugu, when he was in my country.
I came to sightsee here the other day, and I am staying here thanks to my relation to him."

"Huh?"
Saber smoothly delivers a convincing story.

"So you're an acquaintance of Emiya's father? I hear he loved traveling. I am sure he would have had the chance to meet someone like you."
"What!?"
Ryudou Issei, who's supposedly bashful around strangers, easily accepts the fact.

"I see. I understand your situation, Emiya.
Your sickness is just an excuse and you were showing her around, right?"

"Uhyeah. I guess you could say that."
...Yeah, I guess I'm not lying, on the grand scale.

"Then you won't mind if I intrude. Get me some tea in appreciation for me bringing it back. Let's talk about what has happened at school these past two days."
Issei comes in, taking off his shoes.

"...? What do you mean by appreciation? I'm busy, you know?
Let's talk some other time."
"What are you saying? You left your bike outside our place, right?"

"Oh... yeah, I left my bike at the Ryudou Temple."
"Yes. So I brought you your bike.
Even though I was busy, I went straight home without attending the student council and came here. Are you saying you cannot even give me some tea for that?"

"Ugh."
That's certainly helpful.
Even though I have 3 bicycles, the one I left at the Ryudou Temple is the most expensive one and my favorite.

"...Sorry, Saber. Can we take a little break?"
Saber nods silently.

"Sorry. Could you guys go to the living room? I'll go prepare some tea. Japanese tea for Issei and English tea for Saber, right?"

"Wha... I-I am joining as well!? I-I do not know about that. I do not think you will be able to talk freely with your friend if I am there."

"That's not true. Right, Issei?"
"Right. Girls are loud, but Saber-san is fine. Humble women are a part of our cultural heritage."

"See. So please go ahead."
"Uh... yes. I understand, but Shirou..."

"What? Is there something else?"
"Could I have Japanese tea as well? I do not dislike Japanese tea."
For some reason, Saber says so clearly.
It feels a bit weird, her saying that in her usual manner.

We talk about meaningless things for an hour, then Issei decides to go home.
The conversation we had in the living room was mostly about school, and I asked him tentatively if there was anything strange going on, but it seems school continued as usual.

"I'll see you. Will you be skipping tomorrow as well?"
"Yeah, I can't go to school this week. I have to be with Saber tomorrow again."

"I see. Well, there shouldn't be any problems if you are with that girl. There are suspicious aspects, but they don't even need to be considered."
Issei nods to himself.
...Come to think of it, how was it possible for this guy, so bashful around strangers, not to hate Saber?

"Hey Issei. You were in a good mood even though it was your first time meeting Saber. What's up with that?"
"What are you saying? I grew up in a temple. What would I do if I couldn't tell good from evil? I do not know her origins, but her spirit is pure. She cannot be a bad person."

"Wow. So you can tell that sort of thing? I'm a bit impressed."
"...Well, I can't normally. But even an amateur can tell if it's that great.
Even a monk in training will notice divinity if a Buddha stands next to him. In other words, Saber-san is that beautiful."

...This is rare indeed.
Issei is praising a woman.

"I see. So you like Saber too."
That's good.
I was worried Issei wouldn't like her since all she did was sit there and listen silently.

"Of course. She's a good girl. It's hard to dislike her."
"Yeah. I see she's a good girl, but she's a little antisocial, right? She's always like that, so it doesn't mean she dislikes you."

"Huh? Is she antisocial?"
"She is. She hasn't laughed yet. She's always had a troubled face, even when we were laughing and talking about Fuji-Nee."
"No, she was smiling quite a lot."
"Huh?"

That's ridiculous.
It's true that Saber looks peaceful sometimes.
But when I haven't yet seen her smile even once...!?

"You're lying. I can't imagine Saber busting her sides with laughter."
"...No, it's not like that.
She was smiling when she saw you smile. Didn't you notice?"
?
She was smiling when she saw me smile...?

"...Um. Does that mean she was making fun of me...?"
"I see, you interpret some things rather oddly.
But you should torment yourself on that issue. Everything starts from questioning yourself. Kah!"

With his usual comments, he leaves laughing.
"Hmwhat does he mean?"
He leaves me with only suggestive comments.
At least say goodbye to me, you idiot.


The sounds of the shinais echo.
The substance of the fight is the same as always.

I attack desperately, while Saber blocks my blows easily and counters with an attack twice as sharp as mine.
I manage to block it, attack even stronger, and losewe are repeating the same match over and over.

"HaHaa, haa, hah."
I stand still and breathe deeply.
Wiping the sweat off my forehead with my arm, I calm my breathing.

"What are you resting for? You would not have given up at this point yesterday. Here, come attack me."

"Nohold on. I need to catch my breath. Let's rest a bit."

"What are you saying? If you will not attack, I will just attack. You do not mind that?"
Saber stares at her bad student.
But I cannot move my body to my satisfaction, even if she looks at me that way.

"...Sigh. What has gotten into you, Shirou? You are like a different person from yesterday.
Your blows that came straight for me were the only thing that amazed me, but I do not feel any power from you this morning."

"...I know that myself, but... I just can't do too well."
Well, uh, the situation is too different from yesterday.

"Is the heat in your body still present? But it is no good if your performance decreases just because of that. Please cool down a bit and calm your mind."

"No. Before that, do something about that thing."
I point to the observer by the wall.

"What? Don't mind me and just continue your training."

"......"
Tohsaka doesn't understand at all.
When she's staring at me like that, I can't concentrate on fighting with Saber.

"You are worried about Rin? That proves even more of your lack of training.
"...I understand. In that case, I will make it so that you will not worry about observers."
Saber grips her shinai hard.

"Whoa, hold on Saber, my breath isn't"
"There is no problem. You should fix such a problem during battle."
Saber disappears from my view.

"!"
The instant I realize this is bad and block my face, Saber's shinai hits me right on my head.

...And so, the training this morning was severe.
I wasn't worried about Tohsaka watching after I got knocked out once. As I devoted myself to blocking Saber's blows, it was lunchtime before I knew it.

"But man, Saber really is calm.
You didn't even twitch your brow during the whole three hours you fought with Shirou. You don't talk much normally, but it's even more true when you're in a battle. It feels like you're a machine or something."

Tohsaka is in a good mood, I think because she saw me getting beat around a lot.
The two are in the living room, resting.
As for me, I'm preparing lunch by myself as a punishment for not being serious this morning.
...Geez.
I want to cut corners and finish quickly by making something like white noodles.

"Machine-like...? I see, I have never been conscious of it, but I may be turning off my emotions while I wield the sword. It must be the same even in training."

"Hmm. Could that be in preparation for holding a sword even though you're a girl? Like, not losing in spirit because you're inferior in physique?"

"That is incorrect, Rin. Being calm is part of readiness for battle, but that should be no different for a man or a woman.
Even you should shut down your emotions during battle. You are the kind who is able to."

"Hm... you're pretty direct. Well, it's true, though.
But yours is definitely different from mine. I only shut out my generosity. I can't be as objective as you are."

"It seems so. That must be why you are so gorgeous.
You keep the elegance of a woman even during battle."

"What, is that sarcasm? I can't beat you in gorgeousness. ...I'll admit it since Shirou is way over there, but I was fascinated by your beauty when I first saw you."
...No, I can hear you, Tohsaka.

"You must have been misunderstanding. If my figure looked gorgeous, it must be that my class of Saber looked gorgeous."

"That's not it. I just felt like I've lost as a woman. ...I wouldn't have been so shocked otherwise."

"...I am saying that you are mistaken. I have never thought of myself as a woman, and I have never been treated as one.
It cannot be true that I am gorgeous."

Saber's comment stops the conversation.

As I use the kitchen knife, I feel irritated by Saber's comment.

"...I've been wondering for a while, but just what does she think she is?"
I take a big swing at the chicken meat.
For some reason, I'm getting annoyed.

I have never thought of myself as a woman

"Heh. It's none of my business...!"
I strike hard at the cutting board with my knife.
But doing so doesn't make me feel even one bit better.

"These are today's task.
We've got more than yesterday and you seem calmer today, so you should succeed."

I don't know how she brought them here, but Tohsaka brings out about forty lamps.

"I'm going outside. I'll be back in a while, so finish up by then."
Saying goodbye, Tohsaka leaves the room.

"Sigh."
Well.
Yesterday night was bad, so I should at least succeed at one or two tonight.

"...Phew. Half done, for now."
It took me one hour to try "strengthening" on about twenty lamps.
Half of them broke, and the other half showed no change.
But out of the ones that didn't break, five of them had magical energy successfully channeled into them. All I have to do now is to challenge the twenty that are left, but

"...... Hold on. Maybe five is enough as a test?"
It seems like all the lamps are antiques.
I feel bad about breaking any more of them.

"...Hmm."
Yeah, I should
Let's go and get Tohsaka.
I shouldn't break any more lamps.
...Well, I don't think that's much of an excuse for someone that already broke forty lamps...

"Hey Tohsaka..."
There's no reply even when I call out.
...That's weird, maybe she's not in the house.
The only other place Tohsaka could be is

"...There's someone in the shed."
It seems Saber and Tohsaka are inside, talking.
"Hey, Tohsa"
As I raise my hand to call out to her...

I feel a chill run through me.
...I think it was a wave of Tohsaka's magical energy filled with enmity, that came flowing out from the shed.

"!"
The voice that was calling out to her stops.
...It seems Tohsaka is so irritated that I can feel it from way over here.


Their conversation can be heard.
Without realizing it, I'm eavesdropping on them.

"Just who is he?"
Tohsaka murmurs in a tone that could be angry or horrified.
Saber is standing silently behind her.

"I can't believe it. Saber, you knew about this...?"
"...No, I did not know. I am a knight, not a magus. There was only an odd feeling here, so I do not understand the situation as well as you do."

"I see. Then I'll tell you. He's not a magus at all."
In a voice filled even with hatred,Tohsaka spits those words out.

"...Rin. What does that mean?"
"Just like it sounds.
Magic is an equivalent exchange after all. No matter what kind of magic it is, it can only bring what's elsewhere here to use it."

"...But this is different. He's bringing something that comes from nowhere. He's forming something that should not exist here.
That can only be a concept that violates reality.
His magic is probably a deteriorated version of that one magic."

"......"
I don't understand what Tohsaka is talking about.
But this is something that I should not be listening to.
...I get away from the shed.
I'll be lying to Tohsaka, but I should return to the room and pretend I was waiting for her return
No, I'll stay here obediently.
Tohsaka must have gone outside for a reason, so I should handle the part assigned to me.

"...Right. After yesterday's mistakes, I should succeed at as many as possible today."
I face the lamps with renewed spirit.
There's twenty more left. I should finish them up before Tohsaka gets back.
It's two o'clock.
There's no sign of Tohsaka returning, and I diligently finish the task assigned to me.

"Oh, phone call."
The phone is ringing far away.

"...It's the living room. Tohsaka iswait, it's a call at my place, so she shouldn't answer it."
I don't think it's important, but I can't just ignore it.
I get up and head to the living room to pick up the phone.

There's no one in the living room.
Saber and Tohsaka must be somewhere else, like in the yard.

"Yes, this is Emiya."
"Hey Emiya. It seems you're absent again today. Are you sick or something?"
As soon as I pick up.
I hear Shinji's voice, mixed with hidden laughter.

"Shinji? Do you want something? I don't think there's anything to talk about."
"Don't be angry. I just called to tell you something."

"...Tell me something...?"
"Yeah. There's something I needed to tell you, but you never came to school.
I don't want to wait any longer and I can't stand it, so I contacted you. ...So, is Tohsaka there?"

...Shinji's tone is strange.
I can't tell much from just his voice, but he sounds like he's really excited or pressured.

I can hear students in the background, so he must still be at school.
It's past two. It must be break time right after the fifth period.

"Hey, I'm asking you, Emiya. Is Tohsaka there or not?"[r]
"...She's not here right now. She's gone at the moment."
"Oh, that's great. I wanted to talk just between us. I'll tell you something good, so come to school now. Keep it a secret from Tohsaka, of course."


I don't know how to answer.
Shinji is acting strange, and anyway, we're already talking.
There's no need to go to school, and going there without telling Tohsaka would mean betraying her.

"No. I'm sorry, but I can't go to school. If you have some business with me, wait until next week. I'll go back to school after the weekend."
"...Huh? What are you being so selfish for?
That's too late. I just told you I can't wait any longer...!"

Shinji screams at me.
He must be excited as I can hear his heavy breathing even over the phone.

"...Huh. I guess you're thinking a bit. You're right, there's no way you'd come by yourself now. This call sounds too strange no matter how you take it. I guess even you found it strange."
Completely changing, he laughs.

"Hold on. Calm down, you're acting weird. I don't know what happened, but"

"Ahahahaha! Don't lie, Emiya. It's Tohsaka, she would have told you everything. You don't have to hide it. You're right, you're Saber's Master. That means you're a better murderer than I am...!"

Shinji sounds cheerful.
...I've known him for five years now, but I've never seen him this high.

"Shinji, you..."
"Anyways, I'll be waiting at school. Hurry up, Emiya. You should make it in time for sixth period if you leave now. It's Fujimura's class, so there won't be a problem if you're late."

"No, even Fuji-Nee would get mad if I was late. And if I go there for only the sixth period, I get the feeling I'd be scolded more than if I skipped the whole day."

"That's your own fault. Oh, and if you tell Tohsaka, I'll really end our friendship. I let you go about Sakura until now. You can at least fulfill your duty as a friend in the end, right?"

The conversation ends there.
The phone is repeating a boring beeping sound.

"What's with him?"
...But what should I do?
I haven't been able to find Tohsaka in the house, and if I'm going to school, I can't take Saber.
Still, I'm worried what Shinji will do if I refuse his invitation.

He seems distraught after being refused by Tohsaka last night, and he might hit Sakura again if I leave him be.

"...Right. It's still light out, so there should be no problems."
If that's decided, I should hurry.
I'll make it for sixth period if I run.

There's no one at the school gates.
As it's classtime, it looks from outside like the school is empty.
There must not be any PE classes at the moment, as nobody is out in the yard either.

Well, this will all change in a little while.
School's over once sixth period ends.
The schoolyard and the gate should be filled with students.

I reach the third floor.
Of course, the hallway is empty as well.
Class is in session, and it feels a bit awkward walking to class C like this.

"...Well, it's not like I'm completely visible, so let's hurry to the classroom."
Class C is down the hallway.
This class by the stairs is class H, so I'll have to walk past five classes to get there

"Eh?"
The dizziness hits me suddenly.
It attacks my whole body with nausea.
"Haguh."
My stomach crawls around.
My senses are reversed.
My vision is filled with crimson.
As if blood has seeped into my eyes, everything in my vision tints red.
"Haah, guh...!!"
The temperature hasn't changed, but my body is strangely hot.
"What... is this!?"
My feet tremble.
I can't put any power into my body.
I'm weakening like an hourglass, unable to stop it.
It's as if I'm breathing out my insides with every breath.
"Kuh, ...!"
I'm suffocating.
My throat hurts.
Could it be that the oxygen has disappeared from the hallway, no, from the whole school?
As if urged by my gasping lungs, I lean against the wall and open the window unconsciously.
"Wha?"
My mind freezes.
The scale of the situation erases even my confusion.
Outside the window.
Around the schoolyard is a field of red.
It's as if only this school is cut out, surrounded by a red world.
The school building is an altar covered by a red canopy.
And with that, finally...
I understand that this is "that kind of a thing".
"!"
I move away from the window.
Holding my wobbling legs firm with my will, I enter the classroom in front of me.
Inside is the result.
There are no students sitting in their chairs.
All the students are on the floor, and the teacher that was probably standing on the platform is lying on the ground as well.
They are still breathing.
Everyone is convulsing as if asking for help.
There are no fatalities yet.
It's just that they don't have the power to stand up, and they'll soon rot away.
Seeing their miserable condition on the floor...
...I even think that they look like scattered garbage.
"Ahguh"
My nausea gets stronger.
But I deal with it calmly.
I observe the students on the floor.
Even though it's hard to breathe, it doesn't mean they can't breathe.
If they are only weakened, I can still save them if I hurry.
And the instant I check the face of a student nearby, a sound goes *click* inside my head.
"The... skin..."
It's melting.
Not everyone, though.
There must be individual differences, as the most weakened students are starting to have their skin melt away.
Oozing.
Inflamed arms like a keloid, and eyes that look like that of a dead fish.

I know this.
I know a scene like this.
"Stop."
This is just hell.
I know it from a long time ago.
"So, stop."
And so, eclipsing fear,Anger overtakes my body.
"...!"
My left arm throbs.
The Command Spell on my hand tells me an "enemy" is nearby.
"Hah, ah...!"
I run, still breathing hard.
My mind has already gone insane.
"Hey Emiya. Thank God you look better than I thought.
How is it? Do you like this idea?"
Across the hallway.
Matou Shinji is standing right in front of class C.

My arm throbs.
The Command Spell tells me that the man standing there is the cause of this.

"This is your doing, Shinji?"
Unable to breathe properly, I stand there and glare at Shinji's distant figure.
...He must really like how I'm acting.
Shinji spreads his arms exaggeratedly and laughs aloud in the red hallway.

"That's right. I knew you were here, so I quickly activated the boundary field. I had trouble getting the right timing, you know? You'd have run away if I did it too early, and we'd have met up if I did it too late.
As for me, I wanted to see you go pale, so I didn't want to make this too simple."

"I see. So you were lying about having something to talk about."
"Talk? That starts now. I have to show Tohsaka which one of us is superior, and I also have to apologize for lying to you.
See, I didn't tell you, but I'm the one that set up the boundary field at school."

Ahahaha, Shinji laughs cheerfully.

That...
Makes me realize from the bottom of my heart.

"Huh? You're not as surprised as I thought you'd be. What, I told you the boundary field wasn't mine, but I guess you didn't believe me. ...Haha, that's great. That means for once, even you didn't believe someone!"
His laugh drills into my skull.


I'll make this clear, but I'm surprised enough.
I was only prepared for the discovery that the Master who constructed the boundary field was either Shinji or this other Master.

That's all.
This is the result of the optimistic view.
Back thenas soon as I figured out Shinji was a Master, I should have settled this matter.
So this is my mistake.

"...Shinji, why did you set up something like this? Were you lying when you said you had no intention of fighting?"

"Nope, it's true, isn't it? I didn't intend to activate it either. This was only for negotiation.
If I set a bomb, Tohsaka won't attack me so readily, and it can be my trump card in case something happens."

"...I see. But Tohsaka said the boundary field needed a few more days' preparation. Was her estimate wrong?"

"Heh, I knew she'd think like that. The boundary field is not complete, but its shape is already there, you know? There's no problem just activating it.
Well, the effect is lower because of that. It should take at least a few more minutes to kill anyone."

"Stop."
The nausea has already gone away.
I say so, staring directly at Shinji.

"Stop? Stop what? Don't tell me you're telling me to stop this boundary field. That'll be such a waste. I can't just stop something I've already started."

"Stop. Do you know what you're doing?"

"...You're annoying me. Are you ordering me around?
This is my power. The only one who can decide whether or not to stop it is me, and if you want it stopped, isn't it logical to at least kneel and beg to me?
Geez, you and Fujimura, you guys don't know your positions."

"Hey. What about Fuji-Nee?"

"Huh? Oh, Fujimura? She could move pretty well after I activated this boundary field. Everyone else was falling to the ground, but she was still wobbling, you know?
And she came to me, still upright, and told me to call for an ambulance. It's amazing, wouldn't you say she's a model teacher?"

"But I shouldn't call for something like that, and I don't even want to. That Fujimura kept clinging to me and it got annoying, so I kicked her and she ended up not moving at all!
Hahaha, in that state, I think she'll die first!"


I've switched over completely.
Tohsaka said something about pushing a switch in my head, but it's not like that.
Clang.
A hammer strikes in my head and the inside of my body completely changes.

"This is your last warning. Stop the boundary field, Shinji."
"You don't get it, do you? The more you ask me, the less I feel like stopping the boundary field. If you dislike it so much, why don't you stop me by force?"
"I see. Then it's simple."
So basically.
I need to stop him before I can stop this boundary field.

My body leaps.
My body is burning like a fire.
There's less than twenty meters between me and Shinji.
For me right now, that will only take an instant.
My body is full of energy vastly higher than when I have a Magic Circuit inserted in me.

"Ha, you really are stupid!"
The shadow wiggles.
The shadow settled in the corner of the hallway starts to take form and move.
A sharp edge made of black.
Like a guillotine to cut anything that approaches Shinji.


I don't know what kind of magic it is.
There are three shadows.
With that number
There's no need to stop.
No matter how strong it may be, it's useless if it can't hit me.

The three sharp edges approach me.
"You're the stupid one, Shinji...!"
An attack like this is easily avoidable compared to Saber's attack!

"Wha...!?"
I pass through the opening between the three shadows.
There's nothing dangerous about them.
I felt no threat in the shadows.

So there's no problem.
Saber has taught me that if it doesn't make me sense death, I should not hesitate.
I can't block them myself.
No, I can manage to avoid them.
But if I am to dodge and attack Shinji, I don't know if my body will move well enough to do so.

The three sharp edges approach me.
"Fuh...!"
I stop in my tracks and concentrate on avoiding the attack, while watching Shinji.

Taking a step to the left, I dodge the edge that jumps to stab my stomach.
I turn my upper body to avoid the second one that tries to assault my chest from the left side, and avoid the third attack that reaches for my forehead by taking a step forward.

"No problem, I can see them clearly...!"
Such attacks are like dodgeball compared to Saber's attacks.

"Damn...! You're insolent...!"
He fires three shadows once again.
I don't even need to keep watch this time.
I know its range and speed now from the first attack. I can avoid them with no trouble!

I pass through the opening between the three shadows.
There's nothing dangerous about them.
I feel no threat in the shadows.
Saber has taught me that if it doesn't make me sense death, I should not hesitate.
"Shinji!"
I close in on him.
There're no shadows to protect him.
A few more steps, if I close three more meters, I can

"Stop, don't come near me...!"
Shinji runs away.
The instant I reach out to his back...
"!"
I feel a chill run through my whole body, and I quickly withdraw my extended arm.

Something cuts through the air.
A sharp black edge cuts through the space I was in a moment ago.

"...!"
I stop.
I don't know where it came from, but in front of me...

...Is a woman in black who makes even the red seem faint.

"Ah"
My mind stops in fear.
I'll be killed.
I don't want to think about it, but an image of my head being ripped off pops into my head.
This is...
...A sense of death that the previous shadows cannot even compare to.

"G-Good, Rider...! Don't restrain yourself, you can do what you like with him...!"

Rider's figure becomes vague.
I
I have no chance of winning against a Servant.
I'll certainly be killed if I fight.
So all I can do is to beat Shinji before that and make Rider retreat...!

"Hah...!"
I kick the floor, not being pushed back by Rider's pressure.
There's only six meters to Shinji.
If I can avoid Rider even once, I'll be able to run and get Shinji...!

The Servant in black stands in my way.
I concentrate my senses to her every move so I can react to any attack.
Her target is my left side.
Her left fist made a small motion. I manage to dodge her first attack, go through the space between Rider and the wall, and run toward Shinji.

Her figure disappears.

"Eh...?"
My plan to go through the opening is meaningless.
Rider's figure disappears from my view in an instant, and in front of me is an open path.

This is bad.
I have to stop myself.
I screwed up. Saber told me that many times, but I still did not get it.
I can't go forward.
I can't face Rider.
Even if it's just one blow, I shouldn't have made a plan that required me to dodge a blow...!

The impact comes from behind me.
Rider, sticking to the ceiling like a spider, stabs my afterbrain with a blow following a crescent track.

"Phewbuh..."
Air leaks out from my neck.
The movement of Rider's arm was really beautiful.
It had grace as if it were touching a daffodil.
With a movement of fingers that would not cause even a ripple in water, she has taken away my life.
"Ha, ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
What is that!? You're just like a specimen sample! That's awesome, your neck is making great sounds...!"
"I have gone easy on him. I believe he can still be saved if you heal him."
"...Hey, what are you doing, making choices on your own? Who said to go easy on him? ...Geez, Servants shouldn't give opinions to their Master."
My blood flows out.
No matter how much I move my lungs, I can't breathe in and my throat only wheezes.

"Then you have no intention of saving this person?"
"Nope. First of all, I can't use any healing magic. He's just going to die, so let him be at ease."
"I understand. I shall not melt him in my boundary field. I shall quench my thirst directly."

A heavy metallic sound echoes.
...My body is lifted a little.
"...Ah."
...She is staring at my bloody neck.
The Servant in black opens her mouth delicately and...
...Bites into my neck as if kissing it.

My blood is being sucked.
My already scarce blood is sucked up by Rider, not leaving a drop.


My mind starts to fade.
...This bloodsucking is like euthanasia.
I feel no pain, and as if slowly being melted by spider's poison, I
"!"
I retreat instantly.
Now is not a good time.
I have to regroup, and make Shinji stop the boundary field after that

"Gah...!?"
I desperately retreat, not knowing what's going on.

"Ha, ah, ah...!"
My vision turns white from fear.
I don't even know what I'm scared of.
But I raise my hand, still not knowing what's going on, and block my neck.

"Zu...!"
A sharp object is thrust into my arm.
The dull sound that scrapes my bone tells me I will be killed next.

"Hah, kuh!"
I run.
I don't even have time to turn my back.
I cover only my vitals with my hands and retreat desperately.

"Hihgih...!!!!!"
The sound of cutting echoes through the hallway.
With an annoying sound, the sharp object cuts my body apart.
My vision is blocked by the spray of blood coming out of my body.
Beyond it...
...Is Rider coming at me at a speed I can't even see.

"Gih...!"
Every time I get cut, a voice that doesn't seem like my own escapes my mouth.
But I still continue desperately to retreat, saving my life from numerous fatal blows.

"HaHah, hah, ah!"
I don't know what I'm doing.
My arm is blocking Rider's dagger.
My clothes are ripped apart, and my flesh is as well.
But it must still be working as a shield as it desperately blocks the blows coming at my neck, forehead, and heart.

Force of will is not there.
My body reacts to Rider's blow purely from not wanting to die.

"AhAh, ha"
I'm already out of breath.
I'm only running because I'm being hurried by the presence of death in front of me.
I will just run out of strength, get caught, and die.

"Guhah!"
That's why she told me.
She told me not to fight against Servants, and that I would be no match for them.
Even though I listened to her, whywhat am I doing now? I have to catch Shinji quickly and have him remove the boundary field, so what am I doing!?

"What are you doing, Rider?
That's enough. Just kill him now. He won't be able to do anything anyway."
Shinji's voice is filled with triumph.
Nodding, Rider swings her dagger in a large arc.

A blow directed at my head.
I cannot dodge it.
All I can do is to stop it hitting a fatal point.

"...!"
The dagger stabs me in my shoulder, right below my collarbone.
A loud metallic sound, and the cluck of a tongue.
"Huh...?"
What is this...? The end of Rider's dagger is breaking apart

"This is surprising. I cannot kill him with my dagger."
Rider stops.
In the instant that I consider how to make use of that opening...
"Then, die falling."
I feel an impact like being hit with a sledgehammer, and I'm knocked out the window.

"Gah"
I only took a roundhouse kick to the stomach.
But that blows my body away and I'm thrown out of the window.
It's the third floor.
I should die from loss of blood even without anything, so falling from this height should finish me off.

No, I should have died the moment I received the blow that flung me a few dozen meters.
"Ah."
I reach out.
Maybe I'm not falling yet, or it's just an illusion.
My body is still in the air.

"Ahh..."
I reach out my arm, as if to cling onto something.
The sky is red.
The school building is throbbing as if it's the stomach of a living thing.
Am I...
...Going to die overlooking something like this?

Like this?
Like this?
Like this?
Like thisam I going to die selfishly, unable to save anybody!?

"Why"
I grit my teeth in vain.
I cannot beat her. I cannot even be a match. I knew that, but I made a mistake.

I don't care about the pain in my body.
I'm just going insane from the anger.
This is the result of...
...Saying I can handle things myself, and saying I won't let Saber fight.


I was the stupid one.
I can't save anyone by myself.
If I really wanted to end this war, there was just one thing to do from the beginning.

He said it.
If I am to not fight anybody, not kill anybody, or not let anyone kill...
That if I realized I was wrong, I should decide what to correct and what to punish.

And so.
On my arm, reaching out as if to grab the heavens, is the Command Spell waiting for my order
"Please, come."

I murmur as if praying.
I don't care about my life.
But only to stop the cause of this....
"NoI order you to come, SABER!!!!"
With all my might, I call for my sword.

A Command Spell disappears.
And at the same moment, a winding occurs in space.

It must have been sorcery.
Because Saber in her silver armor shoots forth from it, as if breaking through the ripple in space.

"Gah...!"
I fall to the ground on my back.

"Ahha, ah...!"
My breath stops.
My organs will explode from the impact.
A few of my ribs must have broken or at least cracked.

"Ah"
But still.
My body did not break apart, and my bloody arms are still attached.

"Shirou...!"
...Saber runs toward me.
Forcing my numb arms and legs, I manage to stand up to show her I'm all right.

"I don't have time to explain. You know the situation, right Saber?"
"Hold on Shirou. I understand, but first, your body needs to"
"Please go get Rider. Only you can beat her."

"No, your treatment comes first. You will die like this."
"That's wrong. There's something that needs to be done before that."
Forget about me, as we have to beat Shinji and Rider as quickly as possible.
Nothing takes priority over that.

"But that's..."
Saber is stubbornly worried about my body.
...I would be lying if I said I wasn't happy about it.
But we don't have time to argue.
If Saber doesn't want to, I'll just have to use my second Command Spell.

"...!"
My determination must have got through to her.
Saber accepts my decision.

"I understand. Please give me an order, Master."
"Defeat Rider. I'll get Shinji."
There's no hesitation in Saber now.
She nods silently and runs to the school building like the wind.
"Sa... ber"
I wish for her help.
In the space between the sky and the ground, in the sea of thought, like time has stopped, I wish upon the Command Spell on my left hand.

One more second until the ground.
Believing that she can overturn this death unavoidable by normal logic...
"Please come, Saber...!"
With all my might, I call for my sword.

A Command Spell disappears.
And at the same time, a winding occurs in space.

It must have been sorcery.
Because Saber in her silver armor shoots forth from it, as if breaking through the ripple in space.

"Master!?"
The silver armor runs toward me.
Saber appears suddenly in the school grounds, sees me falling before she is surprised by this event, and...
"Fu...!"
...Catches me just before I hit the ground.

"Ah... guh... Sorry, Saber. You saved me."
I manage to get onto the ground, still bloody.
Even though I escaped the fall, my body, lacerated by Rider, is way past its limit.

"Haah...!"
But I cannot fall down.
Forcing my numb arms and legs to move, I manage to stand up to show her that I'm all right.

"I don't have time to explain. You know the situation, right Saber?"
"Wait, Shirou. I understand, but first your body needs to"
"Please go get Rider. Only you can beat her."

"No, your treatment comes first. You will die like this."
"That's wrong. There's something that needs to be done before that."
Forgetting about me, we have to beat Shinji and Rider as quickly as possible.
Nothing takes priority over that.

"But that's..."
Saber is stubbornly worried about my body.
...I would be lying if I said I wasn't happy about it.
But we don't have time to argue.
If Saber doesn't want to, I'll just have to use my second Command Spell.

"...!"
My determination must have got through to her.
Saber accepts my decision.

"I understand. Please give me an order, Master."
"Defeat Rider. I'll get Shinji."
There's no hesitation in Saber now.
She nods silently and runs to the school building like the wind.
No, I can't use my Command Spell here.

My mind hesitates for an instant.
As I'm an unskilled Master, the Command Spell is a trump that I can only use three times.
Right after I calmly analyze that I can't use it without giving it more thought...

"?"
I fall on my back.
I fall onto the ground, after being kicked off the third floor.
It's fatal. Well, it's effectively fatal.
I blocked my fall to avoid hitting my head, but it would have been enough to break every bone in my body.

"Why?"
I'm bleeding.
A ridiculous amount of blood is pouring out of me.
But it's all coming from my chest.
My back is fine, and I've endured the impact of the fall, so why?

Why is such a strange
                          thing
                             sticking out of my chest?

"Haguh."
My chest is open.
Something like the blade of a sword is bursting from inside my chest to outside.

It's as if a bomb was set in my body and it went off from the impact of the fall.
"SaSaber"
I don't know why.
My chest has holes in it.
Like a rib sticking out, a group of swords is sticking out from my stomach.

My body starts to melt slowly while I blankly stare at it.
"AAh. Quick, I have... to... stop it"
My body won't move.
The miracle that cured even that blow from Berserker doesn't seem to have any effect on these swords.

My thoughts are being cut apart.
Even if I want to use the Command Spell, my left hand has already melted.

"......"
I breathe in just once.
The air I breathe in is painful.
And coughing up regurgitated blood, my heart stops.
I run up the stairs.
Rider and Shinji are on the third floor.
I can tell from the Command Spell's reaction that Shinji is still on the third floor.

The instant I get to the third floor, sparks fly out.
"Rider...!?"
I couldn't see it, but Saber must have seen Rider attacking from above and deflected her attack.
"Shirou, I will defeat Rider here.
Please take care of Rider's Master...!"

She doesn't need to tell me.
Saber won't be beaten by Rider.
That's something I'm sure of from fighting Rider and knowing even a little about her power.
Saber's power vastly exceeds that of Rider.

"I'll leave it to you...! But don't go too far. It'll all end if I stop Shinji...!"
I pass Saber and run.
Rider's dagger instantly comes to kill me, and Saber attacks to deflect it along with Rider!

I run through the hallway.
In front of me is Shinji, completely flustered.
"...I guess I'm at a disadvantage barehanded!"
A long object that can serve as a weapon, likethe mop in this locker...!

"Trace, on."
I pass my magical energy through it as I run.
Perhaps I don't have any other thoughts or I don't have enough energy to do anything else.
But I "strengthen" the plastic mop as naturally as breathing.

The shadows move.
Even though I'm hurt so badly, I don't feel any sluggishness in my body.

And on top of that, I have a weapon now.
So...

I don't even need to dodge them now.
I smack away all the shadows attacking me using the mop.
The mop breaks, but that's to be expected from a weapon so hurriedly constructed.
And besides, there's no need for anything like that when I'm this close.

"Shinji!"
"Hii!"

I punch him straight on.
My slashed arm hurts so much that it almost knocks me unconscious.

I punch Shinji in the stomach and drive him against the wall.
"Guh, you...!"
Shinji reaches out to fling my arms off.
I kick his arms away without hesitation.
Even I can't control myself.
I take the arm that I kicked and ram it against the wall, and break it.

"Ahiaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!"
I can't hear Shinji's scream too clearly.


...Crap.
I'll faint if I let my guard down.
I have to hurry, while my body can still move

"Hii...!"
I grab Shinji's hair and push him up against the wall.

"Scream later. Stop the boundary field right now, Shinji."
"W-Who are you kidding. Who would listen to... your..."
I take my other arm and grab his throat.
Drips.
The blood soaked into my clothes stains Shinji's body.

"Then I'll just kill you before the boundary field. I don't care which it is. Make up your mind quickly."
I put power into the hand grabbing his throat.
It must be because of the magical energy flowing through my body.
I feel like I'd be able to break this neck.

"Hayou're lying. You wouldn't be able to do that. A-And I haven't killed anyone yet. I just had everyone share their life with"
"Okay. Bye, Shinji."

I tighten my grip.
There's no hesitation.
Just a little sympathy.
It's because Shinji wasn't taught the basic rules of magithat there's no problem with killing other magi.

"H-Hold on! Hold on, all right, I lose...! I'll stop the boundary field right now...!"
"......"
I loosen my grip on his throat.

"Haa, haa, haa... damn it. ...Hey, Rider! Stop your Bloodfort!
Your Master's life's in danger...!"
Shinji screams to Rider in the distance.


There's no response from Rider.
But Saber takes a step back from Rider with those words.
Rider lowers her dagger and moves her lips slightly.

"...This is okay, right? I guess this boundary field is special, so it seems it's hard to reconstruct a boundary field somewhere she's already constructed one.
...I won't make another boundary field here, so let go."

"Who would do that? Since I won, I'll have you obey me. Shinji, get rid of your Command Spells. Then we'll never have to fight again."

"Whatdon't be ridiculous, how can I do something like that!?
I won't be able to control Rider if I lose my Command Spell. If that happens, I'll"

"You won't be a Master anymore, right? So you can just go to the church in Shinto. It seems it's a place that shelters Masters who have dropped out of the battles.
...Or what? Were you lying when you said you constructed this boundary field to protect yourself, and you actually constructed this to beat the other Masters?"

"...I didn't say that. I just thought that if I became a Master and worked with a Servant..."
He thought he'd be able to be a magus?
...But what would be the point even if he became one?

"This is it, Shinji. If you won't get rid of your Command Spell, I'll have that arm cut off. I hear you'll lose your right to be a Master if that happens."
"Huh...? Cut off my arm...?"

Shinji questions like it's a real mystery.
He's not faking it. It seems he really doesn't understand what I'm saying.

"Well, it's"
"Shirou, get away...!"
Saber's voice.
Maybe it's the result of training at the dojo, but my body reacts to Saber's voice before my brain.

I let go of Shinji and jump back.
And at the same time, Rider's dagger is swung through the space I used to occupy.

"R-Rider...!?"
"Please stay back, Master. We shall retreat from here."

"Please stay back, Shirou...! Rider intends to release all the magical energy she was using to maintain the boundary field...!"

"...!? Release her magical energy...!?"
Looking at Rider, she certainly seems strange.
Like the way she appeared here instantly when she was confronting Saber, and the chill she's releasing... Her pressure is much stronger now.

"R-Rider...!? What are you thinking? Don't do selfish things when you can't even beat Emiya's Servant...!"

"Yes, I certainly cannot match Saber.
But please be rest assured. My Noble Phantasm exceeds those of other Servants. No matter who the opponent is, they will not be able to stop my charge."

Rider raises her dagger.
"What?"
Everyone here lets out a voice of surprise.
For some reason, Rider takes her dagger to her neck and
Slashes it in one breath.

...Fresh blood splatters around.
Blood gushes out from the neck of the black-garbed Rider.

"W-What are you..."
Even her Master, Shinji, is surprised at her actions.
Even if Servants are beyond human, that wound is fatal.
Rider will lose large amounts of blood and will just disappear.

"...!?"
But that's just a needless worry for people who know nothing.
The splattered blood stops in the air and slowly forms a circle.

It's a magic circle drawn in blood.
A pattern I've never seen before.
A creature-like figure that looks creepy.
...A big lump of magical energy, created by Rider.
The boundary field Rider was supporting until now seems small compared to this.

"What...!? M-My body's being pushed back"
The huge amount of magical energy must be leaking.
My body is pushed back as if blown by a strong wind.

"Shirou, please get away...! Rider is about to use her Noble Phantasm. You will be in the way if you stand there...!"
Saying so, Saber pulls my body away by force.
Protecting me, Saber confronts Rider's magic circle.

"Are you planning to run?
If you will involve your Master in this as well, I will just defeat you here. I will not let you use that Noble Phantasm."

"...Fufu. Of course not. It is the role of a Servant to protect its Master. I am just going to run taking my Master with me.
If you do not like that, come after us, Saber."

"Wellthat is if you still have the will to fight after seeing this."

I hear a throbbing.
With a sound like flesh wrenching open, Rider's hair whirls up and

"...!"
"Shirou, please get down...!"

Dragged by Saber, I fall to the ground.
A loud sound and a flash.
I close my eyes at the raging wind.
But even with my eyes closed, I'm forced to feel it.
Something white passes by.
I feel like something is blazing through the hallway with great speed like a giant arrow of light


When I raise my head, the scene in front of me is the remains of cruel destruction.
Shinji and Rider have disappeared.
...The light just now wasn't aimed at us, but was probably just to escape from here.

My wounds hurt.
The firing hammer that was pulled inside me is released.
The heat flowing through me quickly fades away.

"Shirou...?"
I can't hear Saber's questions anymore.
In that manner, my consciousness falls into white darkness.
...I'm having that dream.
Maybe this is the image of "death" for me.
The closer I get to death, the more the scene that I don't want to see revives in my head.

A mountain of corpses.
People crumbling away.
A time when everyone wished for help, yet none received any.
That was painful.
It was so painful that even living was painful, and I even thought I would be at ease if I just disappeared.

With faint consciousness, I reached out for no reason.
I didn't reach out seeking help.
I just thought that the sky was a long way away.
...In my last moments, that's what I thought.

And then, my mind faded away, and the raised hand fell to the ground.
...No.
It should have fallen to the ground.

A big hand grasped the falling hand.
That person came into the fire to save anybody, and found me.

...I remember that face.
A figure of a man, with tears welling in his eyes, delighted from the bottom of his heart that he has found someone alive.
It was because he looked so happy...
...I even thought that he was the one that was saved, not me.

So.
Looking enviable even in my dying eyes, the man saved an unfamiliar child as if thanking something.

That was the turning point.
My weakness accepting death turned into the strength of a desire to live.
The mind that could not think of anything was filled with joy of being saved.
I moved my fingers with all my might, so as not to let go of the man's hand, and lost consciousness.

After that, I was in a hospital when I came to, and I received a visit from the man who saved me.

That was ten years ago.
Since then, Emiya Shirou just chased after Kiritsugu.
I could only think of becoming like him.
Not because I was saved.
It's just because I could not forget his face at that time, and I tried to acquire that illusion.
I ran, aiming to be like that.
Somewhere in my mind, I didn't want to realize.

That's rightthat one day...
Hoping about how much I would be saved if I could smile the way Kiritsugu did back then


...When I open my eyes, I am in my familiar living room.
The sound of the clock is awfully loud.
I seem to be sleeping on the floor and when I raise my arms, both of them are wrapped up in bandages.

"It's dark outside."
I push myself up.
The clock says it's already past 10PM.

"It's not 'it's dark outside', you ingrate. Isn't there something you should say when you wake up?"
"Tohsaka, I didn't know you were here."

"Don't say something like that.
I was by your side nursing you all this time, and that's your attitude?"
...I see.
I've done something bad.

"Sorry. My head's still not working. I can't think straight, but... thanks. I owe you one again, Tohsaka."

"! W-Well, it's fine since it's nothing important. You had such a bad wound, so I'm sure it's only natural for your mind to be hazy.

"...So, does it hurt anywhere? It seems the external wounds have already healed, but I can't tell about your insides. We have to heal the wounds if there's anything wrong, right?"

"No. I just feel dull, it doesn't hurt anywhere.
But"

I feel like I'm floating in the air.
I don't know how I came to be here.
I can't even remember what I was doing toda

"! Tohsaka, how's the school!? What happened to me after that...!?"

"It's all right, you don't have to worry about them. Kirei went to follow-up on the school.
He'll handle the repairs on the hallway and take care of the aftermath, so you don't have to think about it. He's a priest, so he'll get divine punishment if he doesn't at least do that."

"Him? Then, the school's..."
"It didn't end up as a serious matter. Many students were taken to the hospital, but none of their lives is in danger. Everyone's being treated for malnutrition, and they only have to stay there for a few days."

"I see, that's..."
Great.
The boundary field was stopped late, but that didn't mean I was too late.

As soon as I relax, strength escapes my body.
I take a deep breath and lean against the wall.

"...Then did Kotomine heal my body too?
Even you can't heal such wounds, right?"

"What are you saying? You healed them yourself.
It's just like with Berserker. Your ability to close your wounds is excessive... but you don't know anything about it, right?"

"Of course not. I don't understand at all either. I had a normal body until I made the contract with Saber."

"...Hmm. Maybe you just don't know, but could it be that one of your ancestors is a lizard?"
"...Hey now. Don't make such scary jokes with a straight face. This feels weird for me too. It's kind of like my body isn't my body."

"I guess it's fine. Whatever the reason, you've survived because of it.
You've been saved twice already, so I guess turning into a lizard is an acceptable bargain."
"...Tohsaka. Do you enjoy making fun of a seriously injured person?"

"You mean someone who used to be seriously injured, right?
Well, anyway, thank Saber. I don't know the reasoning behind it, but it's because of Saber that your body's like this."

"Oh."
That energizes my beaten-up mind.
The thing I have to do now.
There are words I need to say to her, asking for her help and being saved by her.

"Guh"
I get up quickly.
Moving causes pain throughout my body, but I can't worry about that.

"Tohsaka, where's Saber?"
"She's in the dojo. I'm going to my room to get some stuff."
Tohsaka heads over to the outbuilding with light steps.

"Ouch..."
My joints cry out in pain.
I bear it by gritting my teeth and hurry to the dojo.

I arrive at the dojo.
Saber is sitting Japanese-style by herself, as if meditating.

"Shirou...!? Are you awake!?"
Saber notices me coming in, stands up, and comes to me instantly.

"Sorry. I just woke up. So, Saber..."

"It is not 'sorry'! I have many things I need to say to you...! You accepted a call from the enemy without me, you tried to fight by yourself, and you did not take care of your body...!

"Do you understand that all of those actions were foolish actions that would have been fatal!? No, you really were almost dead. What enjoyment are you getting out of causing me so much trouble...!?"

"Uhwell, um..."
"What is it!? I will not back down because of lame excuses.
I will totally hear you out today!"

Saber flares up at me.
It's certainly an intense pressure, but seeing Saber being so emotional is rather pleasant.

"...I know. I'll tell you.
So let's talk, Saber. My body is fine, as it appears."

"Eh... Shirou, you are healed?"
"Yeah, I guess so. I'm alive for now."
"I seethat is good."

Where did that threatening attitude go?
Saber takes a relieved breath and smiles softly as if congratulating me on my safety.


...That really makes me realize... I made her feel so uneasy that even the expressionless Saber made such a face.
I wasn't relying on Saber.
But still, she accepted me as the person to fight with.

"!"
...I was the stupid one.
I didn't notice such pure trust.
And I could not even give her the simple trust of letting her fight.

"Saber."
I speak naturally.
I can stare directly at the person I was so embarrassed to look at until now.

"...Yes? What is it, Shirou?"
"I'm sorry. I was being stupid."
I bow my head.

"What... Shirou, please do not do such a thing. My previous expression was just a figure of speech. I was certainly angry, but there is no such need for you to apologize to me"
"There is. It's natural to apologize to you, as my partner.
I'm sorry I let you worry. As long as I'm with you, I will never fight alone."

"Shirou, that..."
"Yeah. Saber, please lend me your strength.
I can't beat the other Masters by myself. I need your help."

"...Then you will admit that your actions until now were a mistake? That it is my role to fight, and that you will devote yourself as backup as a Master?"


...No, that's wrong.
I am not mistaken in that regard.
I still don't want to see Saber hurt.
That's why I have forbidden her from fighting.
...That was the only thing I had wrong.
If I decided to fight with her, I should just have protected her with all my might

"...No. I don't think I was mistaken.
If you are going to protect me, I'll protect you too. I can't let you fight alone."

...Saber doesn't respond.
Cold air flows through the dojo.


...But this is one thing that I cannot give up.
I raise my head, thinking that I'll just need to beg her until she accepts it.

And then...
"...Sigh. That obstinate personality is just like you."
"Huh...? Um, Saber?"

"Honestly, there is no need to answer now.
I am your sword. Who else but me will be your help, Shirou?"
Saying that, Saber puts out her left hand.


With no sensible words coming to mind, I silently shake her hand.
...A certain feeling of a handshake.
A few days after we met, we finally exchange a real contract.

"...? Why are you two shaking hands?"
Hey.
Why do you have to show up with such timing...!?

"!"
We release our hands quickly.
"...? You guys are acting weird. Could it be that you two were having a secret conference?"

"No, that is not true. I was merely taking his pulse to check if Master's body was okay."

I'm dumbfounded.
Saber is offering a really suspicious lie.
...No, before that, why is Saber panicking too?

"Oh. You sure take his pulse in a strange way."
Tohsaka looks at Saber curiously.
Perhaps because she's not accustomed to lying, Saber starts to act even more suspiciously.
...I have to help her or we might end up in an even worse situation.

"Hey, what do you want? Didn't you say you were going to your room to get something?"
"Oh, yeah. Here Saber, this is it."
"Thank you. I am sorry for the trouble, Rin."

Tohsaka gives Saber a bag.
...Saber takes it with a happy expression.

"That's the last set, so be careful. Even if it was an enforced summoning, your clothes will scatter if you arm yourself by force."
"I am sorry. It was so sudden, I did not think that far ahead. But I am glad you had the same clothes."

"Yeah. It's a simple design like a uniform.
That Kirei, forcing me to wear these plain clothes. ...Well, it's fine since those clothes don't look good on me. Why are you so concerned with them anyway, Saber?"

"Shirou said they look good on me."

...Okay.
I don't understand the situation too well, but it seems that's the third set of clothes for Saber.
We don't have any women's clothes here, so that means Saber is borrowing clothes from Tohsaka.

"......"
But, um...
I'd prefer it if you two did your girl talk elsewhere.
I'm a guy too.
We were having a serious conversation, but if you talk about this sort of thing, I can't help but feel let down

Nothing much happens after that and Saber and Tohsaka force me to sleep.

Even though I regained consciousness, my body is still badly injured.
My arms were cut up by Rider so badly that I would normally have had to cut them off at my elbows, and my body is filled with cracks and strains from falling from the third floor.
I guess they share the opinion that I should sleep and rest for now, even though there are lots of things to think about.

"......"
But I have to settle things as quickly as possible with Shinji.
Shinji activated that boundary field without hesitation.
Even I know how dangerous it is to let such a Master roam freely.

"...Dammit... This is no... time... to... be... sleeping..."
Emptiness like dizziness.
...Only my mind is back to normal.
As soon as I lay down, my body demands sleep as it's still not fully healed.

"...Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll"
...I can't rest like this.
Even if my body isn't fully healed, I have to go and find Shinji
...I'm dreaming.
It must be because my blood is hot and my body is pulsing.
I am reliving the scene I don't need to remember.

It's my oldest memory.
At the same time, it is a memory that can't be separated from me.
A scene from ten years ago that never goes away, even though I usually never recall it.
It's not that I forgot it.
It's not that I want to forget it.
For me, it is just something that has already happened.

So it's not something I feel pain over.
It's not something I feel particularly angry about.

What's past is past.
I cannot redo it, nor go back to it.
I have escaped from that scene and still continue to live.
All I can do is look forward.

...No one told me to.
I just vaguely thought like this ever since I was a child.
Not forgetting or denying the past.
The only way to make use of what has gone away is to acknowledge it

"Ahuh."
I wake up because of the burning heat in my body.
...How long was I asleep?
I guess I fell asleep while feeling the night wind, without returning to my room.

In the dim shed, there's me and

"...! Saber...!?"
"You have awakened, Shirou. I do not mind you escaping out of your room, but it is slovenly for you to sleep here."
There is Saber's figure, looking like she wants to complain to me.

"Oh, morning. Well, I was hot last night and went outside, so I guess I fell asleep then."

"I can tell. Please do not worry about excuses, but take more care next time. My position will be in question if my Master sleeps in a place like this."

"Ugh... sorry, I'll try to sleep in my room as much as possible from now on."
"If you understand, I am glad.
By the way, Shirou. Taiga has been calling for you."

"Fuji-Nee is? What would she want me for?"
"It must be about breakfast. It is already past time for breakfast."
"Ehwhoa, it's already past seven...!? Damn, I overslept...!"

"It seems so. It is unusual for you to wake up last. Rin's training last night must have tired you quite a lot."
Saber analyzes the situation calmly.
But I don't have that much composure.

"Sorry for making you wake me up, but could you go back first? I'll change and head to the kitchen too."
"Yes. Then I shall try to calm Taiga down as much as possible."

Saber leaves with calm footsteps.
But, calm down Fuji-Nee...? Saber has already adapted quite well to the mornings at our house.

I run into the kitchen.
Ignoring Fuji-Nee's vilification, I prepare breakfast in about five minutes.

"Sorry to keep you waiting. There isn't much time till school starts, so eat quickly."
I put the breakfast onto the table.
"Wha"
And then.

"What is this!!?"
Fuji-Nee explodes.

"What is this!? There's only toast! Shirou, why is this the only thing for breakfast...!?"

"...Hey now, I slept in, so it can't be helped. There's no time to make anything else. Anyways, a meal with bread is basically just this. We're just missing salad and egg, so there's not much difference."

"Of course there's a difference!
Don't the rest of you think so too!?"
Fuji-Nee asks Tohsaka and Saber, who are eating silently.
But she shouldn't be so optimistic.
Those two aren't as greedy as Fuji-Nee is. They won't agree with her.

"...You're right. I'm not Fujimura-Sensei, but I cannot forgive such laziness. I can only consider this an insult to the bread."
...Hey, hold on.
I thought you don't usually eat breakfast!

".........Sigh."
Whoa, what was that sigh that sounded like obvious disappointment!? Did your character change, Saber!?

"See, everyone agrees Shirou is the one at fault. It's decided by majority rule, so go and make a proper breakfast when you've repented your actions."
"I can't follow such an unfair match! First of all, you'll be late if I make something now. It's already seven thirty. You won't make it in time unless you run while eating, so I suggest you give up on that idea!"

"It's fine. If I have to choose between being late and being hungry, I'll choose breakfast."
"Don't do that! What teacher in the world would do that...!? It's fine, so eat and go to school quickly. I'll tell you this, but I won't be cooking any breakfast other than this."

"Hmmm. Geez, you're diligent in the weirdest places. If you keep talking like an old man, you'll become really old quickly."

"You don't need to tell me. I already have the tastes of an old man because of you, Fuji-Nee."
So saying, I start eating my toast.
...Well, it's true.
There is something desolate about having only toast for breakfast when there's this many people.
Good evening! This is the hint corner that supports all of you who want to die instantly, the Tiger Dojo!
I'm the senior student, Ilya!
The main storyline is almost up to the middle stage. Onee-chan is happy that Shirou is willing to fight.
But this choice is troublesome. Were you really listening to Saber-chan's advice?
Of course not! Saber and Rin's explanations are too long. I found it too annoying, so I skipped the entire training scene.
You stupid student.
Ouch... I-I'm sorry. It's just a small lie.
Geez. Look, unless you're in a lot of danger, avoid fighting a Servant head on.
There'll be a chance if you keep holding on. You should be patient for now, and let your opponent do as they wish.
Osu, I understand.
By the way, you push a stamp of something every time we come to this dojo. What is it?
That's called a Tiger Stamp. If you collect them, you'll feel good, and they're also a good way to see how much of the game you've completed already.
And if you collect them all...
And?
Your screen will be filled with paws!
Scary!
Kyaa! Perfect world!
So I can't be held responsible even if you go through lots of trouble to collect them.
So I'll be waiting at the next Tiger Dojo!
We'll be waiting!
Stop, Tiger! You ate the Fleur cake I hid in the fridge, right!?
Heh, it's your fault for keeping it!
Don't you know what expiration date means!?
Who cares! Just give me back my cake, you big tiger!
Fuhahaha, I cannot give back something I've already digested.
Actually Ilya-chan, that dissection-like red cake with tons of raspberries on it is bad taste.
Is that really Fleur cake?
Yeah. Its name is Rafflesia Umbrella.
It's a monstrous and deadly new product that uses the world's biggest flower, Rafflesia, as its motif.
I hear that to get the rotten smell, they use real Rafflesia flower instead of a rose.
Guh, no wonder the texture felt like steak.
...Fleur's management has reached its limit. It's in its closing years if a sweet store starts to make new products.
What? That cake wasn't good? It looked really red and pretty.
Uhh... Ilya-chan, we have to do something about your aesthetic sense first.
Well, the talk about cakes ends now!
We're starting Tiger Dojo, the corner that saves you people who yield to irrational choices!
Osu, all preparations are ready, master!
Yes. Then the state of your death this time is...
Oh, you died from falling. Even though you have this mysterious healing power, you'll die if you fall from the third floor.
Heehee. Incidentally, you would normally die from Rider's roundhouse kick going through your stomach.
Hmm... it really is Die Hard.
It's not strange for Shirou to be killed at any time, so if something like "use the Command Spell" appears as a choice, you should use it without hesitation.
So go back to the previous choice and redo the scene!
Summon Saber-chan quickly and beat that sexy battle Onee-chan!
(Sexy...!?)







"......"
I shouldn't even need to think twice about it.
I'm a novice, and Tohsaka is at her full potential as a Master and a magus.
Considering the events yesterday, it'd be smarter to join up with Tohsaka.


......I touch my stomach, the place I got cut.
It's wrapped in bandages, and touching it sends waves of pain and nausea through me.

...It's only natural.
I wasn't just cut, I was almost split in half.
Thanks to Tohsaka and Saber, I'm still alive. But as long as Berserker is after me, I'm a dead man.

"......"
But something still lingers in the back of my mind.

The black giant called Berserker.
The girl in white, accompanied by the strongest Servant.
The innocent, whimsical, and cruel girl, Ilyasviel.
Ilyasviel von Einzbern.
That's the name Shinji's grandfather said.

"Emiya-kun. I want to hear your response."
"OhI'm sorry. I was thinking about that Ilya girl.
 Joining up with you means we'll be fighting her, right?"

"Yes. She's ready to fight, so we just need to retaliate.
 We need to defeat all the Masters anyway. If she wants to kill us, we should do likewise."

"......"
Tohsaka's mind is made up.
In Tohsaka's mind, that girl is just an enemy that must be defeated.
But
I know there's something wrong with me for thinking this way, but I don't want to fight her.

"Emiya-kun? I hope this isn't the case, but don't tell me her looks are deceiving you."
She glares at me.


She's sharp.
I didn't realize it, but my hesitation seems proof that I was being deceived.

...She is Berserker's Master.
If she has such a strong Servant, she must be a powerful magus. I shouldn't focus too much on her outward appearance.
I shouldn't, but

"I'm sorry, Tohsaka.
 I'm glad you're worried about me, but I can't give you the response you want. This is a serious matter, you know? I feel I shouldn't rush to a decision."
I look directly back at her and answer.
Tohsaka narrows her eyes a bit and nods emotionlessly.

"Then negotiations have failed. ...Well, you have a point too. If you really want to win, you can't trust anyone."
"That's not it. I trust you, Tohsaka. It's just that I can't decide on my own. If I'm Saber's Master, I can't make a promise without her consent."

"I see. That is true. You are a Master now."

Giving a nod of understanding, Tohsaka turns away.
She strides to the door, her hair fluttering behind her.

But just before leaving, the girl who could have been my ally gives me one last look, and...
"Goodbye. We will be enemies the next time we meet."
...Like the girl Ilya, she leaves a cold warning.
"Master. I have simplified things, but that is all the explanation I can give you."
"Okay. It was quick, but I get it now. Sorry, Saber."

"...You should not be 'sorry'.
 If you understand the situation, you should be deciding on a plan of action."
She leans forward expectantly.

...I see.
Saber is the same type as Tohsaka: attack first.
That's good in its own way, but I can't decide what to do when I don't know what we should be doing.

"Hmm... We should wait and see... but we can't afford to do that. I don't know anything about the other Masters and I'm curious about the Ilya girl. ...We should be going out in search of other Masters, but"

I think it's dangerous to wander around aimlessly.
...Damn.
Maybe I should have cooperated with Tohsaka.

"Ilya...? What about Berserker's Master, Shirou?"

"Huh...? Oh, no. I'm just wondering why she's after us.
 And that wasn't the first time I met her. I've met her once before, and I've heard the name Einzbern before as well."

"......"
Then.
After hearing the name "Einzbern," Saber gives me a hard look.

"Saber? Do you also know the name Einzbern?"
"...Yes, I do. Let me ask you instead. Do you not know of that name?"

"Well, I've only heard of it. An unrelated guy asked me how the Einzbern girl was doing before I even met her."
"......I see. Then you have not heard anything."
Saber closes her eyes and ponders.

"...This must be fate. You should go to the church if you would like to know about the Einzbern family.
 That priest should be able to answer your questions and guide you to the path you must take."

"The church...? You mean the church we went to yesterday? But he told us we shouldn't go back there unless I want to revoke my Command Spell."

"He must have said that for expediency's sake. That rule is only part of the face he puts up for his association. It has no power if you are not part of their association."
"Hm..."

...That is certainly true.
Tohsaka belongs to the Magic Association, but we don't.
We wouldn't gain anything from following their orders, so we can ignore them.

"Do you understand? That place may be a last resort for you, but are under no obligation to follow their orders."
"You're right. But I still want to avoid that place... And I don't think I should go see that priest too much."

Kotomine Kirei.
That priest feels strange.
It's not that I feel enmity or danger.
...I must not see that man.
I'm scared because I might crumble in front of him.

"I understand how you feel. I do not want to have business with him if I could help it."
She declares this with a straight face.
"...?"
That's unexpected.
I never thought heroic spirits would have difficulty dealing with human beings, and most of all

"I know I don't like him, but why don't you?
 You haven't even met him, right?"

Saber hesitates.
After frowning, she lifts up her face as if to shake off her hesitation.

"He took part in the last Holy Grail War.
 I do not know which Servant he had, but Kiritsugu always took him seriously."

"Huh?"
I know that.
I know that, but what did she just say?
"Saber... Why do you know my father's name?"

"I was Kiritsugu's Servant.
 Emiya Kiritsugu was a Master in the last Holy Grail War. He cooperated all the way through to the final fight.
 During the war, Emiya Kiritsugu saw the priest as his greatest enemy. He believed the priest was the only one who could defeat us."


Hold on.
Then what?
My father was a Master in the last Holy Grail War, fought along with Saber, and
He's part of the cause of that disaster?

"You're lying. That can't be true. Then why didn't Kotomine tell me? Why didn't my father tell me about it?"

"I do not know. I could never understand what Kiritsugu was thinking.
 But I am sure the priest did not tell you because you did not ask him. He is a man who will answer you if you ask. He will tell you the truth if you inquire him about it."


Saber stares at me silently.
The meaning of being a Master.
Her green eyes tell me to go to the church of my own will if I want to know about Emiya Kiritsugu.

"......"
I head to the church.
Saber must plan to watch over me, since she's following me in that outfit.

"......"
I look up at the church.
...Even though Saber urged me to come here, I'm still not prepared.
I don't feel like going in there to ask the priest about what happened ten years ago.

"Master."
I turn back to the girl behind me.
"I shall wait here. Please face the priest yourself."

"...I know. I came this far, so I won't back down now."
"Please do not tell the priest that I was summoned.
 You should not tell him that the same heroic spirit was summoned twice."

"Okay. I'll ask him only about Kiritsugu. I'll be back quickly, so wait for me here."
"...Very well. Please be careful, Shirou. Call for me if danger approaches. That priest makes me uneasy. I do not know what will happen to you if you let your guard down."

"I feel the same way. Don't worry. I'll escape and call for you if anything happens."
I take a step onto the stairs.
I enter the church, leaving Saber under the winter sky.

I don't see the priest in the chapel.
In his place, I see a man sitting in a chair.
His hair is golden.
He must be a foreigner.

"Excuse me. Is Father Kotomine here?"
I ask him, not expecting a response.


The man slowly gets up.
At that instant...
All my muscles stiffen up.

He walks to me.
There's something odd about that simple action.
He is walking towards me in a casual manner.
That's all he's doing, sowhy am I getting ready to be killed by this man?

"Oh"
The man raises his arm.
It reaches out for my neck and
...Stops midair.

"Hm. You are entranced by something unpleasant."

He withdraws.
Yes, that is only natural.
I'm actually the strange one for thinking he was going to kill me just because he was coming closer.

"Wait right there. You have business with Kotomine, right?"
He disappears behind the altar.

"......"
Several minutes pass.
"I am surprised. Have you retired after only half a day, Emiya Shirou?"
Kotomine appears, greeting me with that annoying tone I remember from last night.

"That's not it. I came here because I have something I want to ask you. I wouldn't come here for any other reason."
"Very well. I am a busy man, so I do not want people to be attached to me."

Kotomine draws closer, his firm footsteps filling the air.
...Is this what you would call invisible pressure?
He has a severe air about him that makes people conscious of their weakness.
It must be a good characteristic for priests, but could it also be their greatest fault?

"What is it? Go ahead and ask if you have a question.  There is no need for greetings between us."


...He's right.
There's no need to be friends with him.
I came here to confirm what Saber told me.
I should ask him and quickly leave.

"There's only one thing I need to ask you. Why didn't you tell me about it?"
"Hmm. What did I not tell you?"
"It's about my father. Why didn't you tell me that Emiya Kiritsugu was a Master in the previous Holy Grail War?"
He smiles.
He does not look guilty. ...This man is enjoying the fact that Kiritsugu's name came out of my mouth.

"Answer me. It's natural for you to know if you're the supervisor of the Holy Grail War. So why didn't you tell me about it?"

"Is it not obvious? What good would it do to you to know that your father was a Master? Emiya Kiritsugu's achievements have nothing to do with you."

His disinterested tone shows no opening for a rebuttal.
Kotomine's answer isn't wrong.
Even if my father was a great Master, it doesn't mean I get any benefit out of it.
But

"...No, there is a connection. Did I become a Master because I'm Kiritsugu's son?"
I was raised as his son, and I studied magic as his apprentice.
I became a Master just like him, and made a contract with the exact same heroic spirit. There has to be a meaning behind all this.

"You said I became a Master by chance.
 I would've chosen to fight then and there if you'd told me that Kiritsugu was a Master. Why didn't you tell me about it?"

"That is none of my concern.
 I have never heard of a Master's title being hereditary, and in any case, you are not Kiritsugu's son.
 It is rare for an unprepared person to be chosen as a Master."

"The Command Spell is usually not given to someone who knows nothing of the Holy Grail. I do not know why you were chosen as an exception."

"...Then I really don't have a connection with my father?
 I was chosen to be a Master by chance, and my father saved me because..."
...He saved me out of pure good will?

"As far as I know. But I cannot understand the intentions of the Holy Grail. I would like to say that you were chosen to be a Master by chance, but I suspect fate had a hand in this.
 The Grail might want you to atone for Emiya Kiritsugu's sin of denying its power."

"What...? My father denied the Holy Grail?"
"That is right. Your father came to this town to obtain it.
 His sole purpose was to obtain the Holy Grail. The Holy Grail answered his pure wish, and maybe the Holy Grail thought he would be a fit owner."

"But Emiya Kiritsugu betrayed the Holy Grail.
 He destroyed the Holy Grail at the very end. To end the Holy Grail War, he betrayed the Holy Grail which placed expectations on him and its longstanding desire."

"He destroyedthe Holy Grail...?"
If that's true, the Holy Grail certainly would not approve of Emiya Kiritsugu.

But he wasn't mistaken.
A Holy Grail that grants any wish.
Magi kill each other to obtain it.
...The Holy Grail is the cause of the conflict.
My father did not betray anyone when he destroyed the Holy Grail.
He ended the Holy Grail War as the superhero I always admired.

"...He didn't betray anyone. Kiritsugu destroyed the Holy Grail probably because he thought there was no need for it. Kiritsugu did not betray anything."

"Hm. It seems you do not know what Kiritsugu was like before.
 All right. There is little point to it, but I shall tell you the true identity of Emiya Kiritsugu."
The priest smiles.
It is the ominous smile of someone intoxicated with delight.

"Emiya Kiritsugu.
 He was a magus unrelated to the Holy Grail War. He lived for his desires and objectives, and sought the Holy Grail as a result.
 A miracle he could not make come true himself.
 An ideal he could not implement with mere human power.
 He could not cast away his immature dream that should have been given up, and that is why he sought the Holy Grail to make his wish come true."

"I do not know where he heard about the Holy Grail War.
 It might have been that someone else deemed him worthy. But I do not care how it happened."

"Either way, Emiya Kiritsugu was hired as a Master.
 He was named the greatest Master by the Einzbernsthe family of magi that is the cause of this ritual."

"Having learned from the previous three wars, the Einzbern family sought a Master specialized in battle.
 The magic of the Einzbern family is not suited for battle. Therefore, they put their trust in Kiritsugu, a strong magus who did not belong to the Magic Association."

"They taught Kiritsugu about the Holy Grail, gave him power as a Master, and gave him a woman to produce a successor who would be more suited to combat.
 He would be formally accepted into the Einzbern family if he obtained the Holy Grail. It was like accepting a commoner into a noble family.
 The Einzberns treated Kiritsugu exceptionally, and it is easy to imagine how much trust they had in Kiritsugu."

"And Kiritsugu answered their trust.
 Kiritsugu defeated many Masters in the previous Holy Grail War. I am the only one who survived after fighting him. Everyone else was killed for sure.
 He was precise, careful, brutal, and cruel. He showed no pity for his enemies. Once the decision was made, he killed. He killed a Servant, let the Master beg for help while crawling on the floor, and ruthlessly shot him in the head. He showed no emotion even after killing. Neither the supremacy of his strength nor guilt in killing the weak."

"In short, he was a machine.
 He did not have any emotions to begin with. There was no space for his human emotions to enter."

"Whatmy father was a machine...?"
"Yes, he killed.
 He did not think like you about not involving innocent people. He thoroughly attacked his enemy's weakness, allowing no chance to counterattack. He used the enemy's family as a shield and their friends as their shackles to win the war."

"Yes. If Kiritsugu were in this war, he would be the Master you would hate the most. If being heartless is evil, he would be the greatest evil of all."


"What? Are you not satisfied?
 I understand. Emiya Kiritsugu is not a machine.
 He threw away his personal feelings for his goals. It was both his strength and weakness to cast off his emotions through his own will without even using self-suggestion.
 It would have been easy to prepare another 'cold-hearted' personality in him, but he must have believed such a person would not obtain the Holy Grail."

"He went so far, butthat same weakness made him betray everything.
 The Einzberns entrusted their longstanding desire to Kiritsugu.
 The Holy Grail appeared after five Masters were defeated.
 It was a wish that no human could make come true, a wish Emiya Kiritsugu desired."

"But he threw everything away at the last moment.
 That is the end of the last Holy Grail Warthe true nature of the magus you call your father."

"The Holy Grail disappeared and the Holy Grail War ended.
 The Einzberns retreated after being betrayed by Kiritsugu, and they spent ten years preparing the next Holy Grail."

"...Hm. Now that I think about it, they must have seen this Holy Grail War coming.
 The previous war ended without any result.
 Unused magical energy carries over to the next war. They must have known the next war would begin shortly."

"......"
I can't accept Kotomine's story.
That Kiritsugu was a cold-hearted Master...
And that a noble family of magi had a connection to my father...

There's no way I can accept it all when it all comes so suddenly.
...All I can tell from this is that Kotomine did not lie, and

"Kotomine. Did you hate Kiritsugu?"
The man before me, the one who is uninterested in everything, actually displays anger towards Kiritsugu.

"Of course. We were at the opposite ends of the spectrum. We are natural enemies. Makiri and Einzbern considered us as the same kind, but we treated each other as natural enemies."

"...Natural enemies? You were on guard against my father like he was on guard against you?"
"No. We simply could not ignore each other."

"He was a saint beyond help.
 He could not forgive death, yet he killed to save other people. If one sacrifice were needed to save ten, he would kill the sacrifice himself without a second thought."

"He always prepared the minimum sacrifice to make his dream world where everyone could smile.
 That contradiction.
 A contradictory ideal is something I have as well, but we were not of the same kind."

"He lived for his ideal. He pursued his ideal until the moment he destroyed the Holy Grail.
 That is why he had pride in himself, allowing him to become a machine without hesitation."

"That is our similarity and our difference.
 He had an iron mind unplagued by inner conflict.
 The reason he was never woundedwas he was wounded from the start.
 He was an artificial brute, just as I was an artificial priest."

"......"
'He was wounded from the start'.
So that means the premise he believed in was wrong from the start.

"...Then are you saying you're different? You take wounds, and you're not already wounded. You're a normal human being that can be wounded if you get slashed at, right? Are you saying you're different from Kiritsugu because you're a priest...?"

"Hm. People would not consider us to be the same if that were the case.
 People thought we were similar in another aspect.
 ...Let's see. If you talk about being similar, you are more similar to him than I."

"You both have child-like ideals.
 Believing in simplicity and shouldering the role of a criminal for the sake of that ideal.
 Turning yourselves into the greatest evil to eliminate all the small evils in this world.
 You and Kiritsugu act like the saviors we call 'anti-heroes.'"

"......? What is this anti-hero thing?"
"It is what it sounds like. It is the opposite of a hero, an unforgivable murderer."
"Hey, that's just a villain. Are you making fun of me?"

"Oh my. It seems you are misunderstanding me. I am welcoming you. You are Kiritsugu's son. Think about having your enemy's son come to you for help. It is such a complex feeling that you cannot decide whether to be happy or sad."

The priest laughs silently.
...I don't know his true intentions, but he doesn't seem to be bored.

"Well, about the anti-hero.
 They are beings whose existence itself is evil, but their actions are good deeds according to people. They are beings who people set up as saviors, even if they don't want to be."

"Those are the heroic spirits called the anti-heroes. An example of this would be a sacrifice."

"Even if the sacrificed one is evil, he would become a hero if everyone in the village is saved because of the sacrifice, right?
 It would not matter to anyone whether the sacrifice was eaten or buried.
 If the one whom this disgrace was forced upon saves people, he would become a hero instead of a sinner."

"...... Is this like getting a high promotion for dying in combat?"

"No, you are wrong.
 The important part is the minds of the people who set up the hero.
 A proper hero is created from respect, gratitude, and feelings of guilt. You cannot become an anti-hero from gratitude or guilt.
 ...Well, humans forget their ugliness and substitute farce with tragedy. Heroes who died as evil will be treated as victims as time goes on, and they will not stay as pure evil."

"...Will not stay as pure evil...?"
"Correct. Anti-heroes have to be both victim and assailant.
 ...They are created by the people, but are not a part of humanity. It is that contradiction which allows them to be 'the enemy of the world' exempt from all the restraining forces of the world."

"...But then, there aren't many pure anti-heroes.
 They are something that does not exist. They are merely what people wish to exist."

"They are an ideal that humans have created, sacrifices to deny the original sin.
 Just think of the anti-hero as one of the wishes that will never come true; a synonym for peace."
"......?"

"...Hah. In short, it is a naive dream that will never come true.
 You want to be a superhero like Kiritsugu, right?
 Then you will be a great anti-hero. How about it? Why don't you wish to become a hero when you obtain the Holy Grail?"

"...Hey now.
 A superhero isn't like a hero. I don't know what you're trying to say, but I won't fall for your cheap tricks."

"Oh?  How is it different?"
"I-I don't know! It's just different, okay!? And a hero is not something you try to be, but something you are at the end. I bet the only thing the Holy Grail can give me is powers beyond my position."

"I see. So you truly are a son of his, even if not blood-related. You both are hard-headed."
He must be making fun of me, as his smile is friendly.

"Hm......"
...This guy hates my father.
But he doesn't anger me because...
...Well...
He has yet to say anything bad about my father.

"Hey. Wouldn't you have gotten along with my father?"
I ask him when I realize this.

"Oh. Why do you think so?"
"...For no reason. I just thought so."

"Then you are mistaken. I hate Emiya Kiritsugu.  We never even spoke. The one time we met, we tried to kill each other.
 I have already told you that we are exact opposites.
 Our wishes, our questions, are different. A question by the one who does not have it shall not be answered by the one who does."
His eyes tell me that is why they would never have been able to get along.

"......? 'The one who does not have it'? Are you saying Kiritsugu had something that you didn't have?"

"Yes. I could not change my will itself for something I believed in. Well, we cannot be compared since our goals were different."

"...?"
Changing your will for something you believe in...
Is that like saving ten by killing one, like he said earlier?

"You do not need to understand. Emiya Kiritsugu desired peace. Isn't it simple? But it was too simple for this complex world. He had to reject the extra parts that could not fit into that perfect shape."

"But he could not tolerate that.
 He sought a perfect shape, but still wanted to save the extra parts.
 ...But that is a miracle exceeding human power.
 There is no such thing as a world without conflict. He sought the Holy Grail to deny that fact."

"He sought his ideal, and after being faced with the fact that it was impossible, had no other choice but to rely on the Holy Grail.
 That is the end of the man who was cornered by his own ideal.
 His dream was an impossible sorcery that could only be granted by 'something that does not exist' like the Holy Grail."


A world without conflict.
Did my father really believe in such a thing?
He worked hard to become strong, but the more he matured, the more he was cornered by reality. But still, he still kept believing in his ideal and in the end, attained the miracle-granting Holy Grail.

Emiya Kiritsugu must have experienced many failures by that time.
First of all, to seek the Holy Grail means knowing your wish is unattainable by normal means.

He wore out and strayed far away from his ideal.
But my father still sought the Holy Grail.
For his ideal, and for everything he sacrificed.

"...But my father destroyed the Holy Grail. His wish was never granted, right?"

"Correct. It was his own self that betrayed him in the end.
 ...In that instant, I began to feel anger towards him.
 To be honest, I did not mind his wish. I was interested in the 'peace' that humans wish for."

"Isn't that the same for you as well? You're a priest after all, right?"
The priest nods, saying that a world without conflict is what everyone desires.

"But that is not my wish. First of all, I do not have such ordinary wishes."
"You don't have ordinary wishes...?"

"That's right. An ideal world is one that is the most comfortable. For Emiya Kiritsugu, it was a world without conflict. From the very beginning, his standard was different from mine."

"...?"
"It is a simple story. There is nothing that brings me happiness. It does not matter, let it be believing in people or having people believe in me. What other people called happiness did not bring me any joy."

He says this emotionlessly.
He is not talking to me. It's almost like a monologue.

"Well, that is all.
 I answered your question if Emiya Kiritsugu was a Master well enough."
"Uhno, hold on. It's not just my father I want to know about. Um, well..."

About my preparation for the role of Master and about how I should go about fighting from now on...
...I bet he'll laugh and make fun of me if I asked something so stupid.
I want to avoid that.
In fact, I will avoid it.

"If you have any other questions, make it short. That took longer than I thought."

"!"
...No, there was something else I wanted to ask him about.
Didn't I come to this church because I wanted this question answered?

"Aren't you concerned about the Einzberns?
 I would think they would want to kill you, since you are Kiritsugu's son."

"...! Yeah, it's about that...! First of all, who is this Einzbern? You said they are the cause of the Holy Grail War or something."

"Yes, they are the cause. I told you that the Holy Grail War is a ritual, yes? If there is a ritual, it is natural for there to be a ritualist."

"There were some magi 200 years ago who found out there is a distortion in the ley line on this land. They offered their secret techniques to each other to create the Holy Grail's activation circle.
 That was the start of the Holy Grail War. The three families involved in its creation are the legitimate owners of the Holy Grail."

"The ones that created the Holy Grail. The ones that devised the Command Spell which abuses the heroic spirits. The ones that offered the land and the technique to bore a hole into the world."

"Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka.
 They are the three families that started it all, with lineage and history far surpassing ours. The Tohsaka are the only ones from this land, but their fatherly master is that Schweinorg. Well, if the master is the kind of person I hear he is, it is ridiculous to group them according to race."

"......Hm. So the Einzberns are the leading family of the Holy Grail War?"

"In the past, yes. But they are only participants now that the Holy Grail summoning has failed and its ownership became uncertain.
 Now, their only role is to create the vessel of the Holy Grail.
 The same goes for Tohsaka and Makiri. They are just families whose members have a higher likelihood of being chosen as  Masters."

"...But the Holy Grail is what the Einzbern family proposed in the first place. Their history spans a thousand years. A family that lasted for a thousand years without spawning any branch families is rare."

"Do you understand, Emiya Shirou? The Einzbern family has only pursued the fulfillment of the Holy Grail for a thousand years.
 A thousand years. They are crazy, continuing their deeds from the time when barbarism such as mass murder was allowed for the sake of recovering holy ground.
 They are not fanatics, not obstinate, nor crazy. They just held the hopeless cross to enforce the meaninglessness."

"That is why the Einzbern magi are beyond the domain of magic. They are monsters, never straying from their path, always attempting to achieve a common goal.  Normally such people die off after a few decades.
 We cannot imagine their feeling of disgrace and frustration when they had to invite in a magus outside of their family."

"But their desire to complete the Holy Grail was stronger still.
 They repeated their mistake for 500 years. It took them 300 years to accept the fact that they could not obtain the Holy Grail by themselves.
 Andit took them another 200 years to realize that they could not obtain it unless they use their own powers."

"The Einzberns literally killed their emotions to cooperate with Makiri and Tohsaka.
 As a result, their ownership of the Holy Grail was taken away and they were reduced to mere participants in the war. They endured the disgrace, even going as far as contaminating their own bloodline by inviting in an outside magus. But unbelievably, Emiya Kiritsugu betrayed them with the Holy Grail in front of him."

"That is the connection between Kiritsugu and the Einzberns.
 And that is your connection with them."


...I see.
Then it's natural for that girl to come after me.
It's natural for them not to let their betrayer's son go if he becomes a Master.

"Do you understand now? All the Masters have some sort of burden, but the obsession of the Makiri and Einzbern families cannot be expressed into words. If the Makiri family have carried their burden for five hundred years, the Einzbern family have carried theirs for a thousand.
 If anyone has the right to own the Holy Grail, it would be one of them."

"......"
I'm at a loss for words.
No man can stand against an obsession that has lasted for centuries.

"Do not be depressed. Emiya Kiritsugu did betray them, but you do not need to condemn him for it.
 To put it another way, he held to his belief, even if it meant opposing a 1000-year-old apparition.
 He threw away everything for that purpose.
 Isn't that something to be proud of?"


...People who accepted him...
Something he protected by opposing a thousand years of history...
I'm not buying everything the priest has told me, but if it really is true

If I am to call myself my father's son, I have to follow my beliefs like he did

"What is wrong? Are you scared now that you've heard a thousand years?"

"No. I chose to fight, no matter what the reason is. I don't care what the other Masters think. I won't let something like the disaster ten years ago happen again."
I raise my head in determination.
The priest nods, apparently satisfied.

"That is good enough. If that is your reason to fight, put your life on the line as you do so. There will be more victims the longer the war lasts. Risk your life like Kiritsugu and lure your enemies in."

"...You're saying what you want because it doesn't concern you. You're telling me to be bait?"

"You have nothing else to risk, so it cannot be helped.
 Well, it is not entirely hopeless. You have no ability to detect other Masters, but Servants can sense other Servants. If you have an excellent Servant, you need only wait."


I turn my back to him.
There's nothing else I need to ask.
I've kept Saber waiting, so I should be going back now.

"Hold on. Let me ask you something. Do you know any healing magic?"
"No. What about it?"

"Well, then bring any wounded people here.
 As part of The Church, I cannot overlook any victims. I can handle all the treatments unless they are beyond help."

I stop.

"...I'm surprised. You can use healing magic? That's banned in the Church, right?"

"It is outside of our jurisdiction, but I have acquired it.
 I once had someone die in front of me. After that, I started to study it, and it seems I am more compatible with it than I thought."

"Oh, but I will ask for compensation if I am to heal you. I have to be fair as the supervisor."
"I refuse. I wouldn't come to you for help even if my life depended on it."

I turn away, and this time I really do leave.
The lights disappear.
It's eleven o'clock. We waited until the town fell asleep before we went outside.

"Well, Shirou. Are we going to the center of town?"
"......"

......Sakura's state didn't change after dinner's cleanup.
If anything, it got worse.
She lost all her energy and was absent-minded, as if she had a fever.
And on top of that, she didn't want me to walk her home, so Fuji-Nee had to take her.

"Or are you planning to go to the other town? It seems likely that other Masters are over there."

"......"
Come to think of it, Sakura was acting strange the day before yesterday as well.
She looked downcast and seemed afraid of something.

"Shirou? Are you listening, Shirou?"
"......"
"Shirou! I am asking you what we should do tonight!"
"Huh!?"
I raise my head in surprise.
Saber is right in front of me, looking angry.

"Sorry, I was spacing out. You're asking me what we should do, right?"
"In that case, I need not repeat myself.
 There is a slight distortion of the ley-line in both towns. I am certain that the other Masters are doing something. We may be able to defeat one tonight, depending on where we go."

"So you're saying we might fight a Master all of a sudden?
 ...But what if it turns out to be that girl?
 You can't beat Berserker, right?"

"Master. I am in perfect condition right now. Even though I do not receive any magical energy supply, I will not easily lose.
 ...Well, all we can do against Ilyasviel is retreat. We do not know their Noble Phantasm, so we cannot use ours yet."


The only one Saber is cautious about of is Berserker.
She does not talk about other possibilitiessuch as when we might encounter Tohsaka.
For Saber, Tohsaka is merely an enemy she must defeat.
But to me, Masters are people we have to stop, not kill.

"Saber, let me confirm. We will stop fighting when the Masters and Servants surrender. My plan is to make them use up their Command Spells so they won't be Masters anymore.
 ...Is that okay?"

"...Understood. But Shirou, if the enemy does not accept our proposition, then..."
"...Yeah, then we'll follow the rules of the Holy Grail War. They should be ready for it if they're fighting as Masters."

We start descending the hill.
We can patrol this town or Shinto.
Tonight, we will
"We'll search this town tonight. The town feels strange recently, so let's investigate here before something happens."
"I feel the same way. There are no obvious abnormalities, but I am sure we will find some clues if we search thoroughly."

...Yeah, we'll look around the residential district over here first.
We'll go down to the intersection after that and patrol the other side of town.
If we can't find anything wrong, we can go to Shinto to go look for some clues

We patrol the residential district and make our way to the intersection.
There wasn't anything wrong with our side of town.
We can now go to the hill with the Western-style houses, and maybe even go as far as the Ryudou Temple

"Huh?"
A sudden chill runs up my spine.
"Saber, this is...!"
Saber must have felt it more clearly, as she looks over towards Shinto.

...The presence I felt starts to fade.
But I'm sure I heard a scream and felt a strong wave of magical energy.

I knew it.
This is what I hoped would happen.
So why is my mind paralyzed?

"!"
I was prepared to fight.
After I almost died, my hesitation vanished.
But now my body would not move, and my head would not give any orders.

It's probably too sudden.
I didn't expect to find it on the first day.
That's why I can't move. I'm used to getting attacked, but I'm not used to doing the attacking.
How stupid of me.
I'm fine with getting killed, but I never thought that I might have to do it myself

"The scream has stopped. The presence is fading away. I do not know what happened, but the victim will not live long."


That erases everything.
The numbness throughout my body disappears.
The fear that I might kill, is overridden by the fear that I might let someone die.

"I'm sorry, Saber...!"
I apologize for my cowardice and start to run full-speed.
We run to the origin of the scream, where we will fight someone to the death.
I'm not prepared at all.
My limbs are shaking.
It's a normal reaction.
This fear will always be there as long as I don't desire the Holy Grail and lack the will to fight.

"I'm a big damn idiot...!"
That's right.
If I have a reason to fight, I must believe in it.
If my enemies are arming their minds with "the desire for the Holy Grail"...
I must defeat this fear with "the desire to stop all conflicts"!
We should go patrol Shinto where there are more people.
The priest said I must fight if I do not want any victims out of this war.
As I am inexperienced as a Master, Saber and I can only hope to lure out the other Masters.
...It's not like I want to go with his plan, but using myself as bait is the only viable plan I can come up with.

"Let's go to Shinto. If a Master is planning something evil, it should be easier to do it in Shinto than over here."
"Understood. Then let us go."

...Going to Shinto means putting myself in danger.
...I must accept the possibility that I'll be killed.
I decided to fight, so I cannot make the same mistake as I did against Lancer.


...You can say I'm a total rookie, but I've trained my mind as a magus every night.
I steel up my mind just like when I insert the Magic Circuit into my back and start out for Shinto.

We patrol Shinto for about an hour.
We found nothing amiss, and Saber detected no signs of other Servants.

"So there's nothing wrong with Shinto, huh? I thought there would be some kind of a reaction if we walked around so defenselessly."
I scold myself for being too optimistic.
I bet Tohsaka could've done a much better job of searching the place.

"No, your decisions are correct. If there is a flaw in your plan, it is simply that your skills are not up to par.
 This was not wasted time.  Although we did not find anything tonight, I am sure there will be results if we continue this every night."

"Ugh... well, I hope so."
But it really hurts to know we're failing due to my lack of skill.

"Let's go back to Miyama City. We'll search my neighborhood if there's nothing in Shinto."
"Yes. Your enthusiasm is laudable, but we must first confirm the safety in our area."

We return to Miyama City.
There's nobody on the bridge, there's no trace of cars.
We cross the bridge within the silent night.
"!?"
At that instant.
I hear a scream as I feel a chill run up my back.

"It's close by...! Saber, what is this...!?"
"It is the presence of a Servant. It seems to be coming from the park below."

"!"
My heart starts to beat faster.
I knew it.
This is what I hoped would happen.
So why is my mind paralyzed?

I was prepared to fight.
After I almost died, my hesitation vanished.
But my body would not move, and my head would not give any orders.

...My naivety makes me want to puke.
I was not prepared at all.
There's no way I could have been. My mind only pretended to understand everything and my body is not used to fighting.
Yes.
To go to battle means...
To kill your enemy before your enemy kills you.


I can't move.
I'm used to getting attacked, but I'm not used to doing the attacking.
How stupid of me.
I'm fine with getting killed, but I never thought that I might be doing the killing

"Please give me an order, Master. I do not know what has happened, but our enemy is close by. We may be able to save the person who screamed if we move quickly."


That erases everything.
The numbness throughout my body disappears.
The fear that I might kill, is overridden by the fear that I might let someone die.

"I'm sorry, Saber...!"
I apologize for my cowardice and start to run full speed.
We run to the origin of the scream, where we will fight someone to the death.
I'm not prepared at all.
My limbs are shaking as I run.
It's the right reaction.
This fear will always be there as long as I don't desire the Holy Grail and lack the will to fight.

"I'm a big damn idiot...!"
That's right.
If I have a reason to fight, I must believe in it.
If my enemies are arming their minds with "the desire for the Holy Grail"
I must defeat this fear with "the desire to stop all conflicts"!
"Ha, ah!"
I run into the park.
The magical energy emitted is strong and ominous.
It's like oil polluting a clean stream.
Even I can feel energy this thick.

Saber stops.
She has analyzed the situation before me.

"Wha"
My body trembles.
My head loses its cool and fills with disgust and hatred.

...It's like seeing vampires in stories.
A woman in black has her mouth on an unconscious woman's neck.
The dripping blood is excessively fresh.

...That thing is eating a human being.
I don't mean that it's eating the human flesh.
That woman in black is sucking out what's inside the womanthings like her mind and her memory.
The unconscious woman does not move at all.
Her skin is like grave wax.  She looks like she's been turned into a doll.


My throat can't move.
It's not that I'm surprised the vampiric woman is a Servant.
My eyes focus behind heron the clear figure that is watching over the woman in black.

"Oh wow, it's Emiya. This is amazing. It's almost one of your strong points for your luck to be this bad."

"Shinji, you"
My mind is numb.
I can't grasp the situation.
I can't make the correct decision.
Why is he here?
What is that book in his hand?
How can he laugh when there's a woman that's about to die?
Why... Why is such a ridiculous thing taking place before my eyes!?

"Hey, why are you frozen up like that? You came here because you sensed a Servant here, right? Then do what you came to do. I staged this scenario so that even an idiot like you would understand."


He doesn't sound like the Shinji I know.
His voice is high-pitched.
Just hearing it makes me uncomfortable.

"Did you kill her?"
I clench my fists.
I don't even take notice of the Servant standing right there before me.
I must be crazy.
I should be fleeing in terror from this inhumanly powerful being, but I feel no fear.
My mind is about to explode.

"What? Are you stupid!? Humans are what Servants feed on! This is my only option."


"Well, I can't help it. She says she can only feed on live people. We have to keep feeding them magical energy to maintain them. I bet you were also looking for handy prey, right?"
I don't know what's funny, but Shinji laughs.

The Servant in black does not move.
Her pose is like that of a trained war dog.
She will not move on her own.
Like a puppet, she will not move without orders from her Master.
But she will turn into a murderous devil once the order is given.

"Get out of my way."
I say this with the hound in front of me.
There's no time to waste.
That woman might survive if I hurry.

"Huh? What do you mean by that? Are you talking to me!?
 Hah, I refuse. Come on if you want some leftovers.
 That's your familiar, right?"

"Shinji."
"Come on, let's make them fight. I did this so that I could see a fight between Servants. You're a Master, right? But all you're doing is trembling in fear. You're just like that woman there!"

"So you have no intention of withdrawing?"
"Man, you're persistent. Come and make me.
 Well
 It won't matter even if you just stand there and cower. I'm going to hurt you either way."

Shinji's eyes light up with hatred.
That must have been the order, as the Servant in black jumps forward and
"Stay back, Shirou!"
Saber moves to meet the attack of the Servant in black.

The two shadows collide.
Having armed herself immediately, Saber uses her invisible sword against her opponent.

The sound of clashing steel rings out.
Saber readies herself firmly on the ground, in contrast to the Servant in black who runs through the park.

Saber cannot keep up with the speed and goes into defense.
Her long hair fluttering behind her, the enemy closes in as if to corner a slow prey.

"Hah, she's just like a stone statue! So a Servant of a third-class magus is third-class as well!"
Standing away from the fight like me, Shinji laughs.
...I don't know how he became a Master, but it seems he's not a very talented magus.
Shinji does not provide his Servant with any support.
Then he must have become a Master by chance, like me


Saber blocks another attack and stops.
She looks troubled.
She glares in irritation at her lightning fast enemy.

"Go ahead and finish her, Rider!
 We followed grandfather's orders! It doesn't matter even if we kill Emiya's Servant!"

The black shadow speeds up.
The Servant in black follows her master's orders, speeds up to cut Saber's neck, and...
...Is sliced in half.

The match is decided in an instant.
Saber's sword cuts Rider's body, and the Servant in black is blown away.
It was like hitting a sandbag with a bat.
Saber is the batter and the blown sandbag is Rider, of course.

"......What?"
The mood changes.
Shinji blankly stares at Rider, who is wounded...
"No way."
...And I blankly stare at Saber, who puts away her sword disinterestedly.

"WWhat are you doing...!?"
He scorns his Servant.
Shinji yells without running over to his Servant, who has her belly sliced open.

"Who allowed you to get beat!? I can't believe this! You're going against my orders! I became your Master, so you can't get beat by Emiya's Servant...!"

"! Ah"
Rider strenuously raises her body in a pool of her own blood.
...But she cannot get up.
Her wound is fatal. Even though she is a Servant, she will die if she is not treated soon.

"Get up and fight, you corpse! You're not alive, so wounds shouldn't matter! Hey, why are you so slow, you piece of shit...! Man, you're embarrassing me! You're making me look like I'm the weaker one!"

Shinji curses Rider.
But Saber is unable to bear it.

"Blame yourself before you blame Rider. No matter how great a heroic spirit may be, it cannot fight to its full potential if it does not have an appropriate Master."

"......! Y-Y-You idiot! I'm telling you to get up! Your role is to protect your Master! If you can't win, use your life to stop them!"

"......That is meaningless as well. You cannot heal Rider even if you use your Command Spell. Even if you move Rider using your Command Spell, she will not even serve as a shield against me.
 It is over, Rider's Master.
 I do not wish to ask, but I shall follow my Master's orders and ask for you to surrender. Will you revoke your Command Spell and admit your defeat?"

"S-Shut up! Don't you dare order me, you monster...! Get up, Rider! I'm your Master! You're my dog, so listen to your master...!"

"! , !"
Sparks are flying around.
It must be because she cannot follow Shinji's orders, as pallid electric charges are tormenting her.

What a vicious cycle.
Rider cannot fight anymore.
But Shinji is condemning her for not being able to get up, despite the fact that her injuries are getting worse and her life is draining away.


Saber reaches out for Shinji.

"Hee! Get up and move, Rider...! If you're going to die, at least take her with you...!"
Rider reacts to Shinji's orders.
Rider's body moves to follow the order that has her death as its premise.

But then...
"Enough. It seems I was tossing pearls before swine, Shinji."
...The voice of an old man interrupts.

"Huh?"
The sound of crackling flames.
"W-What...!? My book is burning...!"
Shinji's book is burning.

"Why...!? Damn, go out! Why is my book burning!?"
He frantically beats at the fire, but it does no good.
The book turns to ashes, and at the same time...

...Rider disappears.

"...Hmph. I did not expect much of you, but this is worse than I thought. I gave you a chance since you are my grandson, but I cannot help but forsake you."
Where was he hiding?
An old manMatou Zouken appears out of the darkness of the night.

"G-Grandfather? Was that you...?"
"Who else could it be but me? You almost killed your Servant. And you call yourself my successor?"

"......! T-Then why did you get in my way!? I just have to win, right!? I'm the successor of the Matou family! I knew I couldn't get beat by a guy like this...!"

Shinji runs to the old man as if to cling onto him.
As he has lost Rider, his grandfather must be the only person he can rely on.
But...

"...Fool. I did not expect victory from a failure like you. What I expected was enough pride to challenge others in spite of your powerlessness.
 But you failed miserably. You disgraced the name of Makiri. Hmph, you and your father are both disgraces to our family."

"What? I'm the same as my father?"
"You fool. You are far worse. Your good-for-nothing father left an even more worthless son.
 ...I did not mind since I had some hopes for you, but you spoiled not only the family blood, but your spirit as well.
 The Matou bloodline ends with your generation."

The old man turns away from Shinji in disgust and walks toward us.
...Saber retreats. She must have felt something ominous in the old man.

"...Hm. I see, no wonder Rider was defeated. I presume you are a famed heroic spirit. I do not think a heroic spirit as great as you was ever summoned."
"......"

"Well, it seems my life will end here. No matter how pitiful he may be, he is still my grandson. I have to save him, even if it means my death. Heh, compassion towards family members can be a dangerous thing."

...I'm surprised.
It seems the old man stepped forward to give Shinji a chance to escape.
Matou Zouken must be confronting Saber so that he can protect Shinji, the one crawling in fear behind him.

"Leave quickly. Your book of contract has burned up, and you are no longer a Master. They should not attack you again if you make it out of here alive. Live the rest of your life as meaninglessly as your father did."
"!"
Shinji glares at the old man as he retreats.


Saber does not go after him.
She must not see the point of going after Shinji, who is not a Master anymore.

Shinji crawls away.
And when he gets to the edge of the park...
He turns around once and runs off like crazy.

My stomach turns sour.
I smell rotten meat from somewhere.

"Oh, so you let him go? ......I see, I see. Killing such an insignificant weakling would only dirty your sword."

"......"
Saber stands like a statue, her eyes locked with his.
...It seems like she is protecting me from his gaze.

"Can you back away, Saber? I know this old man. I want to talk to him."
"No. This man is not human. You should not have anything to tell him, nor should you have anything to hear from him."

"...I know. But I still have something I need to ask him. Please, this will be quick. You can decide whether to fight him or not after we talk."
"......"
Saber pulls herself back a bit.
She does not back up, but she is giving me the chance to talk to the old man.

"I'm sorry.
 ...So, how are you going to explain this?"
"What? You're quite the rude one, demanding explanations of me.
 I do not mind questions, but I will not be able to answer if I do not understand what you are asking me about."

"...It's about Shinji. Why is he a Master? It seemed like you made him into one. What's going on?"

"Oh, is that what you want to ask me? I do not even need to answer a question like that. As you say, I am the one who chose him as a Master. It has been long since I retired, as you can see.
 As I cannot fight, I gave the stage to my grandson."
"You made him a Masterthat means..."

"Yes. It is like you, successor of Emiya.
 I found out that the Holy Grail would appear, and I let my grandson make a contract with a Servant. You are of the lowest seat in a family of magi.
 You should understand me wanting to entrust my dream to my apprentice."


...Then what?
Magi become Masters.
So that means Shinji knows magic, and his family is a family of magi?

"Magiare you saying the Matou family is a family of magi?"
"You didn't know? The families of Matou and Tohsaka live in this land.
 But... our bloodline has died out.
 The Tohsaka family has the right to this land. The Matou family is living, clinging onto its former right."

"Tohsaka...? Then Tohsaka also knows that the Matou family is a family of magi!?"

"Of course. We were once allies. We have been enemies ever since the ritual became violent, but we are still colleagues with a shared ambition. We are friends outside of the Holy Grail War.
 Oh, that girl has succeeded him, huh?
 I have been away for about ten years, so I do not know how talented his apprentice is."

He laughs.
I don't know what kind of feelings he has for the Tohsaka family, but Matou Zouken laughs happily.

"...You said the Tohsaka family are your allies, right? Then has the Matou family been here since the very first Holy Grail War?"

"Yes. We were formerly called Makiri.
 We came to this country with the name Matou, but it seems that was a mistake. The land here does not suit us. Our bloodline has grown thin in the past two hundred years, and you have seen the failure we now have for a successor."

"Makiri."
They are actually called Makiri.
If Shinji is from a family of magi, then Sakura is...

"Hm? Oh, it's just a play on words. It is to hide our identity, but we cannot use just anything. Even our false name has to tie in to our real name."

I don't care about that.
There's only one question that matters now.

"Then is Sakurais Sakura a Master like Shinji?"
"That is a strange question. Sakura a Master? Such a thing is not possible. It seems your father has not taught you anything."

"It's not possible...? Does that mean Sakura has no talent?"

"The problem goes far deeper than that.
 First of all, magi families have only one inheritor. You only pass magic to the inheritor unless you are a distinguished family.
 And a sister of all that. You do not need two inheritors. We would have sent her out for adoption if our family had not died out, but nobody would take her since she lacks Magic Circuits."

"Then Sakura is..."
"It should be obvious, since Shinji is a Master. As she is not our successor, she does not even know that we are a family of magi.
 ...Well, I considered using her if her brother proved useless, but we have already lost. I won't involve someone who knows nothing of the Holy Grail War."


I sigh with relief.
...That's good.
I'm surprised the Matou family is a family of magi, and it's problematic that Shinji was a Master.
But I'm relieved to know that Sakura doesn't need to concern herself with such a murderous war.

"You said you guys already lost. That means Shinji won't fight anymore? You've retired, and Sakura has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War, right?"

"Correct.  But I cannot promise that Shinji will not try anything.
 He is stubbornly determined to be a magus.
 The Matou blood has grown weak since we came to this country, and he is our last heir. Children of the Matou family no longer have Magic Circuits."

"Hmph... I do not know how he found out about our family secret. He has pride in being the chosen one, but he grew up knowing that he is inferior.
 It is likely my fault for not being more strict with him, but his character is not something that can be easily corrected. He is beyond help if he cannot give up after such a crushing defeat."

The old man starts shrinking.
No, it's just an illusion. He was backing up silently.

"Anyway, Shinji lost. We have been eliminated from this warbut will you still kill this old man, Servant Saber?"

"If what you say is true, there is no reason for me to fight.
 But there will not be a next time if it is a lie. That goes the same for your successor. If he comes after my master again, I shall kill him without mercy."

"Understood."
The old man disappears.
...What is this?
Matou Zouken melts into the night, just like when he appeared.


All that's left is this rotten smell.
I force down the feelings of nausea and pick up the unconscious woman.

"Let's go to the church, Saber. We'll still make it. He should be able to do something."
"I know. I shall take the woman."
"...? Oh, thanks, Saber."

I let Saber carry the woman.
There's no time to waste. Even though Saber is smaller than me, she is more powerful. I should let her handle this instead of trying to show off.

"I shall lead the way. Please stay behind me."
Saber starts running.
I run full speed after her so I won't get left behind.
I leave the church.
Saber must have been waiting under cover, as she appears as soon as I come through the door.

"Are you done with your inquiry, Shirou?"
"Yeah. I heard about my father and what kind of a relationship he had with the Einzbern family. He also warned me about what I should do. He's more talkative than he looks.
 He recommended a lot of things to me."

"Huh...? T-That priest was cooperative?"
I don't know what's wrong, but Saber is bewildered.


"S-Shirou? What is wrong? Did he ask for something in compensation? Kuh, why did you not call for me!? You said you would call for me if there was any danger...!"

I must have had a strange expression because Saber draws near and peers at my face.


"So what did he do to you, Shirou...!? Your wound has not healed yet. You should know something like last night could happen again if you let your guard down...!"
Saber draws even closer.


"Please show me your wound, Shirou! I am partly responsible for it. I cannot let you die without returning my debt. I have not helped you as a Servant yet. I cannot allow our contract to end like this...!"

Saber reaches for my shirt as if to rip it off.
She doesn't look scary at all, but rather...

"Kuh."
Oh, crap. I was trying to hold it in, but I my laughter spills out.
"......Shirou?"
Her hand stops.
She realizes what I've been trying to suppress and glares at me.

"Shirou. It is not good to enjoy someone else's confusion."
"!"
Her protest is so entertaining that it brings a smile to my face.

"Shirou!"
"KuhI'm sorry. I was just surprised because you were in such a panic. Um, it was a fortunate misunderstanding, or something like that."

"...A 'fortunate misunderstanding,' eh? I feel some hidden meaning in that. Are you going to explain to me what it means?"

I must have hit a nerve because she gets even more emotional.
Saber's like the class president type.
She seriously gets mad when I do something stupid. And since she's serious, her real character appears.

"What are you smiling for...!? Is it that funny that I misunderstood your condition!?"

"I'm sorry. To be honest, I'm just happy. You're really energetic right now."
"...? There is nothing wrong with my condition, but what about it?"

"No, that's not what I'm talking about. It's just that this is the first time I've seen your real personality. I'm glad I can see that you're a girl."

"Wha"
Saber jumps back.

"W-What are you saying? The gender of the Servant does not matter. We are here only to fight, so please do not get happy over such a thing."
She glowers at me, probably because she's mad or astonished.


But I somehow don't feel bad, and I'm still smiling.

Even though she's a Servant, she's as human as she appears.
I don't know about the other Servants, but the girl I made a contract with is not just a familiar that only knows combat.

She said she has not helped me yet.
She saved me from Lancer and she tried to let me escape from Berserker.
She saved my life twice, but she still thinks she hasn't helped me yet.

"I wonder if she's good-natured, or just a perfectionist."
"W-What is that look? Even if you are my Master, there are some remarks I cannot ignore. I have appropriate plans if you say anything more."

"All right, all right. I understand, so don't get too mad. I'm just saying I'm glad you're the one I made a contract with."

"W-What are you saying? I was only summoned by you.
 I did not make a contract with you out of choice. You were the one who chose me."

"It was only an accident, though. ...Yeah, that's what I regret. I wanted to make the conscious choice to choose you."

I hold out my right hand.
This is something I wasn't able to do at the very beginning.
I have to make the promise I should've made before.

"Shirou...?"
"This is a bit late, but can I? This is the only way I know how."
Without a word, Saber walks over to me and shakes my hand.
Her slender fingers.
I feel her warmth through my hand.

"Will you fight with me from now on? I need your help, Saber."
"My oath will not change. I was summoned to be your sword."

"And we both need each other's help.
 I will borrow your strength to obtain the Holy Grail. If you trust me, I will do my best to live up to that trust."

Her hand is warm.

The hesitation within me disappears without a trace.
It has been half a day since the night it all began.
I am finally able to realize that she is my ally who will fight alongside me.
We will wait until nightfall to go out into the city.
After some discussion, that is what we decided.

As Kotomine said, I can't sense other Masters.
Saber is the only one who can sense our enemies, and even then, she's only able to sense nearby Servants.

So naturally, our plan is to walk around and find information.
It's like counting on luck, but it's "risky but certain" according to Saber.

Masters aren't going to be holed up in their hideouts all the time.
If the Holy Grail War is a race, you have to do something to get ahead of the competition.
That means the Servants search for the enemy's hideout while the Masters use magic to set up traps.
We can use that to our advantage.

Lots of magical energy will be needed if either one does something. Even though I can't sense other magi, I can detect the lingering traces of their power.
If we patrol the city looking for that, I'm sure we'll find some signs of other Masters.

...This is information I'll be getting by using myself as bait.
I have no other method besides being bait, just like Kotomine said.

We'll start the patrols tonight.
Saber told me to stay at the house, but I refused, saying I would go with her.

After a long, unproductive talk...
"...All right. But please promise you will always be with me. Can you swear not to go outside by yourself at night?"

...Saber finally accepted my point of view.

Well.
Our course of action is decided, but there are two more problems.

"Shirou. I have explained to you before, but I cannot afford to use too much magical energy, especially if we plan to patrol tonight."

"Yeah. You're going to sleep as much as you can to preserve magical energy, right?
 Since I can't provide you with magical energy, you have to maintain your body yourself.
 So, say you can regenerate 8 units of magical energy per day and you need 6 units to sustain yourself daily. That excess 2 units is what we can save up.
 And if you conserve well, you could use about 10 units during a battle, right?"

"That is true as long as I am not wounded or my armor does not become damaged. But against heroic spirits of such rank, that is not likely.
 To put it in your terms, I used about 50 units against Lancer, and about 200 units against Berserker."

She was pierced by Lancer, and her stomach was slashed by Berserker.
It makes sense for her to have used a lot of magical energy to heal those wounds.
It makes sense, but...

"I did not use that much magical energy to heal myself. I used it more to restore the armor that was destroyed. Most of my magical energy is fixed on protecting me."

...That's how it is, according to her.

"So your armor is part of your body, right? So maintaining your body and your armor is the same thing. You have your armor off right now to preserve magical energy, right?"

"Yes. But things like this should not be necessary for other Servants. I can only disarm myself since I cannot turn into spirit form, but Servants such as Archer and Lancer can become spirits to reduce the burden on their Masters."
"I see, I see. ...Oh, I guess this is good enough."

"Shirou. It is helpful that you are preparing our meal, but do you not think it is easing the tension?"
"Huh? No, I don't think so."

I don't, but it is true my sense of urgency disappeared.
I was surprised when Saber told me about her condition after our strategy meeting.
As I don't provide her with magical energy, she has her hands full with maintaining her body.
I tried to change our course of action, saying that it should be impossible for her to fight in that condition, but...

"Hey Saber. Let me ask you again, but how much magical energy do you have right now?"
"In your terms, I have about 1000 units."
So it's something ridiculous like that.

She said she spent about two hundred against Berserker, but she still has that much magical energy remaining.
And she says it's not full. It's scary to think how much magical energy she would've had with a proper Master.
Her capacity is way beyond human, and I stop stupidly thinking how many times more of my magical energy it would take to fill her up.
I finally understand why Tohsaka called Saber "the most superior Servant".

"...Of course I'm not nervous anymore. There's nothing to worry about if you have that much magical energy and we only have to face six enemies."

"That is only if I am to fight them.
 I told you earlier, but using a Noble Phantasm takes lots of magical energy. It is hard to use my Noble Phantasm in my current state. Therefore I must save up as much magical energy as I can."

Saber's mad.
I can't tell if she's mad at me for being a burden, or because I'm keeping her here when she has to sleep.

"I understand your magical energy is important, but so is food, right? I used leftovers for lunch, so please eat a proper meal for dinner. You can sleep after you eat."

"......All right. I do not intend to use my Noble Phantasm lightly. We shall talk about this later when you have a better understanding of what Servants are."
Saber says this in a dissatisfied manner and takes a seat.

Good.
She might complain, but she always listens to me.
So the problem of "conserving magical energy" is settled now.
In the first place, it's not something we can do anything about, and the only way to help ourselves is to get a better understanding of our current situation.
So...

"But, Shirou. You said you have two problems. What is the other problem?"
"Huh? Oh, it'll come soon. Please do as I said."
I cut some white radishes and put them into the saucepan.

"...?"
Saber tilts her head in confusion.
There...
"I'm home! Are you cooking, Shirou!?"
"Excuse me, Senpai."
...I hear the usual voices from the entrance.

"......"
"......"
"......"
The silence is painful.
It's only natural. Fuji-Nee and Sakura are confused, and they're looking at me for an explanation.

"This is Saber. She's going to be staying at this house starting today. Please give her your best regards."

It's been ten minutes since that was my explanation to them.

This lack of protest feels awkward.
I want to take a sip of tea, but I feel like the sound of it would echo through the room, so the hot tea sits there untouched.
But sitting here won't solve anything.
I have to move forward with courage.

"We can't turn her away since she came here for my father. She won't stay long as she's only here for sightseeing. Also, she'll be staying in the separate building so it won't be a problem."

"......"
"......"
"......"

...The silence continues.
By the way...
I can understand why Sakura and Fuji-Nee are quiet, but why is Saber looking so surprised?

"Phew. Well, if she's an acquaintance of Kiritsugu-san, it can't be helped. I heard he had some relatives overseas, so, was it... Saber-san? She seems reliable, so I have no objections."

"...Um. Fujimura-Sensei, that's..."
"I'm sorry. I understand how you feel, but this is Kiritsugu-san's house. It would be shameful for us Japanese to throw out a foreigner who came here relying on us, right? It's been getting dangerous lately, so we can't just throw this cute girl out on the streets."

"......That's true, but... is this okay with you, Senpai?"
"Yeah, this is what I intended. I'm going to have Saber stay here for a while. Are you against it, Sakura?"
"...No, I do not mind if an acquaintance of yours stays here, butum, Saber is..."

"Hm? Oh, it's a strange name, right? She's blunt like her name suggests, but I guarantee she's a good person. She might sound strange since she's not used to Japan, but it'll really help me out if you can help her out, Sakura."

"......All right. If you're fine with it, then I am too."
Is she nervous because Saber's a foreigner?
Sakura nods while looking away from her.

So it's dinnertime.
I put extra effort into dinner to welcome Saber and to make up for lunch.

I made minced bonito salad, fried chicken with hot sauce, meat and potato stew, and lots of tempura including shrimp tempura.

The dinner I put so much effort into is...
Unpopular with the main guest and my pupil.

"Wow, what is this tempura!? 'Juicy' and 'tasty' don't begin to describe it! What did you do, Shirou!? I have a better opinion of shrimp now!"

"............"
Well...
It's all good since Fuji-Nee's enjoying it enough for the four of us.

Dinner ends without trouble thanks to her.
I don't know what happened, but Fuji-Nee gave some of her food to Saber.
I guess Fuji-Nee likes Saber because she is quiet.

"......"
Saber and Fuji-Nee left to prepare Saber's room.
And Sakura and I clean up after dinner.
Well, there's nothing wrong with that, because it's part of the usual chores.

"I'll wash the dishes, so can you clean the table?
 Oh, you don't have to throw away the tempura oil. Can you put the lid on it and store it? It's heavy. Can you handle it?"
"Huh...? Oh, yes. I'm stronger than I look, you know?"

She picks up the pot of oil.
Good, so since she does archery, I didn't need to worry.
"Well, archery isn't all about strength either..."
I wash the dishes.

Then...
"Huh? There's less towels here, Senpai. The paper towel roll is empty and the plates are moved around."
"What? Let's see... Oh, you're right. Did someone break in?"

"Hmm. I don't think there are robbers that only steal towels."
"Right. That's no robber."

The plates have been moved around.
The paper towels are gone.
Some towels are missing.
According to these clues...

"Oh. That's right. Tohsaka was here."
I remember now.

Tohsaka was the one who treated me after that incident with Berserker.
I'm pretty sure that she used the paper towels during my treatment.

"Senpai. Do you mean Tohsaka-Senpai?"
"Yeah. I had her come in.
 Um, I had a stupid accident and hurt myself. Tohsaka just happened to pass by and she kindly treated me. As expected from our school's honor student, right? She's so full of affection."

I don't mean the last half, of course.
My school's proud honor student died last night.
It's highly regrettable, but the image of "Tohsaka Rin as an honor student" died inside of me.

"...Why?"
"Hm?"
"Why did Tohsaka-Senpai come here? That's strange. She has nothing to do with this place. I'm here, and she has no connection with Senpai, so why?"

Sakura hangs her head and tries to control herself.
"......"
I'm at a loss for words at this sudden event.
She hugs herself tightly as if enduring some uneasiness.
The church is lit, even though it's midnight.
I took the woman from Saber and entered the church alone.
When I yelled for Kotomine, he came out and quickly retreated to the back with the unconscious woman.
He said that his room was the only place he would be able to treat her.

"Phew."
I sit down.
...I've done all I could.
Now, it's up to Kotomine.
I'll believe in him and wait.


...I keep waiting.
I'm worried about Saber, who is waiting outside, but I can't leave.

AndI want to think by myself for a while.
The Matou family was a family of magi.
Shinji became a Master and obtained a Servant.
Matou Zouken had his successor participate in the Holy Grail War, even though he lost his powers as a magus.

"......"
The Einzbern family aren't the only ones obsessed with the Holy Grail.
Makiri and Tohsaka.
No, in the first place, the only ones who become Masters are those who cling to the Holy Grail.

...Saber is no exception.
The Einzbern family has sought the Holy Grail for a thousand years.
Their persistence is not something I can do anything about.
They can only be saved by the Holy Grail.

My father went against them and destroyed it.
But would I be able to pursue my wish to such lengths?
Like the Einzbern and Makiri families...
Do I have the right to compete against those who have sought the Holy Grail for centuries?

"How surprising. I did say you could bring wounded people here, but I did not think you would bring one on the same exact day."
"Kotomine"
I raise my head.
He doesn't look gloomy.
Then that must mean the treatment was successful.

"Kotomine. How is the woman doing?"
"She survived, but the rest is up to her. If you were an hour later, I would've had to see her as a priest."

"I see. I'm sorry I troubled you.
 ...Um, I'm glad you were awake."
"You're thanking me? Are you sick? I will listen if something is worrying you."

"...I am worried about many things, and you are the cause of most of them. I'll pass on another long talk with you."

"Oh, so our conversation earlier was just a bother? ...Hm, I meant to give you a boost, but it only gave you more worries, huh? I should reflect on my actions as well."
The priest shuts his mouth, looking regretful.

"......"
It's not that I'm letting him get to me, but...
"......Um.
 A guy I know turned out to be a Master."
...Not being able to bear it by myself, I just have to say it.

The priest says nothing.
He just nods.

"So of course you defeated the Master, right?"
I nod in response to his short question.

"Then do not regret it. People cannot change the past.
 All we can do is to accept our own actions.
 If you still wish to be burdened with your sins, let it show in your future actions. It is your choice how to perceive something that has already happened."

"......"
His words are plausible.
...The problem isn't that Shinji was a Master, that the Matou family is a family of magi, or that the Einzbern family tenaciously pursues the Holy Grail.
The important thing is what I'm going to do from now on.

"I'm going home. Please take care of that woman."
I get up to leave the church.
Saber is waiting for me outside.
There's no more reason for me to stay here if the woman is all right.

"Hold on, Emiya Shirou. I shall give you one piece of advice."
"...What? I told you I'm not listening to your endless rambling again."
"I will be brief, but I deserve some compensation for being asked to treat a woman so late at night."
"......"
I can't object if he puts it like that.
I reluctantly turn around to see that the priest is right behind me.

"It is something I forgot to tell you.
 The Einzbern family has endured for a thousand years in pursuit of their one wish. Yes, it is a serious matter now that I say it. It is natural for you to be overwhelmed."
"......"
...This is why I don't like this guy.
He accurately points out my doubts even when I haven't said anything.

"...Shut up. Are you going to bring that up again?"

"No. I am telling you that it is nothing to be concerned about.
 There is no need to view this as anything special. This war is just a common thing.
 The Holy Grail War is the materialization of our everyday life and people's happiness. There is no crime in participating."

"Everyone desires something and people fight for what they want. That is what defines life. It is something shared by all, even if the scale of those desires is different.
 There isn't a person in this world who does not try to make his wish come true.
 The outcome, of course, is another matter. People may live to make their dreams come true, but some of them die before they reach their goals."

"There is an order to things. An appropriate accumulation of effort is needed to make dreams come true. This is what people call life.
 The Holy Grail simply removes the need for that effort.
 It is merely a simplification of life."

"So there is nothing special about it.
 The seven Masters are just trying to reduce the journey undertaken during their lifetimes via the shortcut called the Holy Grail.
 Everything else is the same. It is human nature to paint over others' wishes with your own.
 The Holy Grail War is no different from your life.
 Do as you please throughout this war and win."

"......"
He says cheerfully...
There is no difference between a vulgar wish and a noble one.
The quality of the wish is irrelevant.
I just need to trample over the wishes of others
...I don't know if it's sarcasm or not.
But he is seriously saying even an incomplete Master like me is worthy to fight.

"...That's not like you. Why are you suddenly worrying about others?"
"Well, it is because our talk earlier was not helpful. I cannot call myself a priest if people coming to me because they are worried leave with even more doubts."
...Man.
I bet Tohsaka would say he makes a lousy priest to start with.

"Don't worry about that. Bye, you fake priest."
"Yes. Come again if you have not had enough."
I snort and walk to the exit.
I leave the church for sure this time.

Saber is waiting outside.
...I think it was like this earlier too.
Saber waits for me in the cold winter night without complaining.

A Master and a Servant might have this kind of a relationship, but Saber is by my side because she is concerned for my safety.
I believe I have to answer her with the best honesty I have.

"That woman's all right thanks to you, Saber."
"You do not need to thank me. It was you who tried to save her. I only abided by your decision."
"!"
Her expression is very gentle.

"Oh... no, that's not true. You're the one who saved her. I wouldn't have made it in time by myself. And most of all"

I think Saber let Matou Zouken go to save that woman.
We would've ended up fighting if we stopped that old man there. She definitely would've died.
Saber took that into consideration and let him go.

"W-What is it, Shirou? Um, it seems you are smiling for no reason at all."
"Huh? Oh, I have a reason. I'm glad you're the person I thought you were. Thank you, Saber, for going along with my unreasonable plan."

"W-What are you saying? I do not think your plan is an unreasonable one"

"Really? You said I was too lenient and too optimistic.
 You looked like you might not go along with the plan when the time came."

"I-I never looked that way! I only told you that my own judgment would take priority if you were in danger! How can you doubt me, Shirou?"
Saber frowns.


I smile, since her expression is totally different now.

"Shirou. It seems I will need to teach you some manners one of these days."
"Yeah, please do if there's a chance. But Saber... Let's end this war for now."

"Shirou...?"
"I didn't need the Holy Grail like you.
 Before, I just wanted to stop the fighting, and then give you the Holy Grail if we survived until the very end. I wondered if an amateur like me was appropriate for you."

"I see. Then what about now? Tonight, you experienced a battle you chose to start yourself. Have your thoughts changed?"

"No, not at all. I'm still against the Holy Grail War.
 But I'll fight until the end for sure.
 I have no wish that I need the Holy Grail to grant.
 ...But I want to protect others, like a superhero.
 I don't think my wish is inferior. So I have to fight against the wishes of others, even if they are five hundred or a thousand years old."

"I see. That is understandable."

"Then I shall swear again.
 I will be your sword for as long as you are a worthy master. As long as you remain yourself, Shirou,I will never betray your trust."
"Ohyeah, I'll do my best, Saber."

Her direct smile is embarrassing, so I look up.
The winter's chill makes the starry sky more beautiful.

'I will never betray you.'

I look up at the night sky, a world apart from tonight's events.
The girl that waited for me in this cold weather said that.
Then I'll believe in myself...
...So that I can always be worthy of her trust.
...So that I will be able to look back on my actions without regret.
"Well."
I take a breath and analyze the situation.
I haven't had time to think since I saw that fight between Lancer and Archer last night.

"...Oh. I see. Then that must've been Tohsaka."
I finally realize it.

I was stabbed by Lancer after that, was saved for some reason, and attacked by Lancer again
"Saber saved me, and I became a Master."
What I heard at the church.
The killing called the Holy Grail War.
The Holy Grail which grants any wish, given to the winner.

...I can't absorb all the facts, but I have been attacked three times already.
So I can't sit here in confusion forever.
I said I would fight, since I could not sit by and do nothing.
I won't allow any innocent people to get hurt.

Since that day ten years ago, I have trained to become a superhero.
I never thought I would be tested like this, but I won't back out now.

I'll cast off all hesitation.
Come to think of it, this is an opportunity.
This is a chance to "help others" just like Emiya Kiritsugu.
"......"
But something lingers in the back of my mind...

    Rejoice, Emiya Shirou.

The backwards desire that should not be wished for...

    Your wish will finally come true.

...Might be a distorted wish for a superhero...

"That can't be. I didn't want the Holy Grail War."
...There's no need to hesitate.
There is nothing wrong with the wish I've had for ten years.
Emiya Shirou will become a superhero.
I have trained in magic to help others.

"All right. I need to talk with Saber."
I shake off the priest's words and exit into the hallway.

I look through the house.
I look everywhere someone could possibly be, including all the guest rooms, but I can't find her.

"That's strange... She's in that outfit, so you'd think it'd be easy to find her."
And yet I can't find her anywhere.
I guess Servants can become spirits, but I can't turn her into one anyway.
No, first of all

"Even though they call me a Master, I don't know anything about her."

I don't know who she is or how she can exist.
The only thing I understand is...
No matter how superior they are, they can still get hurt in a fight and bleed if they are wounded.

"Oh."
Saber is in the silent dojo.
But her appearance is different from yesterday.
She sits Japanese-style on the wooden floor without her armor.
Her clothes are now refined and suit her well as she sits quietly.


...I lose my voice at the sight.
Sitting with her back straight and eyes closed, Saber looks beautiful.
Melting into the silence, she reminds me of pure water.


And that removes the last of the doubts within me.
Even if she is a Servant, there's something holy about her.
SoI won't be led astray if I'm with her.

"Saber."
I call out.
Saber slowly opens her eyes and returns my gaze.

"You are awake, Shirou."
A calm voice.
Surprisingly suited to this place, her voice echoes through the dojo as if permeating it.

"Yeah. I just got up. What were you doing here?"
"I was resting. I cannot treat you, so I thought I'd make sure I was in perfect condition."

"!"
Saber looks at me as she speaks.
...Well, um...
I feel a tension, different from the kind I felt with Tohsaka.

"Shirou? What is it? Could it be that your body is still...?"
"...! N-No, there's no problem...! I'm just perplexed for my own reasons, so don't worry...!"
I take a step back and shake my head.

"...?"
Looking away from Saber, who is tilting her head questioningly, I calm my pounding heart.

"...Calm down. What am I so tense about!?"
I take a deep breath.
...But it doesn't seem to die down quickly. In fact, I don't think it ever will.
"...Man, why did she get changed...?"

I complain without meaning to.
Saber's clothes are so real that they make me conscious of her womanhood, whether I like it or not.

...She is terribly beautiful.
I thought I figured that out yesterday, but she really hits me with it now.
Perhaps her armor looked so surreal I didn't notice yesterday.
But when she dresses like a girl, I'm flustered, as any healthy guy would be.

"Shirou."
I tense up the moment our eyes meet.
But I didn't look for her just to say nothing. I'm troubled, but I can't stay quiet forever.

"All right.
 May I, Saber? It'll be the first time we sit down and talk"
I make up my mind and talk to her.
And then.

"Shirou. Before that, there is something I would like to address regarding last night."
Her previous gentleness goes away and she stops me in displeasure.

"? All right, what is it?"

"It is about last night.
 You are my Master. It is troubling if you take such actions. Battle is my duty, so you must concentrate on your role. If you go and die in vain, there is no way I can protect you."

She states it clearly.
That makes the tension I was feeling vanish.

"W-What do you mean!? You would have been slashed if I didn't do that!"

"In that case, I would have just died. It was not something you should have been hurt over.
 I repeat myself. Please do not that again.
 There is no need for my Master to protect me, and there is no reason for it either."
She says this rather simply.
It must be because she sounds so practical.

"Whadon't be stupid. You don't need a reason to save a girl...!"
I react without meaning to.

Maybe she was surprised at being yelled at, but she pauses for a moment as if I did something unexpected.
And then, she stares at me with indescribable dignity.

"Uh..."
I back up a bit, being stared at.
Her look makes me realize what I've said, and I suddenly feel embarrassed.

"A-Anyway, I'm grateful you brought me home. Thank you."

I thank her while looking away.
...It's awkward to thank her in the first place, but it's even more awkward to thank her in this situation.
But still, before anything else, I have to thank her for helping me.

"You are welcome. It is natural for a Servant to protect her Master, but I am happy to be thanked. You are very polite."
"No. I'm not polite."

So there's something I need to clarify right now.
It's something I should have asked her the moment we got back last night.
If she really is my Servant....
And if she really is going to be joining this battle...

"Going back to our conversation, Saber.
 ...Oh, I'll ask formally. Can I call you Saber?"

"Yes. Since I have formed a contract with you as a Servant, I am your sword. I shall follow your orders, defeat your enemies, and protect you."
She says without the slightest hesitation.
There's no room for argument.

"Become my sword, huh? Is that to win this Holy Grail War?"
"...? Is that not why you have summoned me?"

"No. I only summoned you by chance.
 As you know, I'm only an amateur magus. I'm sorry, but I have neither the knowledge nor the power of a Master.
 But I've decided to fight, so I'll fight. I'm an unskilled Master, are you okay with that?"

"Of course. You are my Master, Shirou.
 This fact will not change. A Servant does not have the freedom to choose her Master."

...I see.
Then I should try to respond to her to the best of my ability.

"...All right. So you're content with me as your Master?"

"Yes. But Shirou, I shall not allow defeat for my Master.
 If you have no chance of victory, I shall make one for you. I will use any means possible to have you obtain the Holy Grail.
 We Servants do not serve the Masters without compensation. We serve because we also desire the Holy Grail."

"Huh? Hold on. The Holy Grail, you mean you want it too...!?"

"Of course. After all, the only ones who can touch the Holy Grail in spirit form are we Servants, who are also spirits.
 The Master that wins the Holy Grail War will obtain the Holy Grail through the medium of their Servant. After that, the Servant who served the winning Master will have its wish granted in compensation.
 That is the relationship between Masters and Servants."


...I see.
Now that she says it, it's obvious something like a "heroic spirit" would never obey a mere human being.
Since they have their own objectives, they serve the Master in exchange.

...Then that means Saber has a wish she wants granted.
That is why she has no doubts.

But...

"...Hold on, Saber. You said any means possible, right? Does that mean you don't care what measures you take to win the war?
For example"

Doing something like what that priest said.
Involving innocent people and creating a disaster like what happened ten years ago

"Shirou, that is not a possibility.
 I can only do things I allow myself to do. I cannot betray my beliefs. It is against the knight's oath to hurt those who are unarmed."

 But I must obey your orders. You will have to use one of your Command Spells to compensate for trampling over me."
I am overwhelmed by her angered voice.


But still, I'm happy and relieved.
Her lack of doubt gave her the image of a cold fighting machine, but I know now that she is not a cold-blooded killer.

"Yeah, I won't let you do that.
 Like you said, we have to do our best with what we can do. ...I'm really sorry. I insulted you without realizing it."

"Ah... no, I leapt to a conclusion without knowing your intentions. You are not at fault, so please raise your head..."
"Huh? Oh, sorry, I apologized without realizing it."
I raise my head.


I don't know what's so funny, but Saber has a small smile on her face.

"...?"
Well, I'm glad she's smiling, so I won't ask her about it.

"...All right. Then can I ask you something else? A Master is a magus that summons Servants, right?
 That's fine, but I don't quite understand you guys. Like, Saber and Lancer, I know those aren't your real names."

"Yes, those are only the names of the classes given to us. ...Very well, I shall describe it briefly since we have the chance."

"We Servants are heroic spirits.
 We each have won fame during our lives or have accomplished some great deed beyond human ability.
 Whatever the means, we are beings that have reached the rank of gods with our own strength."

That doesn't even need to be said.
Heroic spirits are heroes that had supernatural abilities while they were alive, whose fame was such that they were promoted into the ranks of spirits after death instead of becoming mere ghosts.

"But that is also to our disadvantage. As we are heroes, our weaknesses have been recorded.
 Revealing our names, revealing our identities, means revealing our weaknesses.
 It is no problem if we fight lower spirits, but we are all capable of defeating each other. If our weaknesses are revealed, the enemy will take advantage of them to defeat us."

"...I see. Heroes usually do have opponents they're weak against. That's why you're hiding your real name and using the name Saber?"

"Yes. However, I am not called Saber only for that reason.
 There are seven Servants called forth by the Holy Grail, and every one of these is selected according to their class."

"Class...? You mean like Saber and Archer?"

"Yes. Summoning a true heroic spirit is already almost a miracle. To summon seven is too much even for the Holy Grail.
 As a solution, the Holy Grail prepares seven vessels in advance and only calls forth heroic spirits compatible with these vessels.
 Those are the seven classes.

 Saber.
 Lancer.
 Archer.
 Rider.
 Caster.
 Assassin.
 Berserker.

"The Holy Grail calls forth from all times the heroic spirits, with abilities corresponding to each of these classes.
 And those who receive these classes are called Servants."

"...I see. So you were a heroic spirit skilled with swords, so you were summoned as Saber?"
"Yes. There are heroic spirits that have multiple attributes, but I believe I am the best when it comes to swords."

"But that is also the weakness of the Saber class.
 Since I am not a magus, I can only defeat your enemies as your sword."

"So you're not well-suited to trickery. No, I don't think that's a weakness. You're powerful, so that should be enough, right?"

"Shirou, you cannot win this war just by being strong in battle.
 For instance, if your enemy is stronger than you in combat, what will you do?"

"Huh? Well... if I knew I couldn't beat them in combat, I'd have to do something without fighting"

Having said that much, I understand.
If the enemies are strong, you wouldn't fight a proper battle.
Beating opponents with your sword isn't the only way to fight.
If you can't beat an enemy head-on, you'll have to do it some other way.

"Exactly. If your enemy discovers you are skilled in combat, your enemy will most likely not challenge you in combat. ...And in that sense, Servants that lack ability will use any means possible."

"The Servant Assassin has low attributes, but has a special ability to hide its presence, and the Servant Caster is versed in magic that does not exist in this age.
 You cannot be optimistic because of a mere difference in power. And on top of that, we have our 'Noble Phantasms'. No matter what kind of Servant we are, as heroic spirits, we have our guaranteed fatal attack."

"Noble Phantasm?"
That's not a term I've heard before.
I think I might know what it means from the sound of it, though...

"Noble Phantasms are special weapons carried by Servants.
 Weapons like Lancer's lance, Archer's bow, and my sword are such.
 Heroes are not called heroes by themselves. Heroes have weapons that symbolize them and make them heroes."

"The hero and his weapon are one. So those who became heroic spirits wield a powerful weapon.
 That is the 'Noble Phantasm'the trump card for Servants, and the thing we must take the most care of."


...Saber says that Noble Phantasms are weapons that heroes wielded when they were alive.

I recall that blue knight.
The lance that absorbed magical energy from the air and pierced Saber's chest with incredible movements.
That was certainly not something fit for humans.
That lance itself carried a strong curse, but I also felt an overwhelming amount of magical energy in the word Lancer said back then.
Then could it be...?

"Saber. Are Noble Phantasms magic?
 Lancer's lance certainly seemed like a lance with history, but the lance itself wasn't extraordinary.
 But that lance went beyond the realm of weapons with his words. Isn't that some sort of magic?"

"Yes, Noble Phantasms are certainly similar to magic.
 For example, Lancer's lance itself is a Noble Phantasm, but it demonstrates its full potential only when he puts magical energy into it and says its true name."

"A Noble Phantasm could be called a materialized divine mystery.
 As spells are necessary to activate magic, recitation of the true name is necessary to awaken and to activate the Noble Phantasm.
 But that is also dangerous. By saying the true name of their Noble Phantasm, the identity of the Servant is revealed."

"...Oh yeah. Heroes and their weapons are one. If you know the weapon's name, you naturally know the identity of the owner."
Saber nods silently.

That is why the Noble Phantasm is a trump card.
In exchange for revealing the name, it launches an unavoidable fatal blow.
But when it does not prove fatal... the Servant will expose all its weaknesses.

"Then, Saber. Is your Noble Phantasm that invisible sword?"

"...Yes. But I have not revealed its identity yet. No Servants should know my true name at this point."
Having said that, Saber looks down awkwardly for a second.

"Shirou. I have a request about that matter."
"Huh? What kind of request?"

"About my real name. Usually, Servants give their true names to their Master only, to determine future plans.
 But you are an inexperienced magus.
 A superior magus would be able to read your mind, so"

"Oh, so you can't tell me your real name? ...Yeah, you're right. Like hypnotism, suggestion, or... well, I don't think there'd be any, but if any other Master had mystic eyes, I might just start babbling about it.
 All right. Let's do that. I'll rely on you to decide when to use your Noble Phantasm."

"Uhum, can you really decide that so quickly?"
"It wasn't easy. I thought it through.
 I agreed after thinking about it, so don't worry."


...Well.
I get most of this stuff, but I still don't have a grasp of the situation.

This is strange, now that I think about it.
Even though I've decided to fight, the only enemy I know is Tohsaka, and I don't intend to fight her.
Well, I shouldn't be thinking like that because Tohsaka is ready to fight me any day.

"Hey Saber, do Servants and Masters have some sort of mark? I don't really know what I should be doing."

"No. Unfortunately, there is no clear way to distinguish them.
 But if other Servants are near, Servants are able to sense them. All the more if they are materialized. Servants themselves are powerful magic.
 I am sure you felt Berserker's presence."

"Ughthat is true. But it's bad to be able to tell only when you're attacked. I need to at least know before they approach, so I can take some sort of countermeasure."

"Then, how about searching for the Master's presence? Masters are magi. Since they use magic for a living, they will leak magical energy. If you search for that, you may be able to identify the Masters in this town."
"...Sorry. Unfortunately, I can't do that sort of thing."

After all, I didn't even realize Tohsaka's real identity, and she goes to the same school as I do.
We were in the same building for two years, and on top of that, I've seen her several times.

"Geez. No wonder people call me an amateur. The only evidence I'm even a Master is this Command Spell. It seems there'll be lots of difficulties ahead."
I sigh.
And then.

"Shirou. Could you close your eyes for a moment?"
Saber speaks with a serious expression on her face.
"...? Close my eyes? Why?"
"To prove that you are a Master. Just close your eyes and breathe normally."

"......"
...I close my eyes.
I feel a faint pressure on my forehead.
Hey, it's prickling. Could this be the end of her sword!?

"Saber? Hold on, are you doing something weird?"
"...Master, please stay silent and concentrate on my fingertip. If you are a magus, you should be able to feel my magical energy."

"Hm."
I see, so it's Saber's finger that's touching me.
I pull myself together and calm down.

Then.
What is this?

"Saber, what was that?"
"You should not need to ask. You and I are connected by our contract, so it is only natural for you to be able to understand my status."

"Understand? You mean, what happened just now?"
"I do not know how you saw it. It is your standard that measures the Servant's ability. Some Masters classify according to color, and some classify according to animals."

"So in other words, you perceive it in a way most comprehensible for you.
 This is a standard concept for a Master, so please check frequently. Like me, once you see someone, you shall understand their details."

...I see.
I was a bit surprised since it was so sudden, but I might be able to act a bit like a Master now.
This is a story from a winter five years ago.

It was a night with a beautiful moon.
I wasn't doing anything, just watching the moon with Kiritsugu.
Even though it was winter, the air wasn't cold.
The corridor was a little chilly, but it was a good night to enjoy the moon.

Back then, Kiritsugu didn't leave the house often.
Not going outside, he would just laze around the house carelessly.
...I regret it even now, thinking back to it.
Why didn't I notice that it was like the actions of an animal that knows its time of death?

"I wanted to be a superhero when I was a child."
Suddenly.
That man, himself a superhero in my child's eyes, said that as if yearning for it.

"What? What do you mean by 'wanted'? Did you give up?"
I became angry and asked him.
Kiritsugu laughed apologetically and looked up at the sky.

"Yes, unfortunately. Being a hero is a time-limited thing, and it becomes hard to call yourself that when you grow up. I wish I'd found that out earlier."
I agreed with that.
I didn't know why, but I thought it couldn't be wrong if Kiritsugu said it.

"I see. Then I guess it couldn't be helped."
"Yeah. It really couldn't be helped."
Kiritsugu answers.
So of course, my response was determined.

"Yeah, it can't be helped, so I'll take your place.
 It's impossible since you're an adult, but it should be all right for me. Let me take on your dream."

"I'll make it come true."

Before I could finish, my father laughed.
He made a face like he didn't even need to hear the rest.
After breathing in, Emiya Kiritsugu said...
"YeahI'm relieved."
He quietly closed his eyes and ended his life.

I did not cry because he looked so calm, as if he would wake up the next morning.
It must also have to do with the fact that I'm used to seeing death.
I just silently looked up at the winter moon and my sleeping father.

There were no sounds of insects in the garden. All was silent.
In the bright night, I remember only my eyes burning.
I did not cry out, nor did I feel sad.
But I could not stop my tears until the moon sank.

That is the story from a winter five years ago.
Perhaps I cried ten years worth of tears, since after that, there was nothing.

Fuji-Nee's father planned the funeral, and I started living in this house by myself.
Even though Kiritsugu was gone, nothing changed.
Emiya Shirou would become a superhero like Emiya Kiritsugu, so there was no time to be playing around.

Yes.
I never said it, but I clearly remember it.
The figure of the man who saved a lone boy from an inferno.
Emiya Kiritsugu held up the dying child and said "thank you".

Since then, he was the subject of my admiration.
No one saved me.
I couldn't save anyone.
In it all, I was saved, and a person was there to save me.
That's why I decided to become like him.

Become a superhero, so that I could save people and let no one be killed... just like him.
Kiritsugu died peacefully, leaving me his dream of becoming a superhero himself.

It's only natural for a child to succeed his father.
Emiya Shirou must become a superhero and save someone just like the old me.

I swore that oath as a child.
To fulfill the dream of the man I admired most.

...But honestly, I don't get it.
What this superhero thing is supposed to be, how to become one, how to make everyone happy like Kiritsugu always said... and I became this thing called a Master and things like the blond-haired girl following me around is confusing my head and really

"......!"
When I open my eyes, I'm in a familiar room.
"What, I'm in my own room?"
As soon as I speak, I start to feel terribly sick.
"...Ugh... it tastes bad... in my mouth..."
I taste blood.
Maybe it was filling my mouth, but I breathe in thick air.


I'm not sure why I feel like this.
I feel really sick to my stomach, so I want to go to the bathroom and wash my face.

"All right."
I get up.
I feel dizzy.
I almost fall and support myself by putting a hand against the wall.
"...Ugh."
The nausea increases when I move.
...No, this is more like pain than nausea.

My body is heavy and it feels like my stomach is turning every time I move. Maybe someone would feel like this if they had burning lead poured into their stomach.
"...Ugh... Imagining that gives me a headache."
I wipe the sweat off my forehead and wobble out of my room.

"...All right. I feel better now."
I wash my face and wipe the sweat off my body.
"...?"
There are bandages wrapped around my stomach for some reason.
I can't recall anything about them, so I leave them be for now.

"...I'm hungry. I wonder if there are any leftovers..."
Even though my stomach feels terrible, it seems my body wants energy.

"Guh..."
Putting my mind into it, I start to walk along the wall.
I still feel dizzy, and my body feels dull.
"OwOwww"
I walk forward, crying out miserably.
...Really, what did I do before going to bed?
I don't remember any training that could have caused this pain.

I reach the living room.
Sakura and Fuji-Nee must be at school.
There's no breakfast prepared in the living room, and there's none of Fuji-Nee's loudness.
The living room is quiet, like an ordinary Sunday
"Good morning. I'm afraid I came in without asking you, Emiya-kun."
No, it's not.

"Wha!?"
Tohsaka Rin is sitting on a cushion.
Her calmness makes me think I'm the guest in this house and not her.
Yeah, that's why I'm even more surprised.

"......"
I don't know how to answer her, so I sit down.
And then, I take a deep breath and ask, 
"Tohsaka, why..."
"Hold on. Could you apologize first? I can't calm down until I hear an apology for last night."
I don't even have time to ask her why she's here.

Tohsaka is glaring at me like she's really mad.
It seems she's really angry about last night, but what happened?

"Hold on."
I recall it now.
That's right, why am I so relaxed?
I tried to save Saber and... Berserker blew away my stomach.

"...Ugh."
The nausea returns.
I feel a chill, remembering the feeling of having a hole in my body.
Something in my stomach moves.
It makes me feel sick.
It makes me feel sick, but that proves I'm still alive.

Wait, that's weird.
Shouldn't that have been instant death for me?

"That's strange. Why the hell am I alive?"
"Do you remember? The stupid thing you did last night? If you do, then please reflect upon your actions."

Tohsaka lets out a "hmph" as she scolds me.
...Huh, that's really annoying.
My head, which was frozen by the fact that Tohsaka is here, finally resumes activity again.

"What are you saying? There was nothing else to do at the time! Oh... well, it does look stupid if you just look at the results, but I was going to do it better.
 So it wasn't a mistake."
I protest, glaring at her.

"...Hmph."
W-What?
Why is she sighing?

"Didn't I tell you Servants disappear if their Master is killed? It's crazy to try to protect your Servant."

"Look, Saber will disappear if you're killed. If you want to save Saber, think of a way to do so from a safe place.
 ...Geez, don't you understand that protecting your Servant with your life is just meaningless?"

"It's not that I protected her with my life. I tried to save her, and it just happened to work out like that. I didn't think things would end up like that either."
I did think I would be killed if I went near that monster, but that's a different matter.

"...I see. You seem to be misunderstanding."
As if she's read my mind, she sulks even more.

"Look, Emiya-kun. I'll come out and say it.  I didn't take you to the church to help you win.
 I was trying to help you stay alive even if you were left on your own. It seems you didn't understand that part of it."

"Help me stay alive...?"
"That's right. You shouldn't take risks if you realize that a loss equals your death. You seem to be someone who would walk out at night by yourself even in a situation like this. 
 If I threatened you, I thought you wouldn't take risks and you might get through this."

"I see. I didn't notice that."
So that's why she's complaining to me about not realizing that and running at Berserker.

"...? So why are you mad, Tohsaka? It shouldn't bother you if I'm the one that made the mistake."

"Of course it bothers me! You made me worry for a whole night!"

Tohsaka loses her temper.
...But I see.
Honestly, I'm happy she's worrying about me.
Looking at the situation, it seems Tohsaka was the one who treated my injuries.

"I see. I guess you helped me out. Thank you."
I bow my head to show my thanks and apologize.


"Heh, if you undersand, then we'll let it slide. If you've learned from this, then think before acting next time."

Tohsaka looks away.
Her gesture is snappy, but it seems she's in a good mood again.

"Then we're done with what happened last night.
 I'll move on to the main topic, but which do you want to talk about? Last night or something serious?"

"...?"
Tohsaka starts a conversation as if it's natural to do so.
Her straight-forwardness surprises me, but thinking about it, she came here for a reason.

If she didn't have business with me, she would have gone home already.
What is it that Tohsaka, my enemy, wants to discuss in her enemy's territory?

I'm interested in that, and I also want to know what happened last night.
It's stupid not to ask, so I

"I want to know what happened yesterday first."
"That's right. Knowing the current situation comes first. Wow, you're pretty smart."
Smiling in satisfaction, Tohsaka describes yesterday's events.

It seems that Berserker left after I lost consciousness.
She tells me that my body started to heal itself, and that it looked fine after about ten minutes.
And she says she brought me here since I didn't regain consciousness even after my wound healed, and that's where we are right now.

"The important thing is you survived on your own. I did help, but it was your own power that healed you. Don't mistake that part."
"It seems that way from what you told me. So you didn't heal it?"

"Of course not. I can't do anything like revive a dying person any more. Emiya Shirou himself healed his own wounds."

"Hm."
What can I do, now that she said that?
My stomach is certainly healed, but I have doubts about Tohsaka's story.
I can't use healing magic, let alone revival magic.

"Then the cause must be the Servant.
 Your Servant must be really powerful, or something went wrong during the summoning. ...Well, I think it's both, but I think some kind of line formed between you two."

"A line? You mean like the karmic line connecting a familiar and a magus?"

"Oh, so you have a working knowledge of familiars?
 Then this should be easy to explain. In other words, Emiya-kun and Saber's relationship is not a normal relationship like the one between a normal master and their familiar.

"It looks like Saber has natural healing powers, so some of that may be flowing into you.
 Normally, the magus's power flows into the familiar, but in your case, the familiar's power is flowing into you and helping you out."

"...Hmmm. So putting it simply, it's like a river flowing upstream?"
"That's a good way to put it. It is not naturally possible, but I bet Saber's magical energy is so great that it can even change the flow of a river. That's the only reason she is able to go against Berserker with her small size."

"Not naturally possible... then is the relationship between you and Archer that of a normal magus and familiar?"
"Yes. He doesn't listen to much of what I say, but we do still have such a relationship."

"The connection between a Servant and a Master is like that of gasoline and an engine. We provide the magical energy, and the Servant uses it.
 ......Well, I guess there have been some Masters who shared their physical bodies with their Servants to obtain false immortality. Not dying until their Servants are dead, something like that... hey, are you listening, Emiya-kun?"

"Huh...? Yeah, I'm listening.
 Then, are you saying most wounds on my body will heal even if I don't do anything?"

"Using your Servant's magical energy. I don't know how, but I'm sure the cause is in Saber's materialization. I know you haven't learned the curse of self-healing."
"Of course not. My father never taught me anything that difficult."

"No, I mean that if that's the case, I've nothing to worry about. Don't worry about it, it has nothing to do with you."

"...?"
What is it?
Tohsaka's words are indirect and hard to follow.

"Oh well. Just don't do anything too reckless.
 It's good that you survived this time, but you won't survive if you get hurt like that again. You shouldn't get optimistic and think that you'll survive any major injury."

"I understand. I feel bad about getting hurt and having Saber helping me."

"Idiot, that's not the reason. I'm sure you're not just using Saber's magical energy to heal your wounds.
 You're definitely using something.
 I don't know what it is... your life span, your luck, or your savings account, but you're definitely using something up."
Tohsaka gives a "hmph" once again.
I feel the same way, but...

"Tohsaka, isn't my savings account completely unrelated?"
"Of course it's related! Magic uses up your money, so it's something that drains your money the more you use it!
 I won't allow myself to be wrong!"
Tohsaka Rin erupts with the fire of a personal grudge.

It's strange.
The more I talk with her, the more I understand this is the real Tohsaka Rin, and that the Tohsaka at school is just a mask she puts on.
...No, it's something I realized already yesterday.

"Well, putting the part about money aside.
 Is it okay if I ask you a serious question, Emiya-kun?"
"That's why you stayed here, right? All right, I'll listen."

"Then I'll be direct about it. What are you planning to do from now on?"
She confronts me with the one question I don't want to be asked.

...No, that's not it.
It's not that I don't want her to ask me, but I haven't made my mind up yet.
I'm the one who wants to ask what I should do now.

"...Honestly, I don't know. You say I should fight for the Holy Grail, but I've never been in a fight between magi.
 First of all, I"
I want to try to avoid killing people, and most of all

"I'm not interested in something mysterious like the Holy Grail.
 I'm not too sure about risking my life for something I don't want."
"I knew you'd say that. You'll be killed by your Servant with an attitude like that."

"Wha... Why would I!?"
"Because the Servant's goal is also the Holy Grail.
 They can be summoned by the Masters because obtaining the Holy Grail is a condition of their summoning."

"The most important thing for a Servant is to obtain the Holy Grail.
 They obey their Master and risk their life for their Master, because they have a chance of obtaining it.
 So just try saying that you don't want the Holy Grail. You can't complain even if they kill you and call you a traitor."

"...What?  That's weird.  Servants are summoned by the Masters, right?
 So"

"Do you think a Servant would obey a human without being rewarded? 
 The Holy Grail grants the wish of whoever obtains it. The Servant of the Master who obtains it is no exception.
 Even Servants have their own wishes. That is why they respond to the otherwise impossible summoning."

"It's not that Masters summon Servants to obtain the Holy Grail.
 Servants answer the Masters' call so they can obtain it."


Servants have their own desires...?
Then, does that mean Saber has a wish she wants the Holy Grail to grant?

"That's why the Servants try to eliminate other Servants even without orders from their Masters. Only one can obtain the Holy Grail. They cannot accept other Masters obtaining it.
 Unlike their Masters, they don't have the power to take away the Command Spells. So the only way they can disarm other Masters is to kill them."

"So even if the Master has no intention of fighting, battle is inevitable.
 A Master who is attacked by a Servant must fight it off with their own Servant. You heard enough from Kirei to know that this is the nature of the Holy Grail War, right?"

"Yeah, he told me that last night.
 But"

That means allowing your Servant to try to kill other Servants.
I thought it would be over if I reached a compromise with other Masters, but if Servants are summoned to obtain the Holy Grail and they will not give it up, then a battle between the Servants is inevitable.
...Then...
The girl who fought to protect me is also ready to kill or be killed to obtain the Holy Grail?

"...That's awful. I don't know about this heroic spirit thing, but Saber is human. She was bleeding badly yesterday too."
"Oh, don't worry about that. There's no life or death for Servants. Even if Servants are eliminated, they just go back to where they belong. Heroic spirits are a phenomenon, they can't be killed. The only ones that can be killed during a fight are Masters."

"No, but still..."
Even if it's a temporary death...
There's still the fact that something human-like has disappeared from this world.

"What? Are you saying it's murder? Are you still carrying such a sense of justice even though you're a magus?"


Her comment is only natural.
As a magus, death is always right beside me.
I understand it and I'm already prepared for that.
But stillI'm not strong enough to judge people's deaths as good or bad.

"Of course. I won't fight anyone to the death."
"Oh? So you're just going to wait for the others to kill you? You're ceding the victory to other Masters?"

"That's not it. The point is to survive to the end, right? I don't have any intention of killing others, but I'll have no mercy in a fight to protect myself.
 ...If the enemies are out to kill me, they can't complain if they are killed in return, right?"

"Oh, so you'll be staying on the defensive. Then you'll just be observing what other Masters are doing, right? So even if someone like yesterday goes around killing everyone, you're going to ignore it?"

Someone like yesterday...?
She must mean that inhuman monster.

Superhuman strength that allows the destruction of a house or two with a single blow...
...Certainly, if that thing wished it, this town could be in ruins in just one night.

And on top of that, the problem is that the Servants are normally in spirit form.
Humans can't see those in spirit form.
But since the Servants can affect the real world as spirits, you could call them the most powerful weapon.
With the technology we have now, there are no weapons that can affect spiritual beings.

Our attacks are useless against them, while theirs can still harm us.
It's more than just an unfair game.
Murder by a Servant is like natural death for normal people.
Death caused by an invisible killer will just be treated as an accident or suicide.

"What is that? Servantsno, Masters and Servants don't just attack other Masters? Don't other people have nothing to do with them?"
"Yeah, I really wish that was the case. But if it were, you wouldn't need a supervisor like Kirei, would you?"

"I should have said earlier. Servants are spirits. They are already complete, so they don't grow.
 But magical energy used as fuel is different.
 The more they have available, the more they can use the powers they had in life.
 In that respect, they're just like us magi... Do you understand?"

"I do. So they can use magic repeatedly, right?"

You could say magical energy is the gunpowder to fill a gun, and the magus is the gun itself.
The type of gun depends on the abilities of the magus: pistol, rifle, machine gun, shotgun...
Continuing with that metaphor, Servants are cannons.
Using a large amount of gunpowder, they fire a large bullet.

"That's right. Servants aren't given their mana by nature. They act with the magical energy inside them.
 We Masters support them, so Servants can only use their powers using their own magical energy plus the magical energy of their Masters.

"But that means an amateur Master like you would be no match for other Masters, right?
 So there's a loophole... well, I guess you could call it an obvious answer. Servants can supplement their magical energy from other sources.
 Servants are spirits, so they can get nourishment from eating things that are like them."

"Hm?"
Nourished by eating things that are like them...?
"Things like them? You mean other spirits? But what kind of spirits would they eat?"

"It's a simple answer. Nature spirits obtain power from nature itself.
So where do you think Servants, human spirits, get their power from?"
"Oh."
It is a simple answer.
Just as we humans eat meat, the human spirits

"Exactly. Usually, they replenish enough magical energy from their Masters.
 But it's obvious that one gets more magical energy from many people than from just one person, right?
 So, to put it bluntly, a weak Master makes his Servant eat humans."


"Servants transform human emotions and souls into magical energy.
 That is the most efficient way to make your Servant more powerful. There are many Masters who kill humans as sacrifices for their Servants."

"As sacrifices... so you're saying that if a Master didn't care about his methods, he would kill humans to make his Servant stronger?"
"Yes. But I don't think a smart Master would do such a thing."

"You see, even if Servants are powerful, there is a limit to their magical energy capacity. They can't store magical energy beyond it, so there is a limit to how much they can kill to collect magical energy. 
 The Association wouldn't ignore you if you went around killing people, and most of all, other Masters might figure out your Servant's abilities and identify them from the cause of death. Not to mention the identity of the Master as well.
 It is highly advantageous in the Holy Grail War to keep your identity a secret, so most Masters should use their Servants sparingly."

...I see.
Certainly, if nobody knows that you are a Master, there's no danger of other Masters attacking you.
Conversely, if you know who the other Masters are, you could definitely pull a surprise attack on them.
By that theory, there won't be many Masters that would have their Servants attack humans and reveal their identity

"...I'm glad. Then there's no problem. That means Servants won't indiscriminately attack humans without orders from their Master."

"Right. They are heroes, right? Someone who would go out and kill people wouldn't be called a hero in the first placewell, no, I can't really say that for sure.
 There are many examples of people becoming heroes just because they were mass murderers."


Tohsaka makes an ominous comment.
As it seems to be her true feelings rather than just sarcasm, a bit of strain in her personality might be showing.

"Let's get back to the point. What are you going to do?
 Since you don't want to kill people, you're just going to watch, is that right?"

...I take back what I said.
She really has a bad personality. She's a real bully, putting me on the spot and asking me that with a smile.

"I'll just have to stop them. The Masters will calm down once they lose their Servants, right?"
"Unbelievable. You say you won't go out and kill other Masters, but you also say you'll kill them if they do anything bad.
 Emiya-kun, do you realize you're contradicting yourself?"

"Yeah, I know it's selfish, but I can't think of any other choices. I won't change my decision no matter how much you argue against it."

"Hmm. But there's one problem with that. Would you like to know what it is?"
She's plotting something. With that face, she's definitely plotting something.
But as a man, I have to listen.

"O-Okay. What is it?"
"Do you remember the Master yesterday? The girl who was talking about killing you and me?"

How could I forget?  They attacked us mercilessly.

"That girl will come to kill us. I think you know that too."

I... see.
That girl is a Master too.

Since she knows Tohsaka and I are Masters, she will come and attack us sooner or later.
I don't know if it'll be today or tomorrow, but I do know it's a death sentence.
At least, I know I can't stop such a monster.

"Her Servant, Berserker, is on a different level.
 You can't match it, being an inexperienced Master. You say you won't do anything except defend yourself, but you won't even be able to do that."

"Sorry. But you wouldn't be able to beat it either, right?"

"I wouldn't be able to beat it head on. It's the most powerful Servant in hand-to-hand combat. I don't think any previous Servant could match it. Even I wouldn't be able to escape if Berserker attacked me."

"...I feel the same way. I don't think I'll get another chance if they attack me again."

Unconsciously, I place my hand on my stomach.
The wound on my stomach is healed now.
No, you couldn't call it a wound. It was pretty much instant death.
My nausea returns just at the thought of taking another blow like that.

"That's right. Do you get it? You can't choose to wait until the Holy Grail War is over without doing anything."

"...Yeah, I get it. But what are you trying to say? I don't quite understand.
 Or are you enjoying watching me be condemned to death?"

"I don't have such bad taste.
 Geez, don't you get it after I've said so much? In short, I'm asking you if you want to join up with me."

"...?"
Hm? Hmmmm, hm?
Um, if I take that at face value, that's...

"Join up!? You mean, me and you!?"
"Yes. My Archer received a fatal wound and is healing right now. It will take a while for him to heal fully, but he should still be about half as useful.
 And there are no problems with your Servant, but her Master is dragging her down, so she is half as useful as well. See, it adds up fine."

"Huh. I'm not that bad."
"Even though you've almost died three times from what I know of? I think you're the first person I've ever seen almost die three times in one day."

"Guhbut that's..."
"I'll make the alliance worthwhile. I'll forgive you for beating Archer and I'll teach you about being a Master. Oh, and if we have time, I can look at your skills as a magus. How about it?"

...Ugh.
That certainly is an attractive proposal.
As I don't know anything, Tohsaka would be a useful teacher.

And if I can help it, I don't want to fight against her.
Not because she's the girl I admired at school.
In fact, if I didn't know her like this, I wouldn't feel this much resistance.

...The Tohsaka Rin in front of me is so different from how people describe her as an honor student.
But talking to her, she is just Tohsaka and it seems she's just as she appears.
Wellin other words, I'm saying I find her so much more attractive this way that I'm wondering why I even have to tell myself this

"Emiya-kun? I want to hear your answer."
She urges me to respond.
I

I go up the stairs.
Leaving Saber to watch the house, I end up at school, but I'm still a little gloomy.

"...Emiya-kun!?"
"Oh."
She's here.
The one person I can discuss anything with appears out of nowhere. It's almost too good to be true.

"I see.
 You must think I'm soft."
She must have something to tell me as well, since she stops and talks to me.

How fortunate for me!
I'll
"Fine. If that's how you want it, we'll settle things here and now. I can't believe you came to school without your Servant"
"Sorry! I'm begging you! Please let me talk to you!"
I close in on Tohsaka and push her against the wall.
I can't let the other students hear this.

"H-Hey, what are you thinking...!? I didn't mean that, and there are people here...!"

"Please, you're the only one I can depend on. Sakura might get involved in the Holy Grail War, and I don't know what to do. You know a lot, so tell me, is there a way to protect Sakura without telling her anything!?"


Tohsaka stares at me in complete surprise.
"Oh... I-I'm sorry. I got flustered because the timing of you being here was perfect.
 ...Um, Sakura is my underclassman. She might get involved in the Holy Grail War, and I don't want that. But I can't come up with any good ideas, so..."

"I don't care about your excuses. Can you just let go of me?
 Homeroom is going to start."
"...! O-Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't notice...!"

I quickly let go of Tohsaka.
...I feel my face burning.
What was I thinking, pushing Tohsaka up against the wall like that...!?

"I'm sorry. I know I'm apologizing a lot, but please hear me out. I"
"...You want to ask me something, right? All right, I'll listen."
"What? R-Really!?"

"...Hey now. You look like you're going to die if I don't listen to you. Come up to the rooftop during lunchtime. I'll listen then."
Tohsaka turns and goes up the stairs.

As I look up at her in blank amazement...
"You idiot. You'll be late if you don't hurry."
...Tohsaka leaves with those words.
Tohsaka is the only one I can consult with about Shinji.
No, the real problem is the bruise Sakura had this morning, but that problem involves Shinji as well

"Fine. If that's how you want it, we'll settle things here and now. I can't believe you came to school without your Servant"
"Sorry! I'm begging you! Please let me talk to you!"

I close in on Tohsaka and push her against the wall.
I can't let the other students hear this.

"H-Hey, what are you thinking...!? I didn't mean that, and there are people here...!"

"Please, you're the only one I can depend on. Sakura might get involved in the Holy Grail War, and I don't know what to do. You know a lot, so tell me, is there a way to protect her without telling her anything!?"


Tohsaka stares at me in complete surprise.
"Oh... I-I'm sorry. I got flustered because the timing of you being here was perfect.
 ...Um, Sakura is my underclassman. She might get involved in the Holy Grail War, and I don't want that. But I can't come up with any good ideas, so..."

"I don't care about your excuses. Can you just let go of me?
 Homeroom is going to start."
"...! O-Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't notice...!"

I quickly let go of Tohsaka.
...My face starts turning red.
What was I thinking, pushing Tohsaka up against the wall like that...!?

"I'm sorry. I know I'm apologizing a lot, but please hear me out. I"
"...You want to ask me something, right? All right, I'll listen."
"What? R-Really!?"
"...Hey now. You look like you're going to die if I don't listen to you. Come up to the rooftop during lunchtime. I'll listen then."
Tohsaka turns and goes up the stairs.

As I look up at her in blank amazement...
"You idiot. You'll be late if you don't hurry."
...Tohsaka leaves with those words.
I'll run away.
I mean, I should hurry to my classroom.
Consulting Tohsaka seemed like a good idea, but...

The school's number one honor student exudes the aura of a cat about to pounce on her prey and tear it apart.
Discretion is the better part of valor.

"Good morning, Tohsaka. Goodbye, Tohsaka."
I sprint up the stairs.

"H-Hold on, I'm not done yet...!"
I ignore her and run into the hallway.
...I think I'm making things worse, but there's nothing more dangerous than talking to her right now.

I made it.
It's three minutes before homeroom starts, and Fuji-Nee isn't here yet.

Shinji's desk is empty.
It'd hard to face him after what happened yesterday, but I wanted to settle things.
But I can't do anything if he's not here.
Going to Shinji's house will only provoke him, so I have to come up with a way that won't involve Sakura.

"...Huh?"
There's another empty desk.
That's Issei's desk.
"That's rare. So even Issei can be absent, huh?"
I set my bag down and prepare for homeroom.

"Sorry to keep you all waiting! Isn't this a new record!?"
Fuji-Nee arriving before the bell rings is a rare spectacle indeed.

...I'm relieved.
I thought she slept in since she didn't come to my house this morning, but she's more energetic than usual.

"It's lunchtime! Let's go eat some meat at the cafeteria!"
Someone screams in joy the moment the lunch bell rings.
Only the guys would say something like that, and the girls move their desks to the corner as if to distance themselves.

"Oh, I'm eating at the cafeteria today too. I'll go with you, Saitama."
"I'll pass. I ate some meat yesterday."
"We'll pass as well... Please give it up already, guys. We're tired of the food there."

"What!? The B meal at our cafeteria is the best! The croquette tastes just like meat!"
"Well, that might be enough for you, but I don't like how the vegetables taste like meat as well."

"What about you, Emiya? The amount of people who go to the cafeteria depends on if you brought your lunch or not. Make some lunch for me sometime, will you?"
"Hey, that's no fair! Come over here, Emiya-kun. Let's trade your stuff for our sandwiches."

"Come on, you only got that at the convenience store! You're a girl and you didn't put effort into cooking!? You don't deserve our lunches! You have to make omelets if you want some of our good food!"
"Hey, that's rude! I can make an omelet. You just pour water on it and heat it up. Isn't that right, Emiya-kun?"

"......No, that's wrong.
 You guys have it all wrong. And I didn't bring my lunch today. I won't have time to make lunch, so I'll be eating at the cafeteria until finals."

Whaaaaaaaat!!?

The people that didn't bring their lunch all pout in unison.
My classmates are in harmony only at times like these.

The guys come back, arguing if fried shrimp that tastes like meat is a good thing or a bad thing.

It's almost fifth period. I should sit down and get ready

"...What is this?"
I find a strange piece of paper in my desk.


...I'm at a loss for words.
She must have disguised her handwriting, just in case.

"Tohsaka."
...It has to be her.
She's the only one that would know about "this morning".
"......"
I want to pretend I didn't see this letter, but the last line really catches my attention.

"...She must know I can see the words she scribbled out... Or maybe not."
...I really don't want to, but it's great to have a chance to talk to her.
I don't know what to do about Sakura, so I'll consult Tohsaka about it

With the end of sixth period, school is over.
It's time.
I don't know what Tohsaka intends to do, but there are students staying in the building.
The archery club should be practicing until five, so I can take cover there if something happens.
Tohsaka is a legitimate magus, so she shouldn't attack me in front of people.

Miyama City is located in a valley between mountains.
There are hills all over town, and there are roads that lead up to small mountains.

And this school is on one of them.
The back of the school isn't landscaped at all.
Instead, it is woodland that stretches across the back of the school.

So.
In this place, where even the athletic clubs never enter...
...A furious demon awaits me.

"......"
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I ought to go home.
But I'll be killed for sure if I turn my back to her.
I bet she'll mercilessly shower me with her magic.

"Um, I'm here, Tohsaka. What's up?"
I call out to her from the edge of the woods.
I really can't go in any further.
There would be less chance of survival if I did go into the woods.

"Hey, Tohsaka! Do you not hear me!?"
I yell out to her.
My voice echoes through the woods.

"I hear you! Don't shout

 my name so loudly!!"
Her voice comes ringing back.
She yells at me after she rushes in at me.
Her voice echoes even longer than mine.

"...Wow, that's amazing, Tohsaka. I bet they heard you in the archery range."
"Oh... Crap, you got me carried away again."
Gritting her teeth, Tohsaka backs up a step.

"Heh. It's fine, this is expected. I knew you would show up defenseless."
So...
I don't know what the deal is, but she seems to be getting angrier as we talk.

"...? What are you so mad about? Was it that embarrassing to scream out like that?"
"I-I wouldn't get mad about something as trivial as that.
 What's irritating me is your harmfulness that's taken as harmless."

She glares at me.
I guess I should be nervous about being alone with her, but because of where we are, I don't panic.

"...? What do you mean by that? Are you saying I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing?"
"That's just imitation. You may be a sheep, but you are so mutated you could kill a wolf."

"...???"
I'm even more confused.
Actually... isn't a mutated sheep not a sheep anymore?

"Oh well. We don't have time to waste on chatter.  Let's get to the point. I'm glad you didn't run away, Emiya-kun."
"Of course not. I can't ignore such threats. Those words themselves even felt cursed."

"Huh?"
Then...
Tohsaka freezes once again.

"Wait, what do you mean by threats?"
"It's this."
I show her the piece of paper that was in my desk.

"Geez, don't scare me like that. I thought someone other than me lured you out here."

"You're really hasty. It's true that I was irritated, but I won't curse a memo. That's just a normal message
 ...Hey, why are you frowning like that?"

"......"
My expression is only natural.
Tohsaka honestly thinks that it's an ordinary memo.
Well, it doesn't really matter what she thinks of it, but the image in my head of Tohsaka Rin crumbles to dust.

"...Uh... Could it be that I unconsciously cursed it with my Gandr...?"
"Huh? No, the letter itself was normal. But this is a threat, no matter how you look at it.  Any other student would've told the teacher right away."

"I-I couldn't help it. I didn't have time, and it's not like I could write you a formal letter. So that's all I could do."

"Okay. ...But you didn't have to change your handwriting. And the last line was really scary."

"That's your fault as well.
 You ran away this morning, so I thought I had to write something extra to make you come here. I was being considerate when I put some emotion into it."

"Heh, fine. I don't care if you think it's a threat.  You're here, and that's what matters."

She looks away angrily.
...Well, I'm glad Tohsaka knew that the memo sounded like a threat.

"Fine. So, what do you want, Tohsaka? Calling me out to a place like this... do you want to fight me?"

"If you want. But don't get me wrong. I'm not attacking you because Archer is healing his wounds. I would've taken your Command Spell this morning if he wasn't wounded.
 ...I really wanted to when I saw you walking around this morning, after I've told you so many times not to act carelessly."


I'm stunned.
So, Tohsaka is angry about...
"...? So you were worried about me, Tohsaka?"
...I don't know why, but is that the case?

"T-That's not true! I wanted to talk to you because I was concerned about what happened this morning.
 You were about to say something, right? I was worried, so I decided to hear you out."



I'm even more surprised.
I never thought Tohsaka would insist that I consult her.

"Why are you so quiet? ...It's all right, I won't force it out of you if you don't want to talk about it. I'm not angry now, so I'll go home if you have nothing to say."

"Ohhold on, Tohsaka.
 I do have something I want to ask you. No, I really do need to consult you."

"Then tell me. I can keep any secret, and I'll help you if I can."

"Yeah, thanks.
 ...Um, this has nothing to do with you, but there's this girl called Matou Sakura.
 She's a year below me, and I've known her for a long time. Her older brother is Matou Shinji, and I've known him for a long time as well.
 To put it simply, I fought a Master last night, and that Master was Shinji."

"...Matou Shinji was a Master...?"
"Yeah. I'm sure of it because his grandfather, Matou Zouken, told us. I heard that the Matou family is a family of magidid you know about that, Tohsaka?"

"Of course. The only magus in this town that I didn't know about is you. But I never thought it was possible. Because Shinji is..."

"He's not a magus. He doesn't have a Magic Circuit, right? That's what Matou Zouken said.
 ...But that's a condition to be a magus.
 I think the conditions for becoming a Master are different. I'm like Shinji. You shouldn't assume that only magi can become Masters."

"......I see. So, what about Shinji? Did you defeat him?"
"Yeah. Saber defeated his Servant, Rider. His book, his Command Spell, burned up, so he isn't a Master anymore.
 ...But I don't think he's given up. That alone is dangerous, but on top of that, Sakura has to live with him."

"I heard from Zouken that magic only gets taught to the successor. Sakura was raised without being taught anything, so she doesn't know what Shinji is doing.
 As long as she doesn't find out, she won't get involved in this war between the Masters."

"......You're right. So why do you think Sakura is in danger?"
"I told you that Shinji is dangerous right now. He might take out his anger on Sakura, and who knows what'll happen if he does something even worse.
 So, um..."

"So you want to end it before Shinji involves Sakura? Your idea is good, but it's not possible. Just look at the Ryudou Temple. The other Masters are tricky. I think this Holy Grail War will last longer than expected."


...I see.
The best outcome would be for Shinji to give up, but that's not realistic.
The only option is to separate Sakura from Shinji

"Then there's only one possible solution. If you don't want to involve Sakura, you have to put her under your protection."
"I thought about that, but I'm a Master too.
 It's too dangerous to have her at my place, and Shinji will never stand for it.  Besides, I doubt she wants to stay at my house."

"...Geez. You really are dense, Emiya-kun."
"Huh?"

"Never mind. Just go ahead and ask her. Protecting Sakura from Shinji and protecting her from other Masters are one and the same.
 Shouldn't you choose the option that lets you do something? ...Um, if this Sakura person is someone important to you."


Tohsaka's words hit me hard.
It feels like she smacked me upside the head.
"You're right. You're absolutely right. I should ask her before I start worrying about what I think."
"......"

"Thanks, Tohsaka. I'll try to convince Sakura once I get home... Hey, why are you quiet all of a sudden?"

"Nothing. I'm quiet because this is nothing you have to thank me for.
 But I owe you one now. I didn't think you'd tell me that Shinji was a Master.
 I guess I have to show you one of my cards as well."

"What? One of your cards...?"
"I have to give you information. The information that Shinji was a Master helps me out, so I'll give you some information I have as well.
 You know about the people who have gone into comas around town, right?
 That's a Servant's doing, and the Master is at the Ryudou Temple."

"...!? Oh, you were saying something about the Ryudou Temple earlier. ...Wait, that Ryudou Temple?"

"Yes. They're cunning enemies, so watch out if you're planning on attacking them. They aren't taking lives, but they are attacking indiscriminately.
 Since they're getting stronger by the day, I want to beat them as soon as possible, but the wound Archer suffered hasn't healed yet.
 Well, I'm going to sit and watch for a while since they can only use a set amount of magical energy at once, no matter how much magical energy they may store."


...A Master is at the Ryudou Temple.
Tohsaka is doing her best as a Master, even though her Servant isn't fully healed yet.

"That's all.
 Goodbye, Emiya-kun. You should go home quickly and comfort your precious underclassman."

"Hey, Tohsaka...!"
I stop Tohsaka, but she ignores me and walks to the archery range.

"...?"
...What was that?
Tohsaka was in a bad mood all this time, but something was different at the end there.

"Oh, it's time to leave... I certainly should go home quickly."
I hear the five o'clock bell.
The sun will set soon.
I need to get home and deal with the Sakura issue.
I hurry to my classroom.
It's three minutes before homeroom starts, and Fuji-Nee isn't here yet.
Shinji's desk is empty.
It'd hard to face him after what happened yesterday, but I wanted to settle things.
But I can't do anything if he's absent.
Going to Shinji's house will only provoke him, so I have to come up with a way that won't involve Sakura.

"...Huh?"
There's another empty desk.
That's Issei's desk.
"That's rare. So even Issei can be absent, huh?"
I set my bag down and prepare for homeroom.

"Sorry to keep you all waiting! Isn't this a new record!?"
Fuji-Nee arriving before the bell rings is a rare spectacle indeed.
Heh.
I thought she'd slept in since she didn't come to my house this morning, but she's even more energetic than usual.

The lunchtime bell rings.
I sprint out of the classroom, buy some bread and tea, and hurry up the stairs.

"Haa, haa, ha!"
I dash to the rooftop, startling students as I go.
My heart's beating fast.
It's been pounding faster and faster the whole day.

"...Haa, haa, ah"
To be honest, I'm nervous.
I'm glad that I can consult her, but that hardly seems to matter now.

I must've been crazy to make arrangements with Tohsaka Rin.
She's the school idol, the perfect honor student, the girl I've admired!

"Man, calm down, you idiot!"
I try to catch my breath as I run up the stairs.

...Anyway, this is a big event.
Tohsaka is Tohsaka even though she's a Master, so I can't be late.
And I'm asking her a favor.
So I have to get there before her and act cool.

But...
"T-Tohsaka?"
"You're late, Emiya-kun."
...It seems there's a line no ordinary person can cross.

"You want to talk to me about something, right? Let's sit down."
Without waiting for a reply, Tohsaka walks over to the water tower.
I see.
Nobody will see us there, and it'll block the wind.

"So, tell me what's on your mind. Who's this Sakura girl, and what happened yesterday?"
"Eho-okay. It's a bit long, but do you mind?"
"Try to make it short. Lunchtime isn't that long."

...!
Having her this close is just making me more nervous.
But now's not the time.
I have to ask her about Sakura.

"T-Then I'll try to make this simple.
 Matou Sakura is my underclassman, and I've known her for a long time.
 Her older brother is Matou Shinji, and I've known him for a long time as well.
 To put it simply, I fought a Master last night, and that Master was Shinji."
"...!? Matou Shinji was a Master!?"

"Yeah. I'm sure of it because his grandfather, Matou Zouken, told us. He also said that the Matou family is a family of magidid you know about that, Tohsaka?"

"Of course. The only magus in this town that I didn't know about was you. But I never thought it was possible. Because Shinji is..."

"He's not a magus. He doesn't have a Magic Circuit, right? That's what Matou Zouken said.
 ...But that's a condition to be a magus.
 I think the conditions for becoming a Master are different. I'm like Shinji in that respect. You shouldn't assume that only magi can become Masters."

"......I see. So, what about Shinji? Did you defeat him?"
"Yeah. Saber defeated his Servant, Rider. His book, his Command Spell, burned up, so he isn't a Master anymore.
 ...But I don't think he's given up. That alone is dangerous, but on top of that, Sakura is living at his house."

"I heard from Zouken that magic only gets taught to the successor. Sakura was raised without being taught anything, so she doesn't know what Shinji is doing.
 As long as she doesn't find out, she won't get involved in this war between the Masters."

"......You're right. So why do you think Sakura is in danger?"

"I told you that Shinji is dangerous right now. He might take out his anger on Sakura, and there's no telling what'll happen if he does something even worse.
 So, um..."

"So you want to end it before Shinji involves Sakura? Your idea is good, but it's not possible. Just look at the Ryudou Temple. The other Masters are tricky. I think this Holy Grail War will last longer than expected."


...I see.
The best outcome would be for Shinji to give up, but that's not realistic.
Then the only option is to separate Sakura from Shinji

"Then there's only one possible solution. If you don't want to involve Sakura, you have to put her under your protection."

"I thought about that, but I'm a Master too.

"...Geez. You really are dense, Emiya-kun."
"Huh?"

"It's nothing. Just go ahead and ask her. Protecting Sakura from Shinji and protecting her from other Masters are the same thing.
 Shouldn't you choose the option that lets you do something? ...Um, if this Sakura person is someone important to you."


Tohsaka's words hit me hard.
It feels like she smacked me in the head.
"You're right. You're absolutely right. I should ask her before I start worrying about what I think."

"That's right. First of all, nobody would go make meals for a person they hated. Sakura trusts you, so have a little confidence in yourself."

"...? Did I tell you that Sakura comes over to make meals for us?"

"...! Y-You did! You told me at the very beginning! You told me, you probably told me, you certainly told me! You told me, so don't worry about it!"
Her quick shout stops my rebuttal.

"......"
Oh well.
I've already learned that Tohsaka wears a mask at school.

"All right. Thanks, you really helped me out.
 I would've taken longer to make up my mind."

"Oh. You're pretty bold now. Are you showing off, telling me that you would've arrived at the same conclusion by yourself?"
Tohsaka smiles.


Her smile attacks me by surprise.
"Oh, that's not what I meant. But wouldn't you have Sakura stay over if she was still depressed tomorrow?"

"Oh, your face is all red. So you really can't lie, huh? You're acting cool, but you're actually innocent inside."

"...! Who are you to say that!? Is it fun to make fun of people when you're supposed to be an honor student!?"
"Hey now, I choose who I make fun of. I only make fun of people if it's worth doing."

"Come on. It's cold, so come closer and block the wind."
"...!!!!! Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-You idiot, it'll be terrible if we get any closer!! I'll take you on if you're picking a fight with me, so get away from me, you devil!!!"
I arc back and get my face away from Tohsaka.

!!
T-This is bad.
Having her close was bad enough, but just now was fatal.
After getting to know Tohsaka, the person I admired became a dangerous associate.

...That's fine by itself, but that was too much.
When she gets this close to me, I can't ignore her beautiful hair, her soft-looking body, her pretty face...

My heart's pounding so hard that it feels like it's about to explode.
...I hate to admit it, but she is beautiful.
Her true nature is different than what I thought, but I still admire her.

"A-Anyway, thanks for your help. That's all I have to say.
 I'll listen to you now."
"What? I don't have anything to talk about."
"Huh? Weren't you saying something this morning?
 ...Well, I wasn't listening because I was in a panic, but you looked like you were in a bad mood."

"Oh, that. It's fine now. It's true that I had business with you, but I don't feel like it now. I'm surprised, to be honest."
"...??? What do you mean, 'surprised'?"

"I mean that part of you.
 ...Oh well. I'll tell you one good thing while we're at it.
 You know about the people who've been going into comas around town, right?
 That's a Servant's doing, and the Master is at the Ryudou Temple."

"Oh, you were saying something about the Ryudou Temple earlier.
 ...Wait, that Ryudou Temple?"

"Yes. They're cunning enemies, so watch out if you're planning on attacking them. They aren't taking lives, but they are attacking indiscriminately.
 Well, I'm going to sit and watch for a while since they can only use a set amount of magical energy at once, no matter how much magical energy they may store."


...A Master is at the Ryudou Temple.
Tohsaka is doing her best, even though Archer isn't fully healed yet.

"Well, you owe me one, Emiya-kun.
 I told you something you didn't know."
The honor student smiles boldly.
I feel like a frog in front of a snake.

"W-What? I told you about Shinji too. That should make it even."
"Oh, that's been paid for with the advice about Sakura. Or what? You didn't mean those thanks you gave me?"

"Ugh"
S-She's a devil! She's a real devil! Don't let her fool you, everyone! The school's peace is in danger!

"Well, what should I take? Equivalent exchange is standard for magi."
Damn... I think my father said something like that as well.

"Hmmmmmm."
I look down at my hands.
This is the only thing I have right now.

"Do you get it now? You have no information to give me, so tell me Saber's true iden"
"...I guess I can't help it. You haven't eaten yet, right? I'll give you half of this."
I break my bread in half.
...Reluctantly, I give her the whole can of tea as a show of sincerity.

"Heywait, Emiya-kun?"
"Here, eat up. The cafeteria's closed by now. It should fill you up a bit."
I hand her the bread.


Does she not like it? She looks astonished, and...

"Thanks. Then I won't hold myself back."
...And, she really eats the bread without holding back.
School's over, and the commotion is dying down.
The students scatter to go to their clubs or head home.

"...All right. I have to go home and get ready."
Even if Sakura is going to stay over, I need to mentally prepare myself.
I should go buy groceries and wait for her to come after her club activities.

"Well. What should we have for dinner tonight?"
I stand in front of the supermarket and think.
Having Sakura stay over means convincing Fuji-Nee.
Then dinner should be something that they'll both enjoy

"...I already made a huge dinner yesterday. I'm not going to be working for a while and there's one more person to feed, so I shouldn't be spending money..."

But this month is an exception.
I have my savings, and I can't be distracted by money during the Holy Grail War.
And I should be repaying Sakura every chance I get.

"Phew..."
I leave the supermarket with bags full of food.
I think I bought too much, but it's all good.
I got some fresh codfish, so maybe I should make stew tonight.

"All right, anti-Fuji-Nee measure taken care of"
I stop walking.
"...?"
Someone's pulling at my shirt from behind.

"What's going on...?"
Still wondering, I turn around.
There...
...Stands a young girl with silver hair.

"W-What!?"
I quickly jump back.
I tense myself to act, but the girl just stands there and smiles.

"...?"
I don't feel any murderous intent or hostility from her.
"I'm glad you're alive, Onii-chan."
She looks at me with a big smile.

"Wha"
...I'm sure of it. This girl is Berserker's Master.
She controls the monster who nearly killed me.
The girl of the family of magi who started this war, the family which my father betrayed.
Why is she here in the shopping district during daytime?

She doesn't feel like a stranger at all... it must be because the priest's story was so vivid.
That's why...
"Ilya...?"
"Huh?"
...I blurt out her name without knowing what it means.

"Ohsorry, that's wrong...!
 Ilyayeah, it's Ilyasviel...!
 I-I'm sorry for getting it wrong...!"

I quickly apologize.
It doesn't matter if she's Berserker's Master or the daughter of the Einzbern family.
It's just that...
I can't leave her alone when her face looks so sad.

"......"
She's glaring at me, probably because I shortened her name.
"OhI didn't mean to make you mad. I just blurted it out."

"......Tell me your name."
"What?"
"Tell me your name, Onii-chan. It's unfair that I don't know your name."

Oh, she's right.
Ilyasviel told me her name, but I haven't told her mine yet.

"I'm Shirou. Emiya Shirou."
"Emiyashiro? That's a strange name, Onii-chan."
"No. Emiya is my last name, and Shirou is my first name. If it's hard to say it, just call me Shirou."
I correct her pronunciation.


I point right at her nose, and she stands there in surprise.


Even though I regret it, it's too late.
Looking like she's about to cry...

"...Shirou, Shirou, huh? Yeah, I like the name.
 It's simple, but it sounds pretty. It suits you, Shirou.
 I'll forgive you for what you just did!"
...She embraces my arm.

"What!? H-H-Hold on, Ilyasviel! What are you doing...!?"
"No, you can call me Ilya, Shirou! I'm calling you Shirou, so this is fair!"

"Whawell, that's easier to say, but hold on!!!"
I shake my arm, but Ilya only screams happily and enjoys it.

"...!"
This is bad. The neighbors might spread bad rumors about me if I keep this up.

"Damn, what do you want...!? Do you want to fight me right now...!?"
I pull her off by force.

...Oh.
Ilya looks unhappy.

"W-What? Making a face like that won't do you any good. I don't know what your intentions are, but I'm a Master. You can't defeat me that easily"
Groceries in hand, I glare at her.
...But she only looks back at me in wonder.

"......Um, Ilya?"
"Yeah!? What, Shirou!?"
"Ugh."

She isn't like before.
...Well, she was laughing back then too, but her smile is different now. Could it really be?
"...Ilya. You didn't come here to fight...?"
I ask timidly.

"What? Do you want to be killed?"
"!"
Her gaze sends a chill down my spine.
No matter how young this girl may be, she is the strongest Master.
She laughs innocently, but she can also become a ruthless Master.

"...Hmm. I don't get it, but I don't mind you saying so, nor do I mind going ahead with my plans. Do you want to die along with Saber?"
"...Don't kid around. No way! I don't want to die, and I don't want to fight you here."

"Right? Masters can't fight during daytime. You don't have Saber with you, and I don't have Berserker with me."

"...You're right. Then why did you come here? Did we meet up by chance?"
"It's not chance. I snuck out past Sella and specially came to see you. You better feel honored."
She puffs up with pride.


I feel dizzy.
Every time I think she turns into a cruel Master, she returns to being the innocent girl.
I can't tell which is the real her.

"...All right. So you came to see me.
 But you have no intention of fighting me. Am I correct?"
"Yup. I came to talk to you. I've waited all this time, so I can, right?"

I don't know what she means by "all this time", but it seems Ilya just came to talk with me.

"Or do you not want to talk with me? ...I'll go home if you don't want to. I really don't want to go home, but you'll hate me if I make you do something you don't want."
Ilya looks me straight in the eye.

"!"
...As a Master, it's dangerous to spend any time with Ilya. If Saber were here, I bet she wouldn't hesitate to make herself heard.


...But I can't leave her alone when she looks like that.
I know it's reckless, thoughtless, and rash, but...

"I don't mind talking with you. To be honest, I wanted to talk with you."

"All right! Then let's go over that way! I found a small park over there earlier!"
Ilya starts running.

"Come on, come on! I'll leave you behind if you don't hurry!"
She twirls about as she runs.

"Well, I guess it can't be helped."
I accept this turn of events and follow after Ilya.
She called me Shirou.
So I should treat her as a normal girl, and not a Master.

There is no one in the park.
Nobody is playing in the sand pit or on the swings.
It feels desolate, but I sit down on a bench with Ilya.

...This must look weird to other people.
Ilya's a foreigner, so we don't look like siblings, and our ages are too far apart to be friends.

"...So. What do you want to talk about, Ilya? You came to me, so do you have something you want to ask me?"

"Why? I have nothing I want to ask you."

Well.
How should I react to this incomprehensible girl?

"...Ilya. You're the one who wanted to talk.
 So why do you say you have no business with me? You wouldn't have come if you had no business with me, right?"
"O-Oh, really? We can't talk if we don't have business?"

"Uhh... that's not what I meant. Sorry, I put it in the wrong way. We can still talk.  Actually, I guess it's better to talk without purpose.
 ...But, man. I don't know you really well, so I don't know what I should talk about. I don't know what you like, or anything. You don't want me asking you about something you'd rather not talk about, right?"

"Y-You're right... but what should I ask? Will you promise me you won't get mad, whatever I ask you?"
"I'll try. I'm your Onii-chan, so I'll try to act mature."
"I see. Then Shirou, do you like me?"

"WHA!?"
W-W-W-W-W-What the hell is she asking!?

"Oh, you're a liar! You said you won't get mad, but you're mad!"
"Hey, anyone would be shocked by that question! Y-You shouldn't be asking that question when you've already attacked me!"

"Hey, that was different! It's because you jumped out even though you're weak! It's not my fault!"

"It is your fault! You were ready to kill from the beginning! So why are you talking about me liking you and everything!?"
Ilya quivers up and goes quiet.

"...Oh."
...Crap.
I decided that I'd forget about us being Masters, but I guess I didn't.

"...Um, Ilya?"
"......It's important to me. You're an idiot, Shirou!  If I hadn't stopped him you'd be dead right now, but you still want to talk big."
Ilya looks down, trembling.

"......Man."
I guess I have no choice.
I'm the one who started this whole Master conversation, I'm the older one here, and Ilya is a girl.

"Ahem. Um, Ilya..."
I prepare myself for what I have to say.
I
"I'm over it. My wound healed up, and you let me go.
 ...But I won't bring it up again if it bothers you. Is that okay?"

"Oh... yeah. Um, so you're not mad, Shirou...?"
"I probably should be mad, but I'm not for some reason.
 Actually, I want to talk to you now."

She was about to cry, but now she smiles.

That smile makes me happy as well.
I don't feel any hostility from her.
Then I should stop thinking like a Master.
I guess I'll have to talk with her, just like she wants
"I don't know you really well because we just met, but I don't hate you. At the very least, I want to be friends when you are like this."

"Really?"
"Um, you feel more like a little sister to me. And I won't bring up that incident again. ...That's all I can promise you. Can you believe me?"

"Yeah!
 I'll believe you if you say so...!"
Ilya tackles me and embraces my arm again.

"......Man. What are you?"
I complain, but I accept it. It's not bad.

I don't feel any hostility from her.
Her hugging me won't kill me, and it wouldn't be older brother-like to panic now.
I guess I'll have to talk with her, just like she wants
My talk with Ilya lasts for about an hour.
She listens to my pointless rambling and mundane stories.

...Since when did it start getting painful?
She is an innocent girl.
She's a Master and has no doubts about it...
I think her lack of fear about going into battle is sad.


A family of magi called Einzbern.
She is sent out as the greatest Master, a result of their thousand-year-old history.

If that is Ilya's goal, then...

"Ilya. Can I ask you something?"
"What?"
"Do you recognize the name Emiya Kiritsugu?"
...I have to ask her this question.


The air freezes.
The silence is dead.

"No. I don't know anyone like that."
...Her silver hair flutters.
Fairy-like, she gets up from the bench and turns around.

"It's getting late. Berserker's going to wake up at night, so I have to get going now."

Ilya waves goodbye.

"Yeah, I should go home too."
I get up.
This is all the rest I'll get.
We will be enemies again once the sun sets.

But...
"Can I talk with you again, Ilya?"
...I ask the question as if it's only natural.

"U-Um, I don't know. Do you want to see me again, Shirou?"
"Of course. I wouldn't ask you if I didn't want to."
"......! Okay, then I'll come again tomorrow if I feel like it. Don't expect too much and keep waiting, okay?"
She runs out of the park.

...But.
She suddenly stops.

"I was lying. He is someone I know."

"Ilya?"
"...I was given birth to this world to win the Holy Grail War. My mission is to kill you and Kiritsugu."

She sprints off.
She doesn't turn around.
I watch until she's out of sight.
"I'm home... huh? Fuji-Nee's home already?"
I take my shoes off and go into the hallway.
What is the archery club advisor doing, coming home so early?

"Welcome home, Shirou."
"...Hm, so you're finally home, simpleton."
Saber is sitting Japanese-style in a good manner, and Fuji-Nee has her head on the table in a bad manner.


Fuji-Nee looks utterly defeated.
...I'm curious as to why, but I'm sure it's nothing that important.

"I'm home. Did anything happen while I was gone, Saber?"
"No, I saw nothing unusual. How about you, Shirou? Did you find anything noteworthy at your school?"

"No, me neither. Shinji was absent, but school was like always. I don't think we need to worry about anything happening there"
With Fuji-Nee sitting right there, I can't just come out and say "there isn't a Master at my school."

"...Hm, I smell something. I feel a sour presence, like an old 10000 yen bill you forgot about hiding, a presence of a secret."

The lazy dog sniffs the air.

"You smell like rusted shackles, Shirou. Very suspicious.
 Are you hiding something from me-nya?"
"Whoa."
I can't believe it.
She's acting crazy.

"...Saber, did something happen with Fuji-Nee? It takes something really big to turn her this way."
"Uh... no, I did not do anything. I believe Taiga is lethargic because she is hungry."
She says those awful words quite casually.

"You're lying! You're the one who beat me up, saying you wanted to know how strong I am, Saber-chan!"
Fuji-Nee pounds on the table.

...It must have been a frightening, humiliating experience, since she's hiding behind me even as she glowers at Saber.
And I don't know when she started calling Saber Saber-chan.

"...Saber. Did you have a match with Fuji-Nee?"
"Um... I proposed that we move around if we had some free time. Since a match using shinai would not prove fatal, Taiga agreed with my proposal"

"Don't let her fool you, Shirou. Saber-chan was really about to kill me. I can tell. I know about guns.
 She was about to kill me. She really was about to kill me. She'll turn me into butter if I let my guard down!"

Fuji-Nee trembles.
"...Saber, um..."
Did she go all-out against Fuji-Nee...?

"Eh... um, I believe I let my guard down a bit.
 I was angry that you were late, and Taiga was stronger than I expected, so my reflexes took over"
...Wow, that's scary.
Fuji-Nee is a fifth-degree black belt in kendo, but Saber's on another level entirely.

"Anyway, don't go sneaking into Saber-chan's room at night if you don't wanna die!
 You'll see hell if you make a move on her! It'll be your own fault if you die!"
"......Ugh."

...Oh yeah.
There's another problem for me.
I have to do something about Saber, who is determined to sleep in the same room as me.
I'm a teenage guy. I don't know what'll happen if I sleep in the same room as someone like her

"You need not worry, Taiga. If that is Shirou's command, I can only obey.  I will never fight back."

"Hmmmm? Did you say something outrageous?"
"No. Taiga, I will be sleeping in the same room as Shirou tonight, but please do not misunderstand."
Saber states it as a matter of course.

Fuji-Nee freezes.

"......"
Here it comes...
Considering the power balance between us, it's going to be me.

"Fuji-Nee. I've kept this a secret until now, but..."
I try to pacify Fuji-Nee, who is standing behind me.

"Alrighty."
She completely ignores me, and I hear sounds of her stacking something like telephone books.

"Listen to me.
 Saber doesn't understand Japanese."
"Here I go."
Oh, I knew it.
She's doing something like a sleeper-hold on me.
Fuji-Nee doesn't know how to go easy, so it's really dangerous for her to choke someone

"No, this isn't the time for this! F-Fuji-Nee, you got me good! I'm really going to pass out...!"
I hear my bones creaking.
Continued grappling is Fuji-Nee's only reply.

"Whoa, I give up...! No, don't throw me now!"
I start to pass out, and as a last resort, I start to tap out.
But...

"Shut up, you spoiled brat! I never raised you that way!!!!"
Oh, I'm really passing out now.
...Man... Why don't my troubles come one at a time?

"Man, that was terrible."
I crack the joints in my neck.
Thanks to my training, I only got some bruises, even though I was thrown down to the floor.

"Um, I'm sorry... I was going to let go halfway so you could break your fall, but you were heavier than I thought and I had my hands full with just throwing you."

"Of course. I'm not a kid anymore. Don't try throwing me with those thin arms of yours. At worst, you would've fallen with me."
"...Sorry."

"You're at fault too, Saber. You'll be sleeping in the room next to mine, so we're technically not in the same room."
"Uh... But I need to protect you, so..."

"You can protect me well enough from there. First of all, I'll wear out if you sleep in the same room as me. I'm sorry, but that's the best compromise I can offer you.  If you want more from me, you're going to have to fight for it."

"Hmm... This is a difficult matter."

"It's fine if you two understand. Well, I guess I'll go cook dinner."
I get up while trying to loosen up my neck.

"Oh, Fuji-Nee.
 I'm thinking of having Sakura stay over starting tonight. What do you think? I figured I'd let her use the outbuilding where Saber stayed last night."

"You're going to let Sakura-chan stay over? I'm fine with that, but what's going on? You've been acting really strange these past few days."

"...Well, um, Sakura doesn't seem to be doing well recently. Shinji's not home much, so I thought it'd be better for her to have people around."

"Okay... I don't mind, but have you actually asked her? She seemed all right during club practice."

"No, I was going to ask her laterwait, what did you do about the club? Why did you leave so early?"
"Hm? Oh, someone got injured, so I left Mitsuzuri-san in charge, took the person home, and came straight here."

...So that's what happened, huh?
It's disturbing to hear someone got injured in the archery club, but Fuji-Nee wouldn't be here if it was serious.
I bet it's something like a jammed finger or anemia.


Well, this is my chance.
Fuji-Nee considers Sakura a part of the family, just like I do.
Then
I guess I'll have Fuji-Nee ask Sakura.
She's older than all of us, so she might be able to talk Sakura into staying here.

"Fuji-Nee. Can you ask Sakura to stay over at my place?"
"Why? There's no way I'm getting involved with what's between you two.
 You're the one who came up with the idea, so you go ask her."

"Hey, I want to ask her myself, but I'm sure she'll refuse.
 I bet she'll be troubled if a guy asks her to stay over at his place.
 ...Normally it wouldn't bother me if she refused, but I can't afford to screw up this time. I need her to stay over here for a while."

"......Geez. You're always so dense.
 All right, I'll ask Sakura-chan. So, should I have her stay over for like a week?"
"Yeah. I think things will calm down by then."

Oh.
The doorbell rings at just the right moment.

"Excuse me."
I hear Sakura's voice.
"I'm going to go ask her. You go prepare dinner, okay?"
Fuji-Nee unenthusiastically goes to greet Sakura.
...Hmm.
Did I choose the wrong person for the job?

"Sakura-chan agreed. I showed her to the guest room and she'll be here in a minute."
She says this rather carelessly as she sits down by the table.

"HuhSakura agreed to stay over?"
"Of course she did, you blockhead."
She answers while peeling a mandarin.


Okay.
I don't know how Fuji-Nee did it, but I guess asking her was the right thing to do.

No, this is an important matter.
I can't let other people handle it when it was my idea in the first place. It's not in good faith if I don't ask her myself.

...Oh.
I hear the doorbell.
"Excuse me."
I hear Sakura's voice from the entrance.
I guess I should strike while the iron's hot and go ask her right now.

"Oh, hello, Senpai. Are you about to cook dinner?"
"Yeah. I'm going to cook by myself today, so you can relax. But please look after Fuji-Nee. She lost confidence in herself because Saber beat her mercilessly. Try to finish her off and play something like Othello with her."

"Oh, that's terrible, Senpai. Today was a hard day for Fujimura-Sensei."
"...Oh yeah, she did mention something about that. Then play shogi with her."

"Shogi, huh? Okay, Fujimura-Sensei is the master at that.
 She beats me even when she gives me a handicap."

Sakura's in a good mood.
Her bruise appears to be healing, and her earlier gloominess seems to have disappeared.
Yeah, this is a good time to ask.

"So, Sakura. I know it's a bit sudden, but could you stay over at my place starting tonight?"
"Huh? Stay over at your place...?"
"I'm telling you not to go back to the Matou household for a while. Let's see... I want you to stay over for like a week. Oh, I already got Fuji-Nee's approval."

"......"
Sakura's face stiffens.
She stares at me, as if peering into my mind.

"I know I'm being unreasonable. But I'll have you stay over no matter what. I don't care what you think of me, but please stay at my place for a while."


Sakura doesn't answer.
She stares at me silently...

"Why is that?"
...And then asks me that question.

"......"
I can't tell her why.
I can't tell her that Shinji's a Master, and anything else would just be a lie.
Everyone has their secrets.
I'm a guy, so I have many secrets I can't tell Fuji-Nee or Sakura.

...There are things you just can't say, not even to the people most important to you.
But that's also why I can't lie.
Sakura's an important family member to me, so I can't lie to her.

"......"
The air feels like it's freezing over.
The silence seems to last forever, and Sakura hangs her head awkwardly.
I put my stupid brain to work, trying to come up with something to say.

"Do I really have to tell you, Sakura?"
She doesn't respond.
Instead, she just looks at me with a concerned expression.
"...Is it because you're worried about me?"
And she clearly states this.

"Yeah, I'm worried about you. It'll help me out if you stay here."
...Her long hair sways.
Sakura nods in response...
...She answers not with her words, but with a brilliant smile.
A high-pitched sound rings out.
The brilliant moonlight glints off the drawn sword as it clatters to the stairs.
"Hah."
Blood is on his lips.
The man on his knees on the stone steps bids his longsword goodbye as it falls away.

His arms are the next to fall.
Wet with blood, the elegantly-patterned fabric of his battlecoat looks like a giant red flower.

"My. I did not think you were of the serpent's kind."
In steep contrast to his bloody body, his lips are white.
Neither breath nor blood passes his throat now.
Sasaki Kojirou's internal organs no longer serve their original purpose.

The mountain gate is quiet.
The Servant that guarded the place, the shadow that appeared...
Neither of them move.
The battle has already ended.
Assassin was defeated by "someone" who came up the stone steps.
He had no time to identify the intruder as an enemy, let alone cross swords.
This "someone" was on a different level to begin with.

Assassin's body bursts open.
Torn, mutilated, and weaponless, he cannot even take his own life.
The shadow approaches.
It strokes Assassin's cheek with a scornful cherishing gesture.

A deformed, spider-like hand comes out of his stomach.
His bones crack.
His flesh rips apart.
It feels as if his organs are turning into someone else's.

"Guh!"
Assassin suppresses the regurgitating blood.
The swordsman swallows the blood and smiles with his pale lips.

"...Very well, do as you wish. After all, this is coming out of me. I'm sure it is nothing noble"
He smiles, even though he is denied an honorable death.
If one talks about a grand spectacle...
His smile is grander than the spawning of this abomination.

And thus, it is summoned.
Taking the false Servant's flesh as its own, the true Assassin enters our world.
"KiKiki, kikikikiki"
His first cries sound like those of an insect.
The black insect that crawled from the swordsman's stomach devours the body that was his own nursery.

He giggles while tearing the flesh apart.
He laughs while crunching on the bones.

Every time he does so, the insect becomes more like a man, and the empty brain acquires human wisdom.
And after a while...
He has finished sipping every last bit of the blood and blesses the birth of his own self, the "assassin".

The only ones to witness are the chorus of insects and the shining moonlight.
The high-pitched birth cry melts into the darkness.

An ominous moon.
    A white skull laughs under the black-burned sky.
After eating dinner, one only needs to take a bath and go to sleep.
This is common knowledge, barely worthy of mention.
So there's no problem.
Something so mundane couldn't possibly cause a problem.

       But...

"...Um, Fujimura-Sensei. I need to discuss something with you..."
"What is it? Go ahead and ask me."
"Um... Well......"

"Oh, right. You need something to change into.  Hmm, I guess there are school uniforms at my place. I can give you some of my clothes if you don't mind. Oh, or would you rather go to your place to get some clothes?"
"...No, I would rather not go home, since I wouldn't be able to come back here. Um, about Nii-san..."

"Oh, that's all right. I just called your place and got your grandfather's permission. He said he doesn't mind having you over at my place since I'm a teacher."
"R-Really!? Then I can really stay over here!?"
"Yup. So, about your change of clothes... you don't mind using my pajamas, right? Oh, do you want to use the same underwear too?"

"Oh... No, um... I think your bra would be too tight on me..."
"Hm. Yeah, you have big boobs.
 ...............Give me some of that."
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa! What are you doing, Sensei!?"
"Ahahahahaha, I'm just joking. ...But this is troubling. I don't have a bra your size. Are you the kind that keeps your bra on when you sleep?"

"Uh... um, yes."
"Yeah, people with big boobs tend to do that. But isn't it uncomfortable?"
"...I-It is, but what you do is........."

"I see, I see! It sure is good to be young! Then I'll get the guys at my place to buy some for you by tomorrow morning. So don't worry, just go ahead and take your bath."
"......"

"!"
S-So why are you two having this conversation right in front of me!?
I'm a guy! If you two talk about that, I won't even be able to look at Sakura without thinking...

"Ohhh? Why the red face, Shirou? Are you curious about what Sakura-chan had to say?"
"! H-Heh, what are you talking about? It's a secret between you two. I didn't hear it, and I'm not curious!"

"Oh, really? Then I'll give you an interesting piece of info. Sakura-chan is an 85. She's an E-cup. Isn't it amazing? It's 13 centimeters bigger than last year.
 I bet you noticed it too. How sexy her body is and how much you want to touch her."

"Y-You!"
"F-Fujimura-Sensei!
 I told you in secret so that he wouldn't hear it!! Why are you telling him like that!?"

"Huh? Huh? Kyaaaaa!?"

"Youidiot, Fuji-Nee..."
I finish my thought in a whisper.
Fuji-Nee falls to Sakura's counterattack.
Sakura's face is red, and she is trying to cover Fuji-Nee's mouth.

...Sakura...
I understand wanting to prevent Fuji-Nee from talking, but if you keep this up, you'll kill her...

"Haa, haa, haawow, I didn't know you were that strong, Sakura-chan. I'm surprised that you came to stop my breath right away."
"Geez! Please contemplate your actions, Fujimura-Sensei!"
Sakura gets away from Fuji-Nee.
Naturally...
Our eyes meet.

"Oh."
"Ehh, um, the towel's in the dressing room."
"O-Okay...! Um excuse me for a while, Senpai...!"

Sakura hurries out to the hallway.
"Oh"
But if she runs like that...

"Ow... I hit my nose......"
...I wanted to warn her that she'd fall...
...But she exceeds my expectations and runs straight into the wall.

"Are you all right, Sakura!?"
Was she that eager to get away?
"Yeah, I'm all right. I'm fine, so I'm going to go take a bath."
Sakura disappears into the hallway.

"Phew."
With Sakura gone, I relax.
...As tense as things were getting, I would've had to flee the room in embarrassment if she hadn't left first.

"Hah."
"...What? Go ahead and say it if you want to say something, you failure of a teacher."

"Noooothing. I'm just thinking how hard it must be for Sakura-chan. 
 I bet Sakura-chan was even more embarrassed in front of you."

"I-I'm not blushing! Hey, Sakura is like a family member to me. She's cooked for me and we've eaten together for a long time! I-I'd be a failure as her Senpai if I were embarrassed!"

"Oh, so you don't want to be a failure?"
"Of course not. Sakura is Shinji's sister. If I'm having a friend's sister over, I have to take care of her."

"What...? Oh, I see now. I just thought you were dense, but that's part of it too, huh?"
Fuji-Nee sighs.
This is troubling.

"Sakura-chan has a lot of trouble ahead of her."
"Hey, where are you going?"
"I'm going to the dressing room. I have to go get Sakura-chan some change of clothes. You can go to the outbuilding and prepare a room for her. Get her some new sheets, okay?"
Fuji-Nee leaves after giving me an order.

"...Heh. Stay here, Saber. I'm going to go prepare the guest room."
I leave after seeing Saber nod.

I make the bed and check the furniture.
I decided to have Sakura use a guest room that isn't normally used.
This room is more suited to her, and the door can be locked.
...Sakura's a girl, so that should be better for her.

"...Well, it's not like Fuji-Nee made me choose this room."
I make the bed.
This bed has never been used.
The moment I think that Sakura will sleep in this bed tonight...

'I bet you noticed it too.'

"!"
...Indecent thoughts fill my head.

"D-Don't be stupid! I"
...I already know that, without being told.
I've seen Sakura hit puberty, getting more beautiful by the day.
It was a good thing, but I also persuaded myself not to notice it.
I've always told myself that she's Shinji's sister and that she only comes to cook for me because she feels guilty about what Shinji did.

"...It's been a year and a half, hasn't it? It's nothing Sakura should care about."
The accident that caused me to quit the archery club...
I injured my shoulder, he complained about the burn, and I took the opportunity to leave the club.
...And Sakura proposed to help me out until my injury healed.

She was like a child back then.
She waited for me in front of my house one day, but it took two hours of awkward silence before she worked up the courage to say she wanted to help me.

"That shy Sakura is the rising star of the archery club now. Man, how a person can change."

Sakura is cheerful now.
I first met her four years ago when I went to Shinji's house after getting to know him.

She was quiet and had a habit of hiding her face with her hair.
...Well, she still is, but she was really lifeless back then. She always looked depressed and would just absent-mindedly stand there.
Considering that, it's wonderful to see how Sakura is doing now.
It relieves me to see Sakura, the girl who only used to look downcast, smile.

'I bet you noticed it too. How sexy her body is, how much you want to touch her.'


...I don't really know.
She was always just my underclassman.
But recently, that changed.
...I don't know if it happened recently or if I only started to notice it just now.
Or...
Was she so close to me that I didn't have to notice?

"...Damn. It's been peaceful until now. So why..."
Why is my mind going crazy from just having Sakura stay over?
I'm being inconsiderate of her.
I'll finish cleaning and show her to her room

"Huh? Where's Sakura, Saber?"
"I do not know. She is not here yet, so I would assume she is still in the bath."
"...? But it's been an hour already."

...Well, perhaps she takes long baths.
After all, she has more places to wash

"! Stop, stop, stop...! Don't imagine indecent things!"
I shake my head and sit down at the table.
I pour myself some tea and drink it.

"Phew."
I shake off the image in my head and relax.
...Then.
"Shirou. Does Sakura have bad eyesight?"
Saber asks me a strange question.

"...? No, Sakura has good eyesight.
 I think she has 1.5 vision."
"I see. She often runs into walls, so I was worried that she might have bad vision."

"Oh, I see. Thanks for worrying, but Sakura's fine. She's clumsy now because she's tired. She's usually more reliable than me."

"I hope so. ...But even in that case, it is a problem if she is tired enough to mistake the wall for a door. This is only my personal opinion, but I believe it was not caused by fatigue."


That's a very natural conclusion.
Even if you're tired, you still shouldn't be running into walls.

"......"
Where is Sakura anyway?
Even if she's taking a bath, an hour is too long.
I
I should go check on her.
If Saber's right, this isn't the time to be hung up on embarrassment.

"Sakura."
I call out to her from the hallway.
There's no reply from inside the dressing room.
No, I don't even feel a presence in there.

"Sakura...? Hey, are you in there, Sakura?"
I knock on the door.
...I gradually start to knock harder, and I'm banging on the door before I notice.

"Sakura...! Hey, say something...!"
My anxiety turns to cold certainty.
...Something's wrong.
I can't go inside, so I'll have to get Saber or Fuji-Nee

"Huh? S-Senpai? Why are you so flustered?"
"S-Sakura...!? ...Oh, it's nothing. I was wondering if something was wrong, since you were in there for a while."

"A while...? Was I in here that long?"
"...?"
Sakura sounds absent-minded.
She sounds lost in thought, as if she'd just woken up.

"...Sakura. Don't tell me you were..."
"......Yes. It was so relaxing that I fell asleep a bit..."
"YYou idiot. Don't scare me like that."
I crumple down to the floor.

"...I'm sorry. I'll get out right away."
"Please do. ...Man, you'll catch a cold if you sleep in the bathtub."

I lean against the wall.
...It turned out to be nothing, but I'm glad Sakura's okay.
She should be better once she gets a good night's sleep.

"Huh?"
I hear the sound of something heavy falling.
It came from the other side of the door.

"Sakura!?"
There's no reply.
I feel no presence on the other side of the door.

"...! I'm coming in, Sakura!"
I rush into the dressing room.
There, I see Sakura on the floor.

"Sakura, Sakura...!"
I hold Sakura up in my arms.
Her body is soft and surprisingly hot.

"Ahhm"
She doesn't seem to be conscious, but she's moaning in pain.
Her hand grabs her chest, as if wanting to take her shirt off.

"Haa......"
She gasps.
...This is way too much for me.
Her body is soft, and her hair is unraveled.
Her shirt is the only thing between my arms and her body, and this isn't the Sakura I know.

Her shirt sticks to her body and emphasizes her large breasts, and I can't take my eyes off of them.
Her breasts move up and down along with her breaths, exposing her white neck.


It feels like my heart will leap out of my chest.
My head wouldn't be this hot even if I drank a love potion.
I realize that my mouth is watering, and I swallow with great difficulty.

"Ah... Hm......"
Her beautiful lips make my head go wild.
Her body is so hot and soft that it makes me imagine how good it must taste.

My head goes blank.
It's not a girl's body I'm holding, but a woman's.
This isn't the Sakura I know.
Thenit shouldn't be a problem if I hold her a little

"...! What the hell am I thinking...!?"
I shake my head.
This isn't the time.
Even considering that Sakura just got out of the bath, her temperature isn't normal.
Moreversimple anemia wouldn't make her clutch at herself like that.

"Sakura! Hey, are you all right, Sakura...!?"
I call out to her.
"Ahfua...?"
...The hairs sticking to her forehead drop down.
Sakura slowly opens her eyes and stares at me.

"Huh? Senpai...? Why are you here...?"
"Hey, it's not 'Why am I here?'...! You should've told me if you're sick!"
"Huh...? II'm sick?"

"Who else would it be...!? Try feeling your forehead! It's burning hot!"
"Huh? But I don't feel hot at all..."
Sakura must still be half-asleep, as she is still in a daze.

"Just don't move! I'm going to take you to your bed...!"
"Kya...!? What's going on, Senpai...!?"
"I'm taking you to your room. Don't struggle, okay? I don't know if I can keep a hold if you do."
I lift up Sakura in my arms and go out to the hallway.

"...! S-S-Senpai, you're carrying me!?"
I must have surprised her, as she clings on to my neck.

"!"
I feel something soft on my chest, but I have to ignore it for now...!

"Man, this is harder than my daily training...!"
It's a matter of speed now.
I have to carry Sakura to her room before my reasoning disappears...!

"Let's see. Your temperature is a bit over 37 degrees. Oh, it's lower than I thought."
I put the medical thermometer down and look at Sakura.

"...I'm sorry... I guess I got dizzy since I was so nervous."
Sakura hides her face with the futon.

"You can't help catching a cold, right? You should be better by tomorrow if you drink some medicine and get a good night's sleep.
I'll leave some water here on the chair, so don't go out of the building, okay? You'll cool your body if you go outside."
I put another blanket over her, just in case, and turn the lights off.

"All right. I'll come wake you up tomorrow morning, so you just take it easy until then."
I pat her on her head, then start to walk to the door.
Then...
Something pulls me back.
"...?"
I turn around to see that Sakura's holding my sleeve.

"Sakura...? Um, I can't leave if you're holding onto my shirt like that."
"Huh?"
She must have been doing it unconsciously, since she jerks her hand away when she realizes it.

"I-I'm sorry, Senpai...! I-I-I wasn't thinking...!"
Sakura jumps up and tries to make an excuse.
Even in the dark, I can tell that she's blushing furiously.

"Um, are you scared, Sakura?"
"......I am. It's scary to sleep alone in a place I don't know."
Her hair is hiding her face, so I can't see her expression.
...But right now she seems just like the shy girl I met years ago.

"I see. You must be uneasy, sleeping in an unfamiliar room with a cold."
I sit down on the floor.
I lay my back against her bed.
It's for the best, because I don't think I can face Sakura right now.

"U-Um, Senpai...?"
"I'll stay here for a while. You should get used to the room in a little bit, and I'll go if you fall asleep before that.
 To be honest, I'm worried that you might push yourself. I'll stay here for at least thirty minutes, so lay down and relax."
I raise my hand and flutter it.

"Okay. Then please keep me company for just a bit."

I feel a slight movement of air.
It must be Sakura pulling up her blanket.
...I'm glad I can help Sakura like this.
This is nothing compared to what she has done for me.



The sound of the clock ticking echoes through the dark room.
I don't know if it's because I have my back to her, or because I saw her sad face.
But the emotions that assailed me when I carried Sakura have disappeared, and I'm able to calmly stare at the clock.
...And after a long period of silence...

"Are you awake, Senpai?"
A gentle voice lights up the darkness.

"..."
I nod in response.
That must have been good enough...

"...Okay. Thank you for everything you did today."
...And Sakura falls asleep peacefully.
...Yeah.
Fuji-Nee would make fun of me for a whole year if I did go and happened to walk in on Sakura changing.

"I can't do that to Sakura."
Yes, I should sit tight and wait.
She might be already out and drying her hair.

"You are restless, Shirou."
"Huh? I-I don't think so. I'm eating my mandarin and drinking my tea."
"So you relax by not eating or drinking and looking often at the clock?"

"Ugh. Um, I have no appetite because I'm full."
"I see. I do not mind if you say so. But I do not believe it is a good idea to hold yourself back."

Saber elegantly sips her tea.
...Man, I'm hopeless!
It hasn't even been five minutes yet, but I'm really worried about Sakura!

"Man, I don't care what Fuji-Nee says!
 Saber, I'm going to the bathroom!"
I make up my mind and stand up.
At that moment...

Fuji-Nee comes running in.

"Fuji-Nee...? Why are you in such a rush? Weren't you preparing for Sakura's stay?"
"I finished that already. More importantly, can you look after Sakura-chan? I'm going back to my house to get some medicine."
"...!? What's wrong with Sakura, Fuji-Nee?"

"That's what I want to know. Sakura-chan was on the floor when I went to the dressing room, and she has a fever of almost 38 degrees."

"Whawhere's Sakura, Fuji-Nee...!?"
"I just carried her to the guest room. I think she just has a cold, so don't worry too much.
 But we can't push her. I'm going back to my place to get some stuff, so you just be there for Sakura-chan, okay? That should provide plenty of energy for her all by itself."

Fuji-Nee fires off my instructions and goes back to her house.
The Fujimura household has perfect preparations for illness and injuries, as it has lots of "those" kind of people.

"......!"
This isn't the time to stand around in shock.
I have to go check on Sakura...!

"Let's see. Your temperature is a bit over 37 degrees. Oh, it's lower than I thought."
I put the medical thermometer down and look at Sakura.
It's been thirty minutes.
Her condition wasn't that bad, just like Fuji-Nee said. She has a slight cold, and she collapsed in the dressing room because she felt dizzy after staying in the bath for too long.

"...I'm sorry... I guess I got dizzy since I was so nervous."
Sakura hides her face with her futon.

"You can't help catching a cold, right? You should be better by tomorrow if you drink some medicine and get a good night's sleep.
I'll leave some water here on the chair, so don't go out of the building, okay? You'll cool your body if you go outside."
I put another blanket over her, just in case, and turn the lights off.

"All right. I'll come wake you up tomorrow morning, so you can rest easy until then."
I pat her on her head, then walk to the door.
"...Yes. Good night, Senpai."
Sakura sounds apologetic.
I bid her goodnight and leave her room.
The lights go out.
It's eleven o'clock, and the town is going to sleep.

"So there is a Master at the Ryudou Temple?"
"According to Tohsaka. She said we shouldn't fight them because they are troublesome enemies, but it seems the coma incidents in town are their doing. ...I don't know if it's true or not, but we have to find out."

"...You are right. I do feel something intentional in the ley line pointing to the Ryudou Temple. I am sure that a Master is on that mountain."
"...? What's wrong, Saber? You seem like you're not up for it. You have less spirit than last night."

"You are right. That mountain is an ominous place for Servants.
 I would like to avoid careless attacks."

"...Hm. Should we just patrol the town tonight and put off attacking the Ryudou Temple until we get more information? It is reckless to go attack them when we don't know anything about our enemy."

"No, there is no need for that. A Master that would set up his base in the Ryudou Temple would not readily reveal his identity. If we are to quickly defeat him, we must face them straight on and power through."

Saber is determined.
...She must believe we have a chance.  Either way, if the Master at the temple is responsible for all the recent coma victims, we have to do something.

"All right, let's go to the Ryudou Temple.
 But we're only going to investigate tonight.
 We'll retreat once we find out who the Master is and what Servant he has. I'd like to do more, but I can't support you, so I want to be cautious."

I can't allow Saber to get hurt, just like the fight with Berserker.
If I can't help her directly, I have to protect her in some other way.

"......Understood. I shall entrust you with the final judgment. Please decide then if we are to retreat or fight."
"...Hm. I'm glad to hear that, but it's also scary. I might wuss out even if the enemy is weak."

"I see. That is certainly a possibility, since you have little experience in battle."
"Yeah, that's right. I want to avoid heading into a minefield, so please warn me."

"Understood. Then I shall do so if you make a wrong choice.
 You will learn little if I merely warn you, so I shall impose a penalty if you make a mistake."
"...Hey, what do you mean by 'penalty'?"

"Where would the enjoyment be in telling you?  I shall keep it a secret, since this is one of the few pleasures I have."
...Ugh.
That joke isn't very Saber-like. It must be Fuji-Nee's influence.
I really do hope it's just a joke.

"But putting that aside, Shirou... will Sakura be all right?  She seemed unusually distressed."
"I thought so too, but I didn't see anything unusual when I took her temperature. I'll let her get a good night's sleep and see how she is tomorrow."

"I see. Then we can head out into battle without worry."
I nod and look at the outbuilding.
Sakura's room is on the second floor.
I have to leave without her noticing, and I have to come back as if nothing has happened.

"Let's go, Saber. I have to act like a Master now. I won't think about anything else."

I leave with Saber at my side.
High overhead, clouds pass before the moon, and the darkness deepens.
The wind is blowing the overhead clouds.
Lit by fading moonlight, we start running towards enemy territory.
It's already after two in the morning.
Despite my daily training, running to the Ryudou Temple and back is still tiring.

"...Oh. Can you go ahead to your room, Saber?"
"...? Where are you going, Shirou? Are we not finished for the night?"

"Yeah. I'll be back in a minute, so don't worry. I'm tired too, so I want to rest soon."
"I see. You must be worried about Sakura."

"Uh, I have to go take her some water. You go sleep in the room next to mine, Saber. Close the door, okay?"

"Oh, yes.  It will do little good if we are not in the same room, but there is nothing to be done if you insist on being stubborn. I shall stand by in the room next to yours."

Saber looks discontented.
...Humph.
You're stubborn as well.

"Oh... Man."
I return to my room, filled with self-hatred.
"It's 3 AM... What was I doing for an hour in there?"

I let out a heavy sigh.
There's only one simple explanation.
Sakura looked like she wasn't sleeping well, so I took time adjusting her blanket and bringing her fresh water.

Such simple tasks were really painful and difficult for me.
It's all because...
...Sakura looked so alluring in her sleep.

"I wish I had a blindfold or something."
That would've solved everything.
...Well, I had my eyes closed anyway, but a blindfold would've prevented me from giving in to temptation and opening them!

"Man, why am I so easily excited!?"
Man, I have a hyper imagination.
It's all Sakura's fault for growing so big.
How can she mature like that in just a year...!?

"That's it, I'm going to sleep. I'm gonna sleep, I'm gonna sleep, I'm gonna sleep!"
I pull the blanket over my face and shake off my indecent thoughts.


I'll close my eyes and clear my mind.
...See.
My body's tired, so I should be able to go to sleep right away

  Hmm...!! Aha, ahh, ahh, ha...!

It's red.
I'm in the depths of pitch black sleep, but there's someone in this red classroom.

Fua, haa, ahit feels good, Emiya-kunit's in so deep...! ...Ah, I can feel it all the way up into my head

I hear a familiar voice.
I hear dripping sounds along with smacking sounds.

...! Ah, don't mix me upnha, hah, nhaaaaa...!

I hear a perverted voice.
I feel skin beneath my fingers.
The haze in my mind clears a bit.
...I'm sleepy.
I'm sleepy, but if I hear that voice, I have no choice but to get up.

I open my eyes.
When did the sun set?
I'm joining in her secrecy in this desolate classroom.

"Good. You're here, Emiya-kun."

Her sticky voice is filled with anticipation for an outrage.
Her cheeks are flushed, and she smiles lasciviously as if she cannot contain her lust.

"What's wrong...? Nobody will trouble us here.
 You can do whatever you want with me, just like always."

The woman comes near me.
Unable to wait, I pull her closer.
"Mm, fuh......!"
We kiss.
We devour each other's mouths. We fight for each other's tongues, saliva, and even the air in our lungs.

"Mm, haa, hm......!!"
I feel dizzy.
I'm still groggy from waking up.
Wanting to feel something, I let my hands roam over the woman's slender waist, her firm breasts, and her sculpted collarbone.
Not knowing who I am, I keep violating the person in front of me.

"Ahhmm... You're rough. You're acting different today, Emiya-kun."
Does she want to catch her breath, or does she want it now?
She pushes away, and...

Look.
       I'm already like this.

...She takes off her skirt.
The classroom is instantly filled with the smell of woman.
The light shines wetly off of her exposed flesh.

The scent of woman fills the air.
The sight of her bare legs makes it even harder to focus.

I'm like an insect attracted to honey.
I expose my erect self and advance to devour the flesh in front of me.

"...Geez. This is no different from usual."

She gives a mischievous smile.
She pokes my nose with her finger and...
"Herefuck me from behind."
She twists her hips suggestively.

"...Hm, ku!"
I penetrate her without hesitation.
There's no need for foreplay. She's so wet that her juice will start dripping if I wait any longer.

"Ahh...! Emiya-kun's penetrating me"
I push myself in.
My dick feels like it's boiling, but she feels hotter still.

I feel nauseous.
It's like she's squeezing the cum out of me.
The pleasure courses through me like electricity, blowing away my drowsiness and blanking my mind.

"Haahh, ah... What's wrong...? Won't you come deeper inside of me...?"
Her sweet voice pulls me back to this world.
I expand inside her in response to her warmth.

"Hmm...! Aha, yes, like that, more...!"
It's as if there's no limit.
My penis expands her walls and the sexual desire fills up to my fingertips.

"Auu...! Hmm, hm...! It's coming in...!"
I move my hips.
Even when I try to pull out, her walls contract to draw me back in.

"Ahh, ha! Ahh, it's so bigahh, haaI'm going crazyI... feel like I'm penetrated, all, throughout my body"
She clamps down even more.
I break myself loose and keep moving.
I move slowly at first, then faster and faster.

"...!? Ah, nha, ahh...! Ahh, no, ahn, oh, fuh, haa...!"
I show her no consideration.
My grotesque meat stabs into her, striking against her womb.

"Haa, ah! You're tearing me!"
Her body stiffens.
Her breathing matches the rhythm of her hips and her hair tosses in the air.

"Ahh, it, ahh... it feels good, Emiya-kunmore, push it in harder!"
The dizziness intensifies.
This feels too real to be a dream, but this could never happen in real life, and those facts confuse me.

Her lewdness is a great nightmare.
Her anus is defenseless.
It contracts every time I move, looking like a second reproductive opening.
Tohsaka's anus.
The dirtiest part of her is right in front of me.

"Hm, ah...! Ahh, hah, ah...! Ahh, it feels good, Emiya-kun, ah, it's rubbing me...!"
Our intercourse does not stop.
The sensation of squishing a ripe fruit.
The drilled holeno, the point of our connection is wet and the juice dirties her thighs.

It's not just her that's dirtied.
Her vulgar juice overflows from her crevice and sticks to me.

"Haa, nha, ah! ...Ahh, ahh... ahaha... aha, I'm like a dogthis feels good"

The woman raises her hips higher.
The movement gets heavier.
Her ass is larger than one would imagine just by looking at her.
I dig my fingers into it and hold her in place.

"...Haa, hah, haa, ah...!"
I hear the sweet sound of her juices.
The woman's voice is close to a scream.
She puts her chin up with every stroke, begging for more.

"Aha... ahh... it's so loud
 Ahh, it feels goodgive me more, Emiya-kun...!"
Her firm butt shakes.
She frantically keeps control of her body that's about to crumple from the pleasure.

The dizziness turns into pain.
The sperm in my testicles is about to burst out.

"Nha...! It's getting biggerfuh, ah, ah, hmm...!"
It must be the same for her.
She struggles, as if to get away from my thrusting.
Her arching back, the different angles, the squeezing walls...
She convulses in response to my wild thrusts.

"Hi, hia, ah, hm! Ah, it hurts...!"
Her walls entangle around my penis. Her skin is covered in sweat.
The wet flesh wraps around the head of my shaft.
It's like a diving suit that's too small.
I force myself into the tight hole.

"...!! Ah, haa, nhaa...! No, ah...! I, I...!"
I reach it.
I can't put a lid on my overflowing desire.

"Hmlet it out! I want your cum, Emiya-kun...!"
She's right. There's no need to hold back.
I thrust myself into the deepest part of her and release my cum.

"Nha... hm, it's hot... it's... still coming out and hitting me."
It doesn't all splash out.
I slowly ejaculate over a long period of time.

The sheer, impossible volume makes me realize.
This is a dream.
I'm so tired, as if I ejaculated all my blood.
The ejaculation spanning a few minutes is a great pleasure as well as torture.

"Wowyou let out a lot... and it's splashing inside of me."
...I'm starting to pass out.
Everything, from my unending climax to Tohsaka's trembling back, feels like an impossible dream

So, why is it not ending?
All that's left is to sleep, but it doesn't end.
Noif this is a dream, then there's no guarantee that I'd return to reality even if I did fall asleep.

"Hm... Let's keep going, Emiya-kunyou want to feel better, right?"

Her voice echoes in my brain.
My body does not move.
I've ejaculated half my organs, after all.  What human could move after such a feat?

"......I see. Then it's my turn."

I hear her snicker.
...When did I fall onto the desk?
I'm on my back, and the woman crawls over my body like a lizard.

"Hm... hold stillI'm going to eat you."

She blows her sweet breath on my neck.

"!"
My body jumps.
Despite my numbed brain, my sexual desire still rushes forth.

"Hm... it's already in... Hm, fuh... it's a bit hardbut yours feels good, Emiya-kun..."
We become one with a sound.

"Ah, haa... Does it feel good...? It's already erect, Emiya-kun, ah, haan...!"

Tohsaka's flesh is completely wrapped around me.
My empty body is filled anew with pleasure.
She's demanding too much. Even if she demands it, I have nothing I can give back to her.

"Ahh... ahh, nha, haa, ah!"
But she doesn't care.
She grinds her hips against me.
She wraps around me and tries to take me in, just like a pure girl's confession of love.

"Haa, like this? I'm letting it loosebut does it feel good...?"
Tohsaka lowers herself onto me in an almost gentle caress.
But her slow movement has the opposite effect.
I'm going mad with the torture.

"Hm... is it painful, Emiya-kun...?
 Hmm... I'm sorry... I'll make you feel good right away"
Tohsaka contracts her muscles and moves.
She doesn't notice my limit and keeps caressing me with her clumsy knowledge.

"Ah, hm...! Hah, so you did want more. See, it's fully erect now."
I... can't believe it.
I ejaculated so much, and there's still more?

"Ah, mm...! Haa, aha... Don't move. I'll movenfu, hmm, ahhh...!"
...She slowly starts to move faster.
I don't know if it's because I'm not moving, or if she's just too caught up in the pleasure.

"Ah... ha, ah... it's so good... and this is rather pleasant. Having you under me to do with as I please."
She's panting like a girl indulging in masturbation.

"Hmm, faa, mm...! Ah, it feels so good...!"
She looks too horny to be called lovely.
But Tohsaka is pure, a virgin who knows no men.

"Aha, ah...! ...Emiya-kun!
 ...Fuaa, noI can't stop my fingersyour dick is enough to fill me up, but...!"

I get an urge to violate the girl in front of me.
My erect penis pushes into her.

"...! Ah, haa...! It's coming in so deep...!"
I break through her hymen.
The sequence of events is backwards, but I don't care.
Pain turns into pleasure, and Tohsaka demands even more.

"Haa, aha, hau...! I need more, keep moving! Mix me up...!"
Tohsaka moves her fingers while drowning in pleasure.
She seeks greater pleasure by fondling herself.

"Fua...! Ah, mm...!"

She doesn't stop.
The slit holding me in is wet with both our fluids.

"Ahh, fuaa, ahh, nohmm, ou... Ah...!!"
She rubs her own juice onto her clit and puts even more weight on me.

The pleasure doubles.
My dick expands to avoid being crushed.


I want to ejaculate.
It feels so good.
Her ass is soft and her thighs are smooth, urging me to orgasm.

"Haa, mm, no, ahh...! No, it's hot inside...!"
She squeezes down on me like a leech.
Many needles poke at my nerves.
Her walls stimulate, penetrate, and release my sexual desire.


I bear it with all my might.
The tattered remnants of my reason tell me that it's dangerous to succumb to the pleasure.

"Hmno, you can't do thatyou have to"

Be devoured by me here.

", "
I let it out.
My brain burns up from the great ejaculation.

"Ahahm, it tastes so goodyour sperm is so strong that it tickles"
Tohsaka accepts my cum.
...Is it because this is a dream?
It should be dripping out of her, but none of it is flowing out.

...But that's a trivial matter.
I can finally go to sleep now.
I am utterly dry, and it should be impossible for Tohsaka to go on.
She pushed herself in spite of this being her first time, so her pussy is covered in blood.
Tohsaka is at her limit, just like me.

So this is the end.
The dream should end here, but...
"Hmm... I want more"
Our sex starts again, like a tape that has been rewound.

It doesn't stop.
Our bodies start convulsing again, declaring it's not enough.
Ignoring the protests of my mind, they seek more pleasure.


It's a long afternoon.
I melt into Tohsaka in this empty classroom.

"Yeah... this is great, Emiya-kunI'll serve you nicely"

Her lovely voice echoes inside my head.
As we desire each other, I will stay in this dream until the afternoon ends
Light flows in.
The warmth I feel through my eyelids informs me that it is morning.

I turn over and look away from the light.
"Hm"
I still feel sleepy.
Judging by the feel of the air, it's around 5:30.


I went to bed late last night.
I came home from the church, forced Saber to sleep in the other building, and finally went to sleep myself around 3AM.
...I don't know if I can cope with getting only two hours of sleep.
It was a frenetic, exhausting day yesterday.
Nobody can blame me if I sleep for another 30 minu

"Huh?"
I think I saw something.
It's by my futon.
It seems something big is by my futon.

"......"
...Come to think of it, I feel someone's presence.
I feel restless, as if someone is watching me. So this means

"Saber......!"
"Yes, what is it, Shirou?"
"W-Why are you in my room!? I gave you a separate room last night!"

I leap up from the futon to my feetno, I stop myself at the last second.
I can't show her my lower half because... um... it's morning.

"Yes, and I think there is a problem with it. You directed me to a room, but that room is not close enough to yours. I need to be by your side so that I may protect you."

"H-Hold on, just get away from me...!
 Just get away, please get away, no, I'll get away if you won't...!"

Still rolled up in my futon, I scramble away from Saber.
"...?"
Saber looks at me with wonder.

Man, what does she think of a healthy guy of my age!?
I get nervous from just having her close to me, so it's really shocking if she's sitting by my side when I wake up. And it was a surprise attack too!  If my composure were an army, that would've just annihilated it.

"Shirou. As I was saying."
"Ugh... you mean the room?"

"Yes. We should sleep in the same room to be safe.
 The boundary field on this house is excellent, but it only serves as a warning. It will do nothing to shield you if we are attacked here."
"......"

Saber has a point, but I wish she would consider the state of my nerves.
I'll go crazy before any enemy attacks us if I sleep in the same room with Saber.
It's not like I'll be with Saber all the time, so we should distance ourselves

"Oh."
I totally forgot about it.
I have school today...!

"Shirou? Why are you so pale? I have noticed that you make that face whenever you are about to suggest something foolish."


She's sharp.
Her previous aura of loyalty is gone, and she keeps me at bay with a distrustful look.

"Well, there's something I forgot to tell you."
I kneel and face her.
...Well.
How can I phrase things so that she'll approve of me going to school?
"......"
"......"
I feel her staring at me, and it hurts.
Saber is sitting Japanese-style while I cut the tofu...
...Staring at me with that expression of hers.

'I will go to school like usual.'
We never reached a compromise after I said that.
Saber objected, of course.
She says it is dangerous for me to be alone.
But I have my personal life too.

Fuji-Nee will get suspicious if I skip school, and I won't know what's going on outside if I stay indoors.
And to go somewhere with Saber means warning other Masters.
I think the results will be good enough if I go out on my own. And most of all...

"Masters fight where there are no people, right? Then I'll be safe during the day. Nobody will attack me unless I go someplace deserted."
But Saber insisted that it's not going to be enough.
...Her excessive concern pissed me off, so I stubbornly insisted that I'm going to school, and this is the result.

"......"
Her glare feels like it's burning into me.

The moral of the story is...
She'll bear a big grudge if you make her mad. And she gets out of hand because she is emotional.
So I should be careful not to act stubborn again.

"...Man, you inflexible blockhead."
"Did you say something, Shirou?"
"No, I'm just talking to myself. This tofu's really tough."

...And she has sharp ears. She's not the type you want to get into a cold war with.

"Huh? It's that time already?"
After the doorbell, I hear the front door opening.
And I also hear the familiar tone of Sakura's voice.

"Oh, so I lost 30 minutes while I was arguing with Saber."

But breakfast is almost ready.
I thought about having bread to please Saber, but it seemed too much like bribery, so I changed my mind.
Japanese people eat rice.
I'll counter her violent glare with pressure of "when in Rome, do as the Romans do".

"Good morning, Senpai. Are you already done cooking?"
"Yeah, I'm pretty much done. Good morning, Sakura. Fuji-Nee should be coming soon, so help me serve the food."

"Okay! I'll be helping you."
Sakura sets her bag down in the living room and greets Saber.

"Good morning, Saber-san. Were you able to sleep well last night?"
"Yes. It was not a familiar room, but it was not a problem since I am familiar with this house."
...Oh, they're talking.
They didn't talk much yesterday, but I guess Sakura's gotten over it after one night.

"Sorry to keep you waiting, Senpai. What should I start with?"
"Can you get one big plate and four small ones? The salad's done, so you can serve it."

"Okay. Wow, we're having German potato salad this morning?
 You're elaborate this morning, cooking Western food."

Sakura is surprised, but she scoops out the salad onto the big plate.
The salad is the only Western food I made.
...You have to understand, I'm not giving in to Saber.  I'm just... proactively trying to clear the air between us.

"Oh, it smells good. Can I try some, Senpai?"
"Yeah, but it's hot. And it might be sweet, too."
"...?"
Sakura picks up a piece of potato with the cooking chopsticks.

"Hmm... Oh, it really is sweet. That's not... onion, is it?"
Licking her lips, Sakura tries to figure out the ingredients.


Her gesture surprises me.
I should be used to seeing Sakura sample my food, but when she's so close, I can't take my eyes off her.

"Wow, this is really good, Senpai! I like this taste!"
Sakura must really like it, as she happily scoops the salad onto the big plate.
There's nothing unusual about it.
The surprise fades, and I sigh with relief.

"Oh, hold on, Sakura."
"Yes? What is it, Senpai?"
She's the same as always.
She's no different from yesterday.
It should not concern Sakura even if Shinji was a Master or even if her family is a family of magi.

There's no way Sakura would be involved in the conflict.
There's no way, but...
"Sakura. Let me see your right cheek."
There's a bruise on her right cheek, as if she's been punched.

"Oh... it's not what you think, Senpai. I, um, fell on the stairs."

There's only one person who Sakura would make excuses for.
She's been like this for a long time.
She would be strangely lively or unnaturally depressed.

It always meant Shinji was taking things out on her.  When I first found out about it, I went and punched him.
...But he's never done something this bad before.
About half a year ago, I spotted a bruise on Sakura's arm.
I hit Shinji when I realized he'd done itbut he's never punched a girl's face!

"Damn him..."
"S-Senpai"
I hear a sharp crack.
It seems I broke the chopsticks in my hand.

"I'm pissed. I told him never to hit his sister again, but he couldn't keep such a simple promise...!?"

"No, Senpai. You've got it all wrong. I just fell, really. I fell when Nii-san bumped into me."
"Sakura."

"That's all that happened, Senpai.
 ...Please don't concern yourself with Nii-san right now.
 He's been acting weird since last night. He's really annoyed, so he might say odd things to you."


Sakura is defending her brother.
If the person who got hit isn't complaining, I definitely can't.

...And I know why Shinji's acting strange.
Shinji was abnormal last night.
His rights as a Master were taken away, and he was humiliated by his own grandfather.
He must have taken out his anger on Sakura after he went home.

"Kuh."
Sakura doesn't know anything.
Nobody's told her about her brother, or about the secret of the Matou family.
Thenis it safe for her to live with Shinji when he's in such a state?
He hasn't given up.
Sakura is a convenient outlet for his violent personality.

"...Um, Senpai? I'm sorry to trouble you so early in the day."
"You idiot. Don't say that."

I'm the one who caused the trouble.
I should've expected this when I fought Shinji last night.
I have to think of a way...
A way to keep Sakura smiling

A dismal air hangs over the rest of the morning.
Fuji-Nee didn't turn up for some reason, and Sakura was quiet all through breakfast.
Saber doesn't talk much to start with, and I'm not the garrulous type.
It doesn't take long to finish breakfast, so Sakura leaves 40 minutes early to go to her morning practice.

"...Um, I'll be going now, Senpai."
Sakura forces a smile as she puts on her shoes.

"Oh, don't push yourself too hard with your club activity. You always tried to go there even when you were sick, right? Just practice moderately and go sip some tea in the back. If Mitsuzuri says something, tell her I'll owe her one."

"Okay. I'm sure Captain would love that."
Sakura opens the door.
She bows and turns to leave
...And walks right into the door.

"S-Sakura!?"
"Oww."
She holds the nose she banged onto the door.

"A-Are you all right, Sakura!? Is your nose bleeding!?"
"No, I'm fine. I'd die if you saw my nose bleeding"
Sakura staggers and gets up.
...It doesn't seem like it was Sakura's usual clumsiness.

"...Are you really all right, Sakura? It looked like you fell. If you got dizzy, then..."
"Huh...? No, that can't be. I was just careless, so, um... this is embarrassing."
"......"

"Then I'll be going now. I'll tell Fujimura-Sensei that your breakfast was good, like always."
Sakura leaves, as if to shake off my worries.


I guess she's all right.
If anything, she's suffering from mental exhaustion.

"...And then there's Shinji. I can't just leave her be..."
But I have no clear solution.
I can't consult Saber, nor can I tell Sakura the truth. Fuji-Nee is out of the question, of course.


...Damn, if only there were someone else at school who I could talk to about the Holy Grail War
"...Man. People like that don't just conveniently appear out of nowhere..."
We run up the stone steps.
Saber is already armed.



We're both straining our nerves in preparation for an enemy attack.
The steps are long, and the wind is warm even though we're near the mountaintop.

According to Saber, this mountain has a boundary field that repels Servants.
Servants will lose most of their power and magical energy if they enter the mountain from anywhere other than the front gate.
Therefore, the only way we can enter is through the front gate, but...

"...I thought they would be setting up an ambush. Do you sense a Servant around here, Saber?"
"No.
 There are no other Servants around"
Saber suddenly stops and looks down.

"Saber...? Did you see something?"
"...No, it must be my imagination. I thought I saw a katana, but I cannot find it anywhere.
 The mountain gate is not guarded. Let us go inside the temple."

Saber starts running again.
"...?"
I tilt my head in wonder, but hurry to keep up with her.

...The compound is dead silent.
The wind is strong.
All around is thick darkness.
Despite the moon overhead, the terrible darkness remains.


I look up.
The moon is there, of course.
Its rays shine down on the compound.
But the area is still shrouded in darkness.

"Saber."
"Yes, something is wrong.  No one would let us come this far without offering resistance. Andthis place is too quiet."
"...Let's go inside. The Ryudou Temple has close to fifty people living in it.
 It can't be this quiet."

We head for the temple.
There's no one around.
After confirming that the compound is empty, we go inside.

Everyone in the temple is sleeping.
They do not even twitch.
They don't react even when we touch them.
All the monks, without exception, are weakened.
No matter how hard we try to rouse them, they just lie there, breathing peacefully as if enjoying a dream.

Of course, my classmate is among them.
Ryudou Issei is sleeping peacefully as well.


We quickly move across the wooden hallway.
...It's because Saber felt a presence.
Saber pointed toward the main temple building.
The Master responsible for this disaster is there.

We step into the shrine.
The first thing we see is the red blood spreading on the floor.

"...!?"
A red flower blooms in the center of the temple.
There is a man lying there as well.
His chest must be pierced, as the man is dyeing the floor red.

The wound is fatal, and the man has lost enough blood to die.
He's already a corpse.
I know this man, and it seems he was Master to the one standing beside his body.

The Servant is looking down at her Master with a mysterious dagger in hand.
"......!"
Pain lances through my head, accompanied by a sense of apprehension.
It's not that I'm scared of this scene.

That
That dagger is ominous.
It seems Saber does not feel anything, but I can tell that the dagger has dreadful power.

"Caster...!"
Saber readies herself.
The Servant in a purple robe, Caster, does not answer.
I don't know if Saber took it as an opening or as an insult...
But she tries to charge

"No, hold on, Saber...!"
"Shirou...!? Why are you stopping me? This is our best chance to defeat Cast"

"No, just don't go near that dagger...! That thing can break contracts. It might even cut the bond between a Servant and a Master."
"ThenCaster killed her own Master?"

"......"
I don't know if she did.
But I'm sure the dagger she's holding has unearthly power.

"Casteryou killed your own master...!!"
Saber rushes in with an angry roar.
...Caster turns around.
With her vigor gone, she looks more like a ghost than a heroic spirit.

The sword flashes through the air.
It slices the robe, but Caster manages to jump back.

"Saber...?
 I see.  You must have come to finish me off. I don't know whose plot this is, but he is quite thorough."

"Silence. I do not want anything from a person who betrayed her master. Regret your actions and take your punishment."
"HahI killed my Master? I killed Souichirou-sama?
 Fuhhaha, ahahahahaha! That is funny! Perhaps I should have done so, if it was going to turn out like this...!"

She starts laughing maniacally.
The black-robed magus puts her dagger away and points at Saber.

"You're an eyesore, Saber. Disappear along with your Master."

Saber does not even need to answer.
She raises her sword without hesitation.

...Caster disappears.
The battle between the two could not be called a battle.

Caster's magic was supreme, but it did no good against Saber, who has high magic resistance.
Saber nullified every magic Caster used and killed her in one blow.

"I have defeated Caster. Please give me your order, Master."
"Eh? O-Oh. ...Well, we can't do anything here. Let's contact the hospital... no, Kotomine first. We should be able to save the people here that way."

...But we can't save the corpse in front of us.
Caster has disappeared, leaving only her Master's corpse at our feet.
...His death will likely be kept a secret.
Nobody will know what happened to him, and he will disappear from everyone's memory.

"Shirou."
"...I know. There are still four more Masters. We have no time to waste."
"That is a wise decision. I understand your feelings, but this is not the time for sentiment."

Saber turns and starts to walk.

Engraving the sight of the corpse into my mind, I follow.

"Huh?"
Wait...
What was that...?

"Shirou? Why did you stop?"
"Eh... um. I felt someone's gaze on me, like we're being watched. Didn't you feel it?"

"No, I did not feel anything. We have already determined that there is nobody here. Is it not your imagination?"
"Uh... maybe. If you put it that way, I guess that's right. Yeah, it must be just me."

"Then let us hurry. The people should wake up now that Caster is dead. It would be troublesome if somebody saw us here."

...She's right.
Tonight will leave a bad taste in my mouth, but it should put an end to the mysterious coma incidents.
That should be good enough for tonight.

"All right. Let's get out of here and contact Kotomine, then go home and rest."
Saber nods in satisfaction and leaves the temple.


I follow after Saber, even though it's really hard for me to leave this place.
...The man who used to be a Master lies silently in this holy place.
The lead actor has left.
The only ones remaining on the stage are silent corpses.
And...
...Something is devouring the corpses.
No bodies remain.
The wooden floor turns into a bottomless swamp, swallowing up the man's flesh and spilled blood.

It consumes not only the man, but the one who obeyed him.
The soul that was Servant Caster is swallowed into the darkness.
It is not a legitimate flow.
The defeated Servants are to be consumed by the Holy Grail.
If anyone interferes with this balance, it will only bring his own death and destruction.


It cries silently.
It writhes in pain, sobs, exposes itself, and finally consumes the first one.

IT IS NOT ENOUGH

It walks on.
Lacking a voice, it expresses its pain with the whole of its body.

IT IS NOT ENOUGH

There are no words, nor emotion.
It never had those functions in the first place.

IT IS NOT ENOUGH

But it still grieves.
As if...
...It has become aware of its existence for the first time.

It's hot.

Why did it happen?
I went to bed, closed my eyes, and said good night... but in the next instant, my world turned red.

It's hot.

My mom woke me up before the loud noises did.
It was bright even though it was night-time.
My dad held me as he ran through the burning hallway.

It's painful.

I heard my mom's voice behind us.
My dad told me I should be fine by myself.
He patted my head and told me to wait here.
I nodded and did as I was told.

It hurts.

It wasn't much different outside.
My eyes were hurting because everything was red.
That's why I closed them and ran. I wanted to go to a place that wasn't hot.
When I looked back, my house was no longer there.
I probably got punished because I didn't do as I was told to.

My eyes hurt.

I cried as I walked.
I had to go back to my house and wait.
But I didn't know where my house was anymore.
I raised my head which I'd kept hidden with my hands until now.

AndI finally confronted the scene.

The town was burning far away.
The fire that cannot be put out was an event that cannot be redone.
It happened ten years ago.
The fire was far away, not in the sense of distance, but in the sense of time.

"Ahh, guh"
My skin was hurting.
My throat hurt when I breathed in.
My skin creaked by staying alive.
I moved my legs wanting to escape, but something heavy entangled around my legs like shackles.
I knew that it's the presence of death wanting to take me.

"Huh?"
...But it sure was hot.
My nails tearing my throat were discolored.
The air I breathed in stung my burned esophagus.
My eyes abandoned their function, and my brain was being steamed inside my skull.

"Why?"
It's hot.
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot it's hot it's hot it's hot it's hot it's hot it's hot it's hot......!!!!

"Haaa."
I remember now.
This place was hotreally hot.
But it was colddreadfully cold.

It passed the boiling point to reach the freezing point.
The burning blood froze up, and everything in my view was inverted.
Everything was hot.
That's why it was cold.
And still, it was ridiculously hot.

    ...But.
    What was the cause of it?


A black sun was in the sky.
I didn't find it strange that the sun was up during night or that the sun was black.
After all, everything was inverted.
So such things should have been normal.

"AhAhh......!"
But I ran away.
I got scared and ran away.
I wasn't afraid of the raging fires.
Compared to that black shadow, burning up and dying seemed like a human death.
That's why I ran away.
I knew I'd be taken someplace even worse if that thing caught me.

I blankly stared at the sky.
I found out that it was going to rain soon, and my outstretched hand slowly fell to the ground

"Agh."
I slowly open my eyes.
I look around my room, my mind still asleep.

"It was a dream."
I sigh with relief in my futon.
How many years has it been since I sighed with relief after seeing a nightmare?

"...But... that was a vivid dream."
My temples feel hot.
I used to have this nightmare all the time.

...It all happened ten years ago.
Back then, my memories of the event were still terribly vivid, and I would wander through the fire every time I fell asleep.
I thought I would never be able to forget about that day.
That sky, the smell of the burning air, the surrounding wall of fire... Everything was real again once I fell asleep.


That doesn't change even now.
But the vividness should change.
Wounds heal, and memories fade.
For the past few years, all I saw when I had that dream was a field of red.
Why did my dream contain as far as the smell of the burning air?


And what was that?
I don't remember such a thing, nor do I recognize it.
No, first of all, I did not see such a thing.

"!"
...I feel sick to my stomach.
I get dizzy when I try to think about it.
The breaker in my body trips, telling me not to think about it.

"I'll get up. I'll wash my face and clear my mind."
My body is sweaty, probably because of the dream.
My pajamas are damp with my sweat, and my head feels light.

"Huh...?"
...My arm feels heavy.
I realize that I don't even have the strength to get up.

"Heywhat's going on?"
Damn, even talking takes effort.
When I place my hand on my forehead, I realize that it's hot.

"...Wow. Did I catch a cold...?"
I'm surprised.
This is the first time I've caught a cold.
I've had bruises pretty often, but I've never caught a cold.

"...That must be why I had such a dream. My body was hot, so the dream was hot as well."

Oh, that makes sense.
My head is blank, so it's natural for me to dream such a
"Oh."
W-W-W-W-Wait, what am I just lying around for!!!???

"Why!? How can this be!?"
I jump up.
I check inside my futon.
This isn't the time to worry about little things like being sick.
I have to check something far more important.

If "it" happened, I have to go take a bath, bleach and dry the evidence, or it'll hinder my future ability to have a say in anything.
To put it simply, the value of the Emiya Shirou stock in this house will plummet.

"Wait. It doesn't seem like it."
...Good.
There's no one in my futon with me, and there's nothing wrong with my body.

"...It was a dream. Yeah, it had to be."
...I didn't go to school in my sleep, nor would Tohsaka ever want to... um... do it with me.
So it had to be a dream.
I have my pajamas on, and Saber was sleeping in the room next to mine!

"...Yeah. There's no way Saber would miss me leaving the house."
I sigh with relief.
The strength floods out of me, and I fall back to the futon.

"Shirou...? What was that sound?"
I hear Saber's voice from the other side of the door.
...See?
That's all it takes to alert Saber, so that had to be a dream. It's a dream. It's soooooo a dream. I'll never be able to look Tohsaka in the eye again if it's not.

"Shirou?"
Saber comes in.
"Y-Yo. Good morning, Saber."
I try to act calm.

"What is wrong, Shirou? It is not like you to greet me lying down."
"Well, something unexpected happened."

Saber tilts her head in wonder.
Well.
It's great that the whole event was just a dream, but the troubles keep coming.
My body feels heavy, and I can't stand up. How will I make breakfast?

"37.6 degrees. Wow, it's rare for you to catch a cold."
She gives me her diagnosis after looking at the medical thermometer.
...Well, that's about what I expected, but I didn't know a cold could make your body feel so heavy.

"So, does it hurt anywhere else? Does your throat or head hurt?"
"...? No, nothing like that. It's just that my body feels heavy and hot. Is that weird?"

"Hmm... I guess we should just be glad that nothing's hurting.
 Then again, you might not have noticed the pain because you're the type who just deals with it. ...I'll have some other medicines ready, just in case."

Fuji-Nee takes out some cold medicine and cough drops from the first-aid kit.
She's good at treating wounds, but I guess she's not used to treating sick people.

"Thanks, Fuji-Nee. And I'm sorry. I don't think I can cook breakfast."
"Don't say such a stupid thing. Which do you think is more important, food or Shirou? It's good Saber-chan came and got me. I would've been really mad if you tried to make breakfast like that."

She really is mad.
...And she's right. That should have been obvious.

"And you don't have to worry about food. Sakura-chan made some rice porridge for you, so you can eat that when you get hungry."
"What...? Sakura made some rice porridge...?"
...That must mean she's feeling better.

"Are you all right, Sakura? You seemed to be doing worse than me."
"You don't need to worry since I've recovered.
 I wasn't scared at all at night, and I got a good night's sleep. It's all thanks to your treatment."

...That's good to know.
I thought she would take longer to get over the cold, but I'm glad she recovered in one night.

"Ohhh, I forgot about that. Sakura-chan was the one with the cold yesterday, wasn't she?"
"Huh...? That's true... but what about it? Stop making that face."

"Ohhhh. So you did something that made you catch her cold?"
"Huh? What do you mean by that?"
"Oh, you don't get it? Sakura-chan's recovered, right? Then you must've done something. I hear that you recover from a cold if you give it to someone else."

"...?"
I look at Sakura in confusion.
"Oh."
And I finally understand what Fuji-Nee is talking about.

"A-A-A-A-A-A-Are you stupid!? I just gave her some medicine yesterday...! Don't even joke about it, Fuji-Nee! That's rude to Sakura...!"
I can tell that my face is getting red.
My temperature shoots up another degree.

"I'm kidding. I know you're not man enough for that."
"...That's offending as well, but I'm glad the misunderstanding has been cleared up."

"Good, good. Then I'll report to the school about your absence, so you're to rest today. Please take care of Shirou, Saber-chan.
 He'll keep trying to do something if you let him be, so you'd better just tie him to the futon."

"That is my intention. I am to look over him so that he does not escape, and feed him appropriately?"
"Wow, that's a scary way to put it, but you have the right idea. Please do."

Saber nods silently.
...Is it just me, or did I feel a chill run up my spine?

"Well, just listen to what Saber-chan tells you until we get home. I'll buy you something nutritious for dinner, so you're going to rest today and cure that cold of yours."

Fuji-Nee smiles at me while making unreasonable demands.
"...?"
I notice Sakura behind her, looking like she wants to say something.

"We're leaving. Look forward to my souvenir!"
Fuji-Nee waves goodbye and leaves.

"......Phew."
Once I've seen her off, I return to my futon.
I only walked out to the porch, but by the time I get back, I'm so tired that I practically collapse into bed.
...I don't have a bad cold, but my body is dead tired.
I should sleep and get my energy back, or else I won't be able to do anything.

Then.
Even though it's past 7:30, Sakura comes to my room.

"Sakura? It's 7:30 already. You won't make it unless you leave soon."

"......"
Sakura looks down awkwardly.
When I realize she has the same expression as before...

"Um, Senpai. Can I stay here?"
...She raises her head and asks me a question.

"...?"
Staying here means she's not going to school, right?

"...Oh. Are you still a bit sick?"
"......No, the fever's gone. But, um..."
Sakura's words trail off.
...Hm.
She does look a bit pale, and it seems impossible that she could recover in only one night.

"I see, so you were sick after all. But is it all right?
 Don't you have to call the school and let them know?"
"...No. Um, I'm thinking of skipping."
"...?"
She's going to be skipping... school?

"Why? You're sick, so you're not skipping school. You have to stay home if you're not feeling well."

"...Uh. Um, I feel fine."
Sakura hangs her head even more.
"...???"
I don't get it.
What does Sakura want to tell me?

"U-Um. I think you caught the cold because of me."
"What? You actually believe Fuji-Nee's ridiculous story?  Don't worry, it's not true. I take walks during the night, so that must've been it."

"I-I still don't care. ...I'm feeling well, so I want to skip school and take care of you to show my appreciation for what you did for me yesterday...!"
She's so tense that she might shatter if I poke her.

"Hmm."
I guess Sakura feels responsible for my cold.

To be honest, it's relieving to have Sakura here.
Saber has to sleep, so it'll be a big help if she can prepare my medicine and stuff.

"Um, Senpai...?"
"Okay, please do, Sakura."
"Y-You're right. Saber-san is here, so there's nothing I can do here
 Huh, Senpai?"
"Yeah. Please take care of me, Sakura."

"UmYou're talking about me, right?"
"Yeah. Saber has jetlag, so she sleeps during the day. It'll be a huge help if you can cook lunch."
"O-Okay!
 I-I'll do my best, Senpai!"

Her tension gone, Sakura replies with a smile.
...Yeah.
A smile like this suits Sakura.
It's 11AM now.
After eating the rice porridge Sakura made, I feel much better.
My body doesn't feel heavy anymore.
I have no trouble moving, so I should be able to go to school if I feel like it.

But.
As soon as I try to get up, suspecting that my illness was simply caused by malnutrition...

"Oh, no, Senpai! You have to rest until your fever goes away."
...Sakura comes to check up on me.

"Phew."
So...
I'm still resting because Sakura is dead set on looking after me, and to be honest, I'm still feeling a bit sluggish.

After bringing me the rice porridge, Sakura left the room, saying that she had something to do.
Saber is resting in the living room right now.
She was keeping watch in this room, but I had her move to the living room so that I could have a little peace of mind.
She objected, but then relented when I told her it'd only be for today.

"Excuse me, Senpai. How do you feel?"
"I'm getting better thanks to you. My body still feels heavy, but my fever's gone."

"That's good. Then you won't need to take any medicine. All you have to do now is to eat good food and rest."
Sakura goes into the next room and brings in a new futon.

"...? What are you doing, Sakura?"
"I'm getting a new futon. You've been sweating all day, so I thought you might want a clean one."

She lays the futon next to me in a skillful manner.
It doesn't stir up any dust, to my surprise.

"It's ready, Senpai. Please move over here. ...Oh, you need to change before that. I'll go dry this futon, so please get changed while I'm gone."
Sakura prepares new pajamas for me in a flash.


S-She's perfect!
It's not just that she's good at this or that she's attentive.

"I bet this skill is in her genes.  It has to be."
"...? Did you say something, Senpai?"
"I did. I know I shouldn't be saying this, but I'm glad you skipped school today.
 I really do have a better opinion of you now."

"That's natural. It's been almost a year and a half since I started coming here, so I know all about your house."
Sakura puffs with pride.
Her confident expression makes me smile.

"I see. Then I'll leave the futon to you. I'll act as a sick person and do as you say."
"Please do. I'm going to go cut some apples for you after I dry the futon, so look forward to it."
Carrying the futon I've been laying on, Sakura goes out into the hallway.

"Wow, she took all of it in one load."
Her enthusiasm surprises me, and I pick up the new pajamas.

Well.
I should towel myself off, change, and wait in the futon until Sakura comes back.

How much time passed?
Sakura brought me some apples as promised, I gladly ate them, and...
"Geez. You can't push yourself, Senpai."
...Sakura scolded me, and I have to keep lying here even though I'm recovered.

"So, did Saber help?"
"Yes. She said she was tired of doing nothing, so she helped me clean the guest rooms."
"I see. I kind of wanted to see Saber wring a floor cloth.
 Did you two clean the hallway?"

"Yes. We both worked hard. Saber-san was saying something about how it was useful, though."
Sakura laughs, as if she's a bit troubled.
Even though she's used to Saber now, it seems she's still not entirely comfortable around her.

"...Well, thanks for your hard work. But don't push yourself too hard, okay? You just got over a cold. It's hard enough just to treat me, so you don't have to go around cleaning my house."
"That's not true. I spend my mornings here, and you always treat me to dinner. It's perfectly natural for me to clean this house, because..."

I'm part of this family.
Sakura murmurs, as if she wishes for it to come true.

"You're right. Fuji-Nee, Sakura, and I are like a family."
"Eh... Senpai?"

"I'm sorry I was so reserved. There's nothing wrong with a family member nursing me back to health.
 I'd do the same for you if you got sick, no matter how much you complained.
 So it was stupid of me to be reserved."
Reflecting on my actions, I can only apologize.


The conversation stops.
After gasping for a brief second...

"Yes. I'm glad you understand. I think you treasure others too much."
...Sakura smiles happily and adjusts my blanket.


That makes me realize.
Why this house is always clean...
Why even the unused rooms are maintained and feel lively...

Sakura. My friend's younger sister.
The girl I've come to know so well has protected my house even more than me.
Every day has been peaceful for the past year and a half.
...I probably didn't notice because it felt so natural.
But Sakura brought something that Fuji-Nee and I couldn't achieve by ourselves.


I look up at Sakura absent-mindedly.
...Is it because of my fever, or because Sakura's so happy to take care of me?
Looking at Sakura's smile warms my heart and makes me drowsy.

"Hm......"
I really am sleepy.
...It feels good, so I should close my eyes and sleep until noon...

"But Senpai. I really like that part of you."

"What?"
Whatever she just said, it made my heart jump.

"S-Sakura?"
"S-Senpai...!?
 W-Were you awake...!?"
Sakura quickly jumps back.
I can feel myself blushing at her surprised reaction.

"Uh, um, Sakura..."
"I-I didn't say anything! I didn't say anything! Um, I was looking at your face because... um... yes! I was trying to take your temperature!"
Sakura takes out the medical thermometer in a hurry.

"Senpai, here's the thermometer! I'm going to take your temperature, so please open your mouth!"
She must be in a panic, as she tries to pin me with one hand while holding the thermometer in the other.

"Huh?"
I feel something soft.
...Um, I think it's Sakura's breasts rubbing against me.


My brain boils up.
The sensation of a woman almost blows away my sanity.

"Whoa!
 H-Hold on, Sakura!!!"
"Kya!?"
I roll out of the futon using all my might.
I have to get away from Sakura's breano, from Sakura!

"S-Senpai...? Um, I want to take your temperature."
"I-It's fine! I can do that myself, so you stop right there!"

"...? If you say so.
 Here's the thermometer, Senpai."

"No!!!
 Don't give it to me now! Please let me calm down! I'll recall last night's dream and die if you come near me right now!"
I can feel my face burning as I protest.

Then.
"Yesterday's dream?"
I must have acted really strange, as Sakura looks at me dubiously.

"Uhh... um. I had a bad dream.
 I don't want to recall it right now, so please leave me alone. It's not your fault, okay? It's just that I need more training."

"You need... more training...?"
Sakura gapes at me.
...It's only natural. Anyone would be stunned in this situation.

"Um, Senpai. What kind of a dream was it?"
"Ugh"
I-I can't tell her about such a dream...!

"I-It wasn't a big deal. It was just a bit disturbing."
"Senpai."
...Ugh. She's serious now, probably because she's worried about me.
...I can't lie to her, but I can't tell her the truth either.
I
"I'm home."
"Where were you, Shirou!?"
"Where did you go, Senpai!?"
"W-Whoa!?"
I jump back, bumping against the front door.

"No, not 'whoa'! I have told you many times not to go outside by yourself! Worse still, you snuck out while you were sick...!"

"Saber-san's right!
 You wrote that you'd be back at two! Do you know what time it is!? Where were you for the extra two hours!?"

"Uhno, hold on. I understand. I understand why you two are mad, so..."
If you guys will just calm down, I should be able to come up with an excuse...

"No, you do not understand...! I agreed with your decision to go to school yesterday, but I cannot forgive you this time. It seems you are healthy enough. I shall train you until dinner!"
Saber pushes Sakura aside and steps closer.

"Yes, the dojo is cleaned, so please have some matches with Saber-san! I heard how good she is from Fujimura-Sensei, so I'm sure you'll enjoy it!"
Sakura pushes Saber aside and roars at me.

"Uhugh."
...I can't do this. I'll only add fuel to the fire if I say the wrong thing. Saber might even go as far as breaking our contract.
"Where is your reply, Shirou!?"
"Where's your reply, Senpai!?"
"Uh... I'm sorry."
Rattle, rattle.
I hate my front door for blocking my retreat.

"Then let us go at once. Please prepare the first-aid kit, Sakura."
"Please do. Punish him all you want."
The two retreat together in unison.

".........Man. I wonder if I'll be able to eat dinner tonight."
But I don't know what they'll do if I don't go with them.
...I guess I have to atone for my actions in the dojo...
...I guess it can't be helped.
I'll tell her the facts without giving away too much.

"Who was in your dream, Senpai?"
"...Well, um. It was only Tohsaka."
I confess.

"I see. Tohsaka-Senpai came here the other day too, right?"
"Oh... yeah. She treated my wound, but went home right away."

"...Okay. Then I'll be leaving the thermometer here."
Sakura sets the thermometer down and walks to the door with heavy steps.

"Excuse me, but I need to go cook lunch. I'll come get you when it's ready, so rest until then."
She slides the shouji closed behind her.
Her retreating footsteps sound colder than usual.
There's a time and place for honesty.
It burns my face just thinking about the dream, so I'd probably collapse from fever if I actually talk about it.

"Who was in your dream, Senpai?"
"No one was in my dream! See, you forget about your dreams once you wake up, so I don't remember all of it."

"Really? Then I just want to know what you remember about it."

"You idiot...!"
I don't know when Sakura came close to me, but she draws near me.

"I-I'm telling you not to come near me right now!!!! I'm sorry! This subject is off limits, off limits, off limits!"
I wave my hand and roll further down the tatami.

Damn, I really do need more training.
I can usually ignore them, but now every move Sakura makes is catching my attention because of the dream I had...!

"P-Please just leave me alone for a while. D-Don't you have to obey a sick person's requests!?"
Sitting in the corner of the room, I protest to Sakura.

"......Phew. All right, I won't force it out of you.
 I do want to know about it, but your fever might get worse if I push you."
Sakura backs down.

"I'm sorry. I'm glad you understand how I feel."
I quickly climb back into my futon.

"Well, Senpai. I need to go cook lunch, so please excuse me.
 I'll come get you when it's done, so please rest until then."
"Oh, okay. You do that."

"Sure. I'm sorry I asked you a weird question. I'll make some hot udon for lunch."
She closes the shouji.
Sakura leaves for the living room with a warm smile.
"Thanks for the meal."
"Thanks for the meal."
We bow together.
"You're welcome. Wow, you both ate everything in your bowls."

Sakura starts to clean up after our lunch.
There are three bowls and condiments on the table.

"Oh, I'll clean up. I'm feeling better, so please, at least let me do this."
"Really? Then please do, as a test to see if you've recovered. I'll do the dishes, so please take the dishes to the kitchen and clean the table."

Tying on an apron, Sakura heads to the kitchen.
Well, I should carry these bowls and the pot in there.

"Are you all right, Shirou? I heard that your fever has broken, but you still look pale."
"Huh? Do I look that bad?"

"...Hm. No, your face just looks pale.
 You have a shortage of magical energy, the lifeline for a magus. I noticed no problems during the battle last night, but that temple might have been set up to drain magical energy."

"Hmm."
...Now that she mentions it, something was indeed strange at the Ryudou Temple.
Everyone in there was weakened.  It's possible that Caster set up a boundary field to suck the lifeforce from anyone inside.

"Well, I'm feeling better, so there's no problem. My magical energy should return if I get some nourishment. My capacity isn't that large, so it should be back to normal once I eat dinner."

"Geez. I will not inquire any further if you say so. ...Sakura is right. It seems you tend to make light of yourself."
Saber starts stacking the bowls.

"I should hand these to Sakura, correct? I will take the pot as well, so please wipe the table, Shirou."
Saber goes to the kitchen without waiting for my reply.

"Should I put the bowls here, Sakura?"
"Saber-san? Oh, yes. Please put the dirty dishes there."
"I see. By the way, Sakura, lunch was very delicious. Please accept my thanks."
"Ahaha, I have a lot to learn. Senpai's still the best when it comes to rice porridge and udon."

"......"
I can hear friendly conversation from the kitchen.
"Oh. So Sakura is getting along with Saber."
Maybe it's because they helped each other clean this morning.
Either way, it's a good thing that they're getting along.

"Well, I should prepare some tea."
I place the tea leaves and the teapot on the table.

It's almost one o'clock.
It's a good time to take a break, so
"Oh, right."
There should be some dorayaki, bean-jam pancakes, that I bought on a whim.
In my efforts to keep Fuji-Nee from finding them, I hid them so well that I forgot about them myself.

"Senpai? What are you doing, opening the refrigerator?"
"Well, I'm thinking of repaying you just a bit."

I look in the very back, behind all the vegetables.
Thanks to years of practice in hiding things from Fuji-Nee, I hide snacks where I can find them before they pass the expiration date.

"...Huh? Why is there an Edomaeya bag in the vegetable compartment?"
Sakura stares at the bag with surprise and expectation.

By the way, Edomaeya is a stand that sells dorayaki, taiyaki, and takoyaki.
The students at my school love this place because of its low prices and huge servings.
And to add, Sakura really loves the food there.

"T-There's a lot in there. I thought you had potatoes in there."

"That's how I camouflaged it. I figured I'd forget about it, so I put it where it'd be found when we ran out of carrots."
I take out the time-bomb guarding against Fuji-Nee.

"So let's eat these as refreshments. Oh, or should we make this a mid-afternoon snack?
 We just ate, so you two must be full."
I put the paper bag onto the tray so I won't forget about it.

"Huh...? A-Are you full, Senpai?"
"I am. Lunch was really good, so I ate about two meals worth. I think I won't get hungry for a while."

"I-I thought so too!
 T-Then let's save the fun for later and"
"Are you saving them for later? I am still hungry."

"Oh. Wow, you've got room for more? That's amazing, considering that you ate as much as Sakura."
"I am more interested in the food. Sugar is a source of energy, and I have never heard of 'dorayaki' before."

...I see.
A Japanese snack like this must be foreign to Saber, who is from a Western culture.

"Fair enough. Then here's some for dessert. There's more than enough for you, so we can keep the leftovers for a snack this afternoon."
"OhSenpai. Pardon me for asking, but how many did you buy...?"

"Hm? I think I bought five. Each of us gets one, and the remaining two can be shared or given to anyone who wants them."

"I see. According to that calculation, I can eat a maximum of three?"
"Yeah. But you'll get heartburn if you eat so many sweets. ...Well, I guess you can handle three."

I return to the living room with the tray.
To thank the two girls for doing the dishes, I prepare the dorayaki along with some tea.

"We are done. So that is dorayaki, Shirou?"
"Huh?"
Then.
Saber is sitting there and staring at the tray, apparently ready to eat.

Sakura quietly sits down beside her.

"Sakura? Is something wrong?"
"No, nothing's wrong. I'm full, just like you."
"...?"
I don't understand, but I go ahead and pour some tea for the three of us.

"Itadakimasu."
She bows and reaches for the dorayaki.
The match is over in an instant.
After taking the tentative first bite, Saber quickly digs in with more enthusiasm.
Undeterred by its sweetness, she quickly finishes her first dorayaki.

"I see. It is a simple dessert, but it goes well with the tea."
She takes an elegant sip of tea and reaches for the second dorayaki.
Sakura watches nervously.

"......"
...Hold on.
Is Sakura uneasy because...?
"Hm. This is certainly more than just dessert."
Saber quickly finishes her second one and reaches out for the third.

"Hold on, Saber. Can you stop at two?"
"...? I do not mind, since I was only going to eat the excess share. Are you going to eat the rest, Shirou?"

"Sakura and I will eat them. I'll eat one, Sakura will eat one, and the last one..."
I take the third dorayaki and break it in half.
"...Sakura and I will share it. You can handle this, right?"
"Y-Yes, of course! I can eat it right now!"

As I thought.
Sakura was reserved for some reason.
Nobody would mind if she ate one or two dorayaki.

"Well, let's eat too. I got hungry watching Saber."
"I-I agree! I can eat this easily!"

Sakura reaches out for the dorayaki.
Although not as much as taiyaki, Sakura loves dorayaki.

".........But..."
I'm glad she likes the food I bought. But...
I hope she doesn't regret it in front of the scale later on...

My body is almost fully healed by the time we finish eating.
The fever probably came from fatigue, so half a day's rest did the trick.

"So, will you be using the afternoon to train?"
I nod back.

Even though I only just recovered, we can't waste any time.
Skill in magic doesn't improve after one day of training, but physical skill should be different.
It won't hurt to train until dinner.
I should laze around after a meal.
Your body needs to use its energy for digestion, and besides, tea tastes good after a meal.
I know it's shameful to leave the two of them to do the dishes, but they have a good atmosphere going in the kitchen.

Since they have no common interests to talk about, they are doing the dishes together as a way of bonding.

"Wow, they're getting along well."
I leisurely watch what's going on in the kitchen.
There's some program for housewives on TV.
In this peaceful atmosphere, I fully enjoy a short rest after our meal.

My body is almost fully healed by the time I finish resting.
The fever was probably the result of fatigue, so even half a day's rest did the trick.

"So, will you be using the afternoon to train?"
I nod back.

Even though I just recovered, we can't waste any time.
Magical skill doesn't improve after only one day, but physical skill should be different.
It won't hurt to train until dinner.
"Oh yeah"
I forgot about it because of all the things that happened this morning, but I did make a promise with Ilya.
...Well, it wasn't really a promise, but I'd be really dishonest if I don't go, as I'm the one who asked her if we could see each other again.

"Saber and Sakura are..."
They're doing the dishes together.
If I tell them I'm going out, they'll either stop me or insist on coming along.

If I'm going to go see Ilya, I should do it alone.
I feel bad, but I'll just leave a note and sneak out

"Phew."
I managed to sneak out.
I left them a note saying, "Going to buy stuff for dinner. Be back in an hour," so they shouldn't be too worried.

"Hm... So she's not here, as I thought."
There's no one in the park.
Even with the apartments looming overhead, this place is so cold that it feels like it'll start snowing at any moment.

"...Well, I don't know what I'd talk about even if she were here."
I sit on the bench.
Setting the grocery bag down, I look up at the dark sky.
...It seems the gift I bought at the shopping district went to waste.


I stare at the sky absent-mindedly.
It must be because this place is surrounded by buildings.
Only a tiny square of sky is visible, and it seems farther away than usual.

"It's cold."
I can see my breath.
The cold, dry air is freezing, and I wouldn't be surprised even if it started snowing.

"Well, I should go home."
I grab the grocery bag and get up.
It's past two o'clock.
I have to leave now if I'm going to be home in time.

"Huh?"
My legs freeze.
They won't move.
They don't even budge, no matter how hard I try


My vision blurs.
No, that's an understatement.
My vision is broken.
My eyes have bulged into my skull, and I have no sense of distance.

"Ah"
I realize that I'm in the worst situation possible.
It feels like my body has been turned into stone.
My nerves are disconnected, leaving me detached from the world.
It's like I'm watching the world through a camera, controlling myself in a video game.

"Sa... ber"
I'll be killed.
It was a mistake to go outside alone.

I can't even see my attacker's face, let alone move, and
"Did I surprise you?
 You were completely defenseless, so I had to tease you."
Um, I'm being teased by this mischievous girl?

"Oh, you're back to normal. I guess contacting you through vision isn't that strong."
"Il"

She appears from behind me.
She's smiling, probably because she was already here and was watching me from behind.

"But you're no good if you can't dispel magic using your own powers. Your future looks gloomy if outside factors are the only things that can dispel you."
She lectures me.
But her words aren't coming into my brain.

"Ilya! What are you doing!? Surprise attacks are unfair, even if we're both Masters!"

"Hey, that wasn't a surprise attack. I was sitting next to you for a while. But you didn't notice me, and then you made it worse by getting ready to leave. That was your own fault, Shirou."
"...!? Y-You were sitting next to me this whole time?"

"Yeah, I was hiding a bit. But you're too careless. You didn't notice my presence, and you were captivated by a spell that merely uses direct magical energy contact. You're a Master, so you should keep a better watch on your surroundings."
Ilya warns me, utterly amazed.

"Ohyeah. You're right."
She seems so much like a teacher that I find myself nodding.

"It's good if you understand.
 So, what's going on today? You're empty inside right now, but you don't have Saber with you. If you're trying to rest, wouldn't it be safer to do it at home?"

"Huh? Well, I didn't come here to rest.
 Well, you're right that not bringing Saber was careless of me."

"Right? I couldn't leave you alone because you seemed so odd. I wasn't supposed to talk to you after yesterday, but I'll make an exception for today."
"...?"
Ilya's saying something strange.
After all, I came to this park because...

"So, why were you just sitting here?
 You would've been dead if I came here as a Master."
"Well, I just came here to see you.
 You told me yesterday that we could meet again."

"What?"
Oh, she's surprised.
...Well, it's not like it was an official promise.

"Why...? You came to see me, even though I told you I'll be trying to kill you?"
"That's your choice. It's not mine. I just want to talk to you, not fight. And in any case"

Ilya said she'd kill me, but she just let a chance go by.
She could've really done it if she'd kept her spell on me.
As she didn't do so, I don't want to fight her.

"Masters don't fight during daytime, right?
 Then let's forget about it for now. I just came here to see you. Do you want to kill me more than you want to talk with me?"

"Eh? T-That's an unfair question. I have to do both. It's fun to talk with you, but I can't forgive you. So I can't choose just one."

Ilya hangs her head and mumbles.
She looks serious, like she's actually suffering rather than just being troubled.

"...I see. Then I don't care. I won't ask you to choose one."
"Oh... B-But I..."
"I know. But since we're both here, let's talk.
 I brought a gift for you today, so we'll fight some other time."

I take out a bag of taiyaki.
They cooled off while I was waiting for Ilya, but they're still a bit warm.

"Here's the offering. I'll give you these, so please let me go this time."
I hold out the taiyaki.
"Oh"
Ilya hesitates, but then takes them and nods.

I'm not too sure what we talked about after that.
We talked about meaningless things:
What she likes to eat, what she doesn't like to eat, how she likes birds and hates cats, how she likes snow and hates the cold, how she wants to play but can't, and how she doesn't like her maids but wants to like them.

Ilya looks happy just to be talking.
She is sitting on the bench, eating the taiyaki, and swinging her legs.
...She looks like a child waiting for her father's return.

"I see. So you didn't come to this town by yourself?"
"No, I came with Sella and Leysritt. I don't need people to keep an eye on me, but I do need people to take care of my place, right?"

...So Ilya came to Japan with two maids.
Are they staying at a hotel or something?

"What? Are you curious? Do you want to know where I live?"
"Eh... yeah, I'm curious. You keep popping up at unexpected times, but what would I do if an emergency happens and I don't know where you live?"

Even if she gets injured and asks me for help, I won't be able to if I don't know that.
I'll rest a little easier if I know where she lives

"All right. You're special. If you want to know that badly, I'll tell you."
Then.
Ilya stands up and places her hand on my forehead.

"Whoahey, Ilya..."
"Just be quiet. You'll enter some other place if you resist me too hard. It's troublesome to return things to normal if that happens."
She glares at me.
"Ohokay."
Under that kind of pressure, I can only nod obediently.

"That's a good boy. Then close your eyes. And don't look around too much, okay? Even though I'm transferring you, you'll get motion sickness because the view is someone else's."

"!"
Ilya places her forehead onto mine.
I'm surprised, but I close my eyes.
At that moment...

My vision accelerates and expands.
No, was it my consciousness that expanded?
The next thing I know, I'm looking down at an unfamiliar scene.

"Can you see it? I transferred your vision to my forest."

Ilya's voice echoes in my head.
I can't reply, nor nod back.
This "vision" is the only thing allowed for me.
I'm one of the trees in the forest.
It's natural that my body doesn't move.
My body has been turned into a tree in an instant.

"Did you memorize the route? Then I'll transfer you to the castle wall now."

The scene changes.
My vision is the only sense I have.
I still exist, but I can't feel myself.

I'm a wall now.
I can sense my limbs, but there are no limbs for me to move. I have a body that can move at will, yet I can't move it.

"Leysritt. I cannot find Ilyasviel-sama. Do you know where she may be?"
"......No. Ilya should be somewhere."
"Leysritt. Please do not refer to our lady so crudely. Ilyasviel-sama is not like us. Have you forgotten our mission?"

"Sella is Ilya's teacher. I'm to dress Ilya with Heavens Feel, the third dress."
"Correct. It seems even your poor memory can retain that."

"......I didn't forget. ...But Ilya hates wearing that. So I don't like it."

"...I understand that as well. But we need her to wear it when the time comes. We were made for that purpose.
 She must be prepared as well."

"......Sella."
"What is it, Leysritt?"
"......Don't you get tired?"
"Not at all!"

...I hear two identical maids talking.
When I realize those two are the maids Ilya was talking about...

...I finally return to my body.

"How was it? That was some great transformation magic, right?"
"UhUh..."

...I hold my mouth and bear my nausea.
I feel sick, suddenly feeling the realism of my body.

"Ilya... What was that?"
"It's transfer of consciousness. I moved your vision into some other object."

"There's a nerve going from your eyes to your brain, right? I connected that nerve to something other than your eyes.
 You were getting information from the trees in my forest instead of your eyes."

"......Hm. So it's not that I became the tree, but I received their vision and mistakenly thought I was one?"

"Oh, I thought you were dense, but you're actually pretty bright.
 Yes, that's right. That was magic to change the input while leaving the equipment called human alone.
 It's a big deal to change someone into a tree, but it's still in the realms of magic to connect one's consciousness to a tree. Far-sight and possession are an application of this magic."

"......I see. But that's pretty impressive stuff. I couldn't do anything when you transferred me to the tree. Couldn't you also use it to nullify your opponent?"

"Yes. Our specialty is in flow and transfer of power.
 For example, Tohsaka magi can transfer their magical energy into jewels without diluting its purity.  Using that same technique, they can also transfer someone's consciousness.
 If there's an enemy they want to seal, they can nullify him by transferring his consciousness into a jewel or an immobile doll."

"But the success rate of transferring someone's consciousness is so low that even we, the ones specialized in transfer, won't use it as an attack."

"The one I did to you was an exception. You didn't resist, and that forest is mine. It's normally much harder to connect things."

"And your consciousness will be forced to return if the original body is stimulated in any way.
 The body will call its consciousness back when it senses danger, even if the consciousness is unaware."

"That's what happened to you just now.
 You couldn't do anything when your mind was in the tree, but your body called you back when I shook it."

"...Hm. So this is something like a dream?"
You can never wake up from a dream, no matter how hard you try.
Dreams usually end when morning comeswhen the body wakes up out of habit.

"Hmm, it's a bit different. You can wake up from a dream using your will.
 But that's why transferral is not fit for offense. It's more for self-protection."

"If you transfer your consciousness to your familiar or a doll that can move, you can safely pursue magic."

"......So your consciousness just returns to your original body even if an enemy destroys your familiar?"

"Yes. Magi who transfer their minds usually hide their original bodies in a safe place.
 In cases like this, you need to watch out when you transfer into a familiar with its own soul."

"When you transfer your consciousness into something with a proper chain of command, the initiative is completely held by them."

"So even if you transfer into humans or animals, you can only occupy a corner of their brain and observe what they see. They will serve as a camera, not a remote-controlled robot."

"Moving your consciousness into a living thing with its own will is more like reincarnation than transfer.
 That alone is a great magic, so no ordinary magus would be able to do it."

...Reincarnation.
Magic to create an offspring with your soul in it after you die.
Some magi have achieved that goal, but I hear that reproducing a soul is difficult.

Even if you start over from the moment of birth, if you cannot inherit all the power of your previous self, you are a copy, not a reincarnation.
A copy is degraded by its very nature.
Therefore, a copied magus is inferior to his previous self.

"If you want to transfer yourself into a living thing, you can make a familiar without a soul.
 But the soulless familiars used today are weak. It's just like controlling a doll filled with cotton.
 They're only useful as messengers."

"And even if you transfer your consciousness into a familiar or doll, you will disappear if your original body grows old and dies.
 It's not immortality."

"The only eternal things in this physical world are souls.
 But nobody can keep souls by themselves. A soul cannot stay in this world without a body, and it will be destined with 'eventual death' once it obtains a body.
 Well, it just means that's the limit of magic by Einzbern and Tohsaka."

Then.
A bell rings the time.
The clock in the park points at three.
I guess it's already been an hour.

"Oh... I have to get going. Are you going home too?"
"Hm? Yeah, I should be heading home."

Ilya nods and walks to the middle of the park.

"...Okay. I shouldn't say this, but..."
The white girl asks me...

"Will you come see me again tomorrow, Shirou?"
...As if she knows I'm going to refuse.


You idiot.
I don't even need to answer.

"Of course I'll come tomorrow. You showed me your house, so it's my turn next."
"Okay! Then I'll be sure to call out to you first tomorrow!"

Ilya runs off.
Under the cloudy sky...
The white-haired girl looks like a fairy.
...I don't feel sick, so I guess I'll go outside.
I'm sure we haven't bought stuff for dinner, so I'll go to the shopping district.

"Saber and Sakura are..."
They're doing the dishes together.
I don't want to interrupt them, so I'll leave a note and sneak out

"Phew."
I managed to sneak out.
I left them a note saying "Going to buy stuff for dinner. Be back in an hour," so there's no problem.
I bet they won't get mad at me if I buy them some snacks.

"Phew..."
I leave the supermarket with bags full of food.
I didn't find any good deals, but I still bought a lot.
Sakura's going to be staying over for a while, so we need the extra groceries.

"We had udon for lunch, so maybe I'll make some meat for dinner."
I stop my feet.
"...?"
Someone's tugging at my shirt from behind.

"What's going on...?"
I turn around in wonder.
There...
...Stands a young girl with silver hair.

"W-What!?"
I quickly jump back.
I ready myself while the girl just stands there and smiles.

"...?"
I don't feel any hostility from the girl.
"I'm glad you're alive, Onii-chan."
She looks at me with a big smile.

"Wha"
...I'm sure of it. This girl is Berserker's Master.
She's the master of the monster who wounded me.
The girl of the family of magi who started this war, the family which my father betrayed.
Why is she here in the shopping district in broad daylight?

...It must be because the priest's story was so vivid. This girl doesn't feel like a stranger to me.
That's why...
"Ilya...?"
"Huh?"
...I blurt out her name without knowing what it means.

"Ohsorry, that's wrong...!
 Ilyayeah, it's Ilyasviel...!
 I-I'm sorry for getting it wrong...!"

I quickly apologize.
It doesn't matter if she's Berserker's Master or that she's the daughter of the Einzbern family.
It's just that...
I can't ignore that sad look on her face.

"......"
The girl is glaring at me, maybe because I shortened her name.
"OhI didn't mean to make you mad. I just blurted it out."

"......Tell me your name."
"What?"
"Tell me your name, Onii-chan. It's unfair that I don't know your name."

Oh, she's right.
Ilyasviel told me her name, but I haven't told her mine yet.

"I'm Shirou. Emiya Shirou."
"Emiyashiro? That's a strange name, Onii-chan."
"No. Emiya is my last name, and Shirou is my first name. If it's hard to say it, just call me Shirou."
I correct her pronunciation.


I point at the girl right at her nose, and she stands there in surprise.


It's too late to take it back, even if I wanted to.
The girl looks like she's about to cry, and...

"...Shirou, Shirou, huh? Yeah, I like the name.
 It's simple, but it sounds pretty. It suits you, Shirou.
 I'll forgive you for what you just did!"
...She embraces my arm.

"What!? H-H-Hold on, Ilyasviel! What are you doing...!?"
"No, you can call me Ilya, Shirou! I'm calling you Shirou, so this is fair!"

"Whawell, that's easier to say, but hold on!!!"
I try to shake her off, but Ilya just squeals with delight.

"...!"
This is bad. My neighbors might spread a bad rumor about me like this.

"Damn, what do you want...!? Do you want to fight me right now...!?"
I pull her off by force.

...Oh.
Ilya looks unhappy.

"W-What? Don't think making faces will change anything! I don't know what your intention is, but I'm a Master. You can't defeat me that easily"
I glare at her, groceries in hand.
...But she only watches me in wonder.

"......Um, Ilya?"
"Yeah!? What, Shirou!?"
"Ugh."

She's different from before.
...Well, she was laughing then too, but it's not the same. Could it really be?
"...Ilya. You didn't come here to fight...?"
I ask timidly.

"What? Do you want to be killed?"
"!"
Her glare sends a chill down my spine.
No matter how young this girl may be, she is the strongest Master.
She laughs innocently, but she can also become the ruthless Master.

"...Hmm. I don't get it, but I don't mind if you say so. I don't mind going ahead with my plans. Do you want to die along with Saber?"
"...Are you kidding me?  Of course not! I don't want to die, and I don't want to fight you here."

"Right? Masters can't fight during daytime. You don't have Saber with you, and I don't have Berserker with me."

"...You're right. Then why did you come here? Did we just meet up by chance?"
"It's not chance. I snuck out under Sella's nose especially for you. You better be grateful."
Ilya is inflated with pride.


I feel dizzy.
Every time I think she turns into a cruel Master, she returns to being the innocent girl.
I can't tell which is the real Ilya.

"...All right. So you came to see me.
 But you have no intention of fighting me. Am I correct?"
"Yup. I came to talk to you. I've waited all this time, so I can, right?"

I don't know what she means by "all this time," but it seems Ilya really did come just to talk to me.

"Or do you not want to? ...I'll go home if you don't. I really don't want to go home, but you'll hate me if I make you do something you don't want."
Ilya looks straight into my eyes.

"!"
...From a Master's point of view, it's dangerous to associate with Ilya. If Saber were here, she'd make her objections clear.


...But I can't just walk away from her when she's making a face like that.
I know it's reckless, thoughtless, and rash, but...

"I don't mind talking with you. Actually, I wanted to."

"All right! Then let's go over that way! I found a small park over there earlier!"
Ilya starts running.

"Come on, come on! I'll leave you behind if you don't hurry!"
She twirls about as she runs.

"Well, I guess it can't be helped."
I accept this event and follow after Ilya.
She called me Shirou.
Then I should treat her like a normal girl, not like a Master.

The park is empty.
Nobody is playing in the sand pit or on the swings.
It feels desolate, but I sit down on a bench with Ilya.

...I think this must look weird to other people.
Ilya's a foreigner, so we don't look like siblings, and our ages are too far apart to be friends.

"...So. What do you want to talk about, Ilya? You came to me, so do you have something you want to ask me?"

"Why? I have nothing I want to ask you."

Well.
How do I respond to that?

"...Ilya. You're the one who wanted to talk.
 So why do you say you have no business with me? You wouldn't come if that were true, right?"
"O-Oh, really? We can't talk if we don't have business?"

"Uhh... that's not what I meant. Sorry, I put it in the wrong way. We can talk even if we have no business. I guess it's better to talk without purpose.
 But... honestly, I don't know you really well, so I don't know what I should talk about. I don't know what you like, or anything like that. You don't want me asking you about something you'd rather not talk about, right?"

"Y-You're right... but what should I ask? Will you promise me you won't get mad even if I ask you anything?"
"I'll try. I'm your Onii-chan, so I'll try to act mature."
"I see. Then Shirou, do you like me?"

"WHA!?"
W-W-W-W-W-What the hell is she asking!?

"Oh, you're a liar! You said you won't get mad, but you're mad!"
"Hey, anyone would be shocked by that question! Y-You shouldn't be asking that question when you've already attacked me!"

"Hey, that was different! You jumped in the way, even though you were weak! It's not my fault!"

"It is your fault! You were ready to kill from the beginning! So why are you talking about me liking you and whatnot!?"
Ilya quivers up and shuts up.

"...Oh."
...Crap.
Look what I did, right after I said I'd forget about us being Masters.

"...Um, Ilya?"
"......I asked because it's important to me. You're an idiot, Shirou. You still want to talk big, even though you would've died if it weren't for me."
Ilya looks down, her shoulders shaking.

"......Man."
I guess it can't be helped.
I'm the one who started this whole Master conversation, I'm the older one here, and Ilya is a girl.

"Ahem. Um, Ilya..."
I prepare myself for what I have to say.

"I don't mind it anymore. My wound healed up, and you let me go.
 ...But if it still bothers you, then I won't bring it up again. Is that all right?"

"Oh... yeah. Um, so you're not mad, Shirou...?"
"I don't know why, but I'm not mad.
 I want to talk to you more now."

Ilya was about to cry, but now she smiles.

Seeing her smile makes me happy as well.
She doesn't feel dangerous to me.
Then I should stop thinking like a Master.
I guess I'll have to talk with her, just like she wants

My conversation with Ilya lasts for an hour.
Ilya listens to my ordinary stories and meaningless talks.

...Since when did it start feeling painful?
Ilya is an innocent girl.
The fact that she's a Master and that she has no doubt in that fact...
I think it's sad that she goes into battle with no fear.


A family of magi called Einzbern.
This young girl that is sent out as the greatest Master as a result of their thousand-year-old history.

If that is Ilya's goal, then...

"Ilya. Can I ask you something?"
"What?"
"Do you recognize the name Emiya Kiritsugu?"
...I have to ask her this.


The air freezes.
It is an emotionless silence.

"No. I don't know of such a guy."
...Her silver hair flutters.
Ilya gets up from the bench and twirls about like a fairy.

"It's getting late. Berserker wakes up at night, so I have to get going now."

Ilya waves goodbye.

"Yeah, I should go home too."
I get up.
This is all the rest I'm getting.
We'll have to fight as enemies again once the sun sets.

But...
"Can I talk with you again, Ilya?"
...I naturally ask this question.

"U-Um, I don't know. Do you want to see me again, Shirou?"
"Of course. I wouldn't ask you if I didn't want to."
"......! Okay, then I'll come again tomorrow if I feel like it. Don't expect too much and keep waiting, okay?"
She runs out of the park.

...But.
She suddenly stops and...

"I was lying. I do know of him."

"Ilya?"
"...I was given birth to this world to win the Holy Grail War. My goal is to kill you and Kiritsugu."

She sprints off.
Ilya leaves without turning around.
I watch her go until I can't see her anymore.
The Ryudou Temple.
The land is desolate after Caster has disappeared.
The monks, who have collapsed from an unknown cause, have left the mountain to leave the temple empty.
The gate is shut firmly, so neither worshippers nor monks can enter the place.

"Damn, what a stench. This is a real stinker."
A voice echoes through the place that should be desolate.
A lean blue figure glows in the moonlight.
The sturdily-built man with the crimson spear is a Servant called Lancer.

"Oh, wow. The boundary field is still here, even though Caster's dead?
 ...No, this is too crude.  Her work was much more polished than this."

Lancer looks around the temple.
The red lance is in his hand.
His objectives are to gain information and to keep watch.
He is unwilling, but he cannot disobey his Master's command.
It is his policy to follow any command given to him, and to accomplish the mission.
That is why he has fought several Servants and ended up in a draw with each.

As long as he serves this Master, Lancer will never start a fight.
This is no exception, and he is to investigate the Ryudou Temple.
If that is the case, why is his lance in his hand?
His weapon, his Noble Phantasm, can be summoned whenever needed.
There is no need for him to hold his lance when there is no enemy before him.

"Damn, what a racket.  I thought Caster was the master of wind, but maybe she used water instead.  This place is crawling with leeches and spiders"

He walks through the temple.
He seems too vulnerable and defenseless to be a Servant.
He is so defenseless that ifthis is an ifthere is another Servant here, he would be attacked and killed in an instant.

"But who knows?  Maybe the head has been replaced.
 There's nothing here but rotten insects. It's your habitual practice to nest on deserted houses."

Lancer doesn't stop cursing.
The blue spearman gives a speech as if to persuade a person who is not here.

"But there's one big one.
 I don't know where it was born, but it looks like it was raised by beasts deep within a mountain. And what is this, a smell of sand?
 Hah, I thought you were a big spider, but you turned out to be a dirty sandworm.
 Why the hell should I have to come and investigate a wretch like youwhoa!"

The silver lights are deflected.
Three rays of light streak forth from the darkness, only to be struck down by Lancer's lance.

The deflected lights are daggers called "Dark".
They are not a weapon to be held onto and to slash with, but a weapon to be thrown.
These daggers were thrown with great speed at Lancer's eyes and throat.

"You're pretty good. But don't do that again, sandworm.
 I don't like getting killed without a greeting first, and more importantly, it will be fatal for you."

The blue figure stands firm before the darkness.
In the darkness in front of Lancer is...

...A laughing skull, white as the moon.

The battle starts without a signal.
Lacking human words, the white skull attacks Lancer with an inhuman shriek, and Lancer meets his assault without twitching a brow.

The skull tosses daggers with a precision rivaling that of Archer.
Thirty are thrown from close range as he runs through the darkness.
But Lancer easily repels every one.

"Ki?"
The skull comes to an abrupt stop.
It is abnormal.
No matter how great a spearman Lancer may be, he could not possibly block all the daggers.
Furthermore, he is using a long lance.
How are the daggers, fired accurately in between his swings, all deflected?

"Hey. Don't tell me that's all you can do."
Lancer's presence changes.
He stops, and his hostility changes to a clear intent to kill.

"Then this is it.
 I don't know who you are... well, I guess I'll at least take off that mask of yours."

Daggers flash though the darkness.
A rapid barrage is unleashed as a counter to Lancer's charge!

But he blocks even that.
Although the daggers cannot be perceived, he turns them aside with a slight swing of his spear.


The skull is the one shivering.
Unable to speak human language, he can only swallow his scream and watch as the enemy comes to take his life
", Kii!"
He throws a dagger at the small opening in between Lancer's strikes...!

"Kii...!"
The skull's mask trembles.
Lancer blocks the dagger, turns the spear in a full circle, and smacks his opponent's chin from below.

Defense and counter.
He performs both actions in one motion.
Already committed to his attack, the skull cannot respond to such a maneuver.

The white mask falls from his face.
Lancer does not keep attacking.
His order is merely to observe his foes.
Even if this is a sure chance to kill, he has no authority to attack.

"You idiot. I told you projectile weapons are useless against me. You're the one who didn't listen to my warning."

Lancer readies his lance again and regards his enemy, who is now hiding his face.
A black body.
A right hand covered in bandages.
A face still hidden by the darkness.

No.
His face is flat and utterly featureless.

"GiyoU SAw My FaCe, Lan, cer."
"I'm about to. I'm sure you're a Servant, so let me check out which hero you are."
"Kuh. I sEE, YOu HavE A bINd. No WONdeR YoU, DiD, Not KilL, me."

The Servant retreats further into the shadows.
He still has the Dark in his hand, and his hostility is still emitting.

"Don't even try. It's my nature, but projectile attacks from a visible opponent aren't effective against me. You can't hurt me using a projectile unless it's some great Noble Phantasm."
"...! I sEE, PRoteCtIon AgaiNst ArrOws. ...Kuku, as EXpecTed frOm a HeRo WIth A nAMe. YoU Are nOT LIKe mE."

The shadow wavers.
The black Servant sinks down to the ground, then springs up in an instant as he throws another dagger.

If his leap is that of a deer, his movements are those of a spider, snake, or scorpion.
Even while keeping his face hidden, this Servant is as fast as Lancer when it comes to retreat.
But Lancer's charge is still the fastest.
It is a disgrace to take even a minute to corner his enemy.

"DamnI know I destroyed his throat, but he's persistent. It doesn't seem like it's healed, so he must be drugged"

The enemy glides across the water like a spider, and Lancer pursues him.
In contrast, water sprays from his footsteps, but his speed is far greater.

"...Hmph. If I'd known the pain wouldn't stop him, I would've cut his joints. I put that off since it doesn't work on other opponents, but"

It is fatal for a human body to be cut at the joint, where the main arteries lie.
If the arteries are severed, death from severe bleeding will quickly follow.
But that is only in normal combat.
You cannot expect a Servant, a heroic spirit, to die from excessive bleeding.

As their lifeforce is magical energy, cutting their arteries does not have much effect.
The loss of a limb is another story, but cutting off a Servant's limb is a difficult task.
Doing so will likely cost you your own head in the process.

"...Hashish, huh? I bet a heroic spirit who relies on drugs doesn't have healing powers. I'll end this fight with my next attack"
Water splashes with lightning speed.
His next attack will strike in two more seconds.
He tenses, then thrusts at his fleeing enemy's left leg
"!"
With a start, Lancer jumps back from the water's surface.

Water explodes upward.
No, something beneath the water is snarling.
Black tendrils snake out of the water, reaching for the spearman.
Is it because this creature dwells underwater?
It seems to resemble a deep-sea monster from ancient times.

"What... the...?"
Lancer has nowhere to run.
He instantly carves all his runes on the bottom of the lake to create a boundary field, but it is easily penetrated.

The dark tentacles are closing in on all sides, and his territory is shrinking by the second.
The protection using all his Runes, which can even block a great Noble Phantasm, does not even slow down the penetration.
Watching Lancer
"WHaT iS WrOng, LAncEr? It wILl SwaLLow yOu if yOU Do nOT MoVe."
Assassin sneers.

But even the sneering spider is no exception.
It seems these tendrils must engulf anything they can reach, as the spider does not approach the dark water.
He knows that if he draws near, they will take interest in new prey.

"BuT I wILL nOt aLLow THat. I MuST KiLL You. I nEEd mOrE EXperIenCE. I sHaLL KiLL YoU To aDD tO mY iNtELLigeNCe."

The spider's dagger glimmers.
The weapon about to be released is just a projectile.
But is it not meaningless?
Even though Lancer is surrounded by ghastly limbs, projectiles are meaningless against Lancer.

"You don't give up, do you? Well, I can understand why you feel that way."
Lancer observes the ghastly limbs around him.
He was lured quite far in, but it's only about thirty meters to the opposite shore.
He should be able to easily jump across such a distance...!

"You lost because you wouldn't move from there. I'm done with my investigation, so I'm out of here."
Lancer crouches low and braces his lance against the ground.
Using his lance as support, Lancer vaults into the air.
There...
"What?"
He is struck by the simplest of attacks.

A fake heart is taken out of Lancer's chest.
Assassin has directly gouged out Lancer's heart from the distant shore, an impossible range.

It is the purest magic, the simplest curse.
It is the "cursed hand", a magic of the Middle East, specialized in cursing people.
It is Assassin's Noble Phantasm, Zabaniya.
It surely destroys Lancer's heart, and the powerless body of the spearman falls into the black water.

The surface boils.
It is hectic, ferocious, and vulgar.
You would not see such a gruesome meal even if meat were thrown into a cage of starving beasts.
Numerous black limbs eliminate the human-shaped heroic spirit.
Watching it in delight as he stands on the black water...
The faceless Servant swallows the heart of his prey with satisfaction.
We'll patrol Shinto.
We can't let our guards down, even if Caster's been defeated.
We have to find Lancer's Master and determine whether he's good or evil.

"We'll go to Shinto. Please follow me like that."
"Understood. So the plan is the same as yesterday?"
"Yeah. We'll pretend we're normal citizens until we sense the enemy."

I turn off the light in the living room.
We exit the house silently so that we won't wake Sakura.

We patrolled the town for an hour, but we didn't find anything.

According to Saber, Caster's magical energy, which once permeated Shinto, is now fading away. However, I cannot sense the change.
I don't feel any magical energy that stands out, so there must be no Masters in Shinto...

"What is wrong, Shirou? You look gloomy."
"Huh...? Oh, it's nothing. I'm just wondering if the station was always this desolate. This place feels like a..."

I stop myself before I finish with the term "ghost town".
...I bet it just happened to be like this tonight.
There's nothing wrong. It's just that there isn't anybody walking about tonight.

"Let's go home, Saber. I don't think we'll find anything even if we walk around aimlessly."
"...You are right. You do not seem to be feeling well, so we should go home for tonight."

We leave Shinto.
Our footsteps echo through the empty station.
We'll patrol Miyama City.
It's that I want to secure my grounds, but also, Miyama City isn't as populated as Shinto.
I fear that Servants have more freedom to kill innocent people without having anyone notice.

"We'll look around the residential zone for tonight. ...I know this area is Tohsaka's territory and other Masters won't be able to do anything so easily, but we'll make sure of it."
"Understood. I have already verified that there are no enemies around here, but let us patrol the hill on the opposite side."

She must mean the Western-styled neighborhood.
It seems Saber patrolled the town while I was at school yesterday.

"Shirou? Are we not going?"
"O-Oh, we're going. Then please follow me, Saber."

I turn off the light in the living room.
We exit the house silently so that we won't wake Sakura.

...We don't see anything wrong with Miyama City.
We went by the Matou household, but it was silent, and we didn't feel any magical energy, nor the presence of a Servant.

"...I do not see anything abnormal. It has been a day since Caster was eliminated. I believe other Masters are keeping watch."
"...Yeah. I hope so."

  According to Saber, Caster's energy, which once covered Shinto, is now fading away.
There aren't any Masters that will suck up magical energy from innocent people now.

Butwhat is this vague uneasiness?

The town is quiet.
This place is deserted.
It was quiet yesterday as well, but it feels positively desolate tonight, almost as though we're trapped inside a still image.

"Let us go home, Shirou. There is nothing wrong with this area.
 You do not seem to be feeling well, so we should go home and rest for tonight."
"Y-Yeah, you're right. It's almost midnight, so we should go home."
Urged by Saber, we go up the hill.

...The town is quiet.
The moon hangs in the black sky as if frozen.
...I return to my room.
It's two o'clock. It's late, but there's still time to do my daily training.

"! ...Damn, I thought I got better."
I must have let my guard down, because the moment I return to my room, I'm overcome by drowsiness.
...Saber told me I should rest, so maybe I should skip my training and sleep for tonight.

"...Yeah. I should get a good night's sleep instead of pushing myself."
...I lay out the futon with languid motions, then fall onto it.
The futon smells like the sun.
It's because Sakura aired it out today.

"...I... wonder if Sakura's feeling better..."
I mutter absent-mindedly.
...It feels so good.
I feel myself relax as soon as I settle into the futon.  I must've been more tired than I thought.

"...Hm... I have to thank her tomorrow..."
I drop my eyelids.
In this atmosphere, gentle as a sunny day, I soon fall into a deep sleep.
It's been a few hours since we started training.
Saber's training is not what one can call kendo.
Saber doesn't practice kendo to begin with, and it seems she has no intention to teach me swordsmanship.

All she wants me to learn is the actual feeling of a battle.
She's helping me gain experience in battle so that I can stay composed when I fight other Masters, when our lives will be at stake.

I'm grateful for that.
There's no way she can teach me swordsmanship in a day or two.
All I can rely on is my body, which I have trained until now.
Then the best training I can get is practical experience, so that I'll be able react normally in critical situations

"There!"
"Ow...!"
Then.
As soon as my focus wavers, Saber's shinai strikes my chest.

"Shirou. Do not let your guard down just because you are out of range. Range does not matter with the skills you have.
 The only place you can afford to let your guard down is in this house."

"Sorry, I did let my guard down."
I climb to my feet, clutching my chest and coughing weakly.

"...Geez. You are surprisingly sharp at times, but defenseless at others. If you are able to control this"
Saber looks outside.

"What's wrong, Saber?"
"Well, Sakura is waving her hand at us from the porch. ...It seems she is calling for you, Shirou."
"M-Me...?"

...I wonder what it could be.
Sakura couldn't bear to watch me get beaten up, so she begged us to stop training.
She went back to the living room when I refused, but...

"...I'm going to the living room for a bit. Is that all right?"
"Yes. We have been training for two hours, so a rest is appropriate."
"Thanks. Then I'll get some tea while I'm at it."

"Oh, Senpai."
Sakura is standing by the phone when I arrive.

"...Um, you have a phone call. She's been waiting for you."
Sakura gets away from the phone.
"A phone call...? At this time?"
Could it be Fuji-Nee...? Maybe she wants me to bring something she forgot, or maybe she wants to tell me a joke she just came up with.

"All right. Hello.
 This is Emiya"

"It's not 'this is Emiya'!!
 Why are you absent without my permission!!!!!?"

The receiver roars.
What kind of magic is she using to make her voice rattle the walls through this small speaker?

"Man"
I shake my head to clear the ringing in my ears.
"Are you listening to me!? Are you okay!?"
The stranger, Tohsaka Rin, forges ahead without waiting for a response.

"...I'm listening. I'm listening, so lower your voice. My eardrums will burst if you keep talking like that."
"......Humph. Like always, you're missing the point. Well, it seems like nothing happened with the way you are.
 Geez, guess I was worried about nothing."

"......"
Her words are harsh and cold.
You're the one who never changes, Tohsaka.

"Well, what do you want?
 Did something happen to make you come calling me like that?"
"Yes, something did happen!  You went to the Ryudou Temple yesterday, even after I warned you not to."

"Ugh. How do you know that?"
"I had a lookout there. ...Well, I guess nothing happened, seeing that you're okay. I imagined something slightly bad since you weren't at school today."

"Oh, so you thought I was killed?"
"Yeah. I thought you were torn apart and buried on that mountain."
"......"
Well...
I don't think that's a "slightly bad imagination".

"Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm doing great... Well, I'm dying, but I'm hanging in there.
 So, what's your business?"
"Huh...? Well..."

"You can stop sounding me out.
 Oh, you want to ask about the Master at the Ryudou Temple, right? We beat himwell, actually, he was already gone.
 He was betrayed by his Servant, Caster.
 And"

...Wait, I can't talk any more about this subject.
Even though I'm whispering, Sakura is behind me.
I can't let her hear anything about people dying.

"Anyway, there's no Servant or Master at the Ryudou Temple anymore. That's what you wanted to know, right?"
"...Y-Yeah, you're pretty thoughtful."
"Then I'm hanging up. I'm training right now, so my whole body's in pain."
I end the conversation.

"H-Hold on!"
"...? What, you don't have any more business, right?"
"I-I do...! Come to school tomorrow. I have something important to talk to you about."
Smack!
She slams the receiver down. Well, that's just like her.

"...Man, how selfish of her. She got mad at me for going to school yesterday, and now she wants me to go tomorrow."
I put the receiver down.
I turn to go prepare the tea I promised.

...Then.
I see Sakura, hanging her head for some reason.

"Sakura? Are you feeling all right?"
"Yes, but... I'm just wondering what happened to make you seem so happy."

"What?"
I seem happy?
Did I look happy when I was on the phone with Tohsaka?

"No way. I'm actually mad."
"...That's... why. You don't even notice it yourself."
Sakura looks away awkwardly.

"...Hm?"
I wonder about her behavior as I make tea for the three of us.

By the time we finish our training, the sky is tinted red.

"I'm done preparing the yellowtail. We also need pumpkin and tomatoes, right?"
"Oh, I've taken care of that. I'm putting the sauce on before I cook it... Oh, can you take out the bowls since I'll be making savory egg custard? Fuji-Nee went out and bought some crabs yesterday."

"Oh, the crab-flavored fish paste? I like that because they're tasty and nice-looking."
Sakura takes out the bowls and places them on the kitchen counter.
I'm making dinner to thank her for everything she did today.

I want Sakura to relax in the living room with Saber, but she stubbornly insists on helping me.

"...?"
Then...
We're interrupted by the doorbell.
Sakura's already here, so that means there's a visitor at my place.

"Oh, I'll go get it. If it's a newspaper salesman, I'll send him away."
"Sakura?"
Sakura goes to the front door before I can stop her.


...I have a bad feeling about this.
I put the radish down and go to the front door.

The doorbell hasn't stopped ringing.
Whoever it is, they must be hysterical.
Sakura unlocks the door to greet the visitor.

At that instant...
"Why aren't you coming home!?"
I hear a heavy sound and some angry words.

It happened in an instant.
The doorbell doesn't stop.
"Who is it?"
Sakura opens the door while calling out to the visitor.
"!"
Shinji throws the door open and storms in.

"Nii-san...!?"
"Heywhy aren't you coming home!?"
As soon as Shinji sees Sakura, he raises his arm, and...

He smacks her, but what slams into her cheek isn't the palm of his hand, but a fist.

"Wha"
I run.
Sakura hits the wall and crumples to the floor.
Shinji runs to Sakura, with his arm ready to punch her again

"What are you doing, Shinji...!?"
"Humph. I'll do whatever I want. If she spends the night at someone's house without my permission, it's only natural that she gets punished."
"It's... natural...?"

"Are you deaf? I'm saying a piece of shit who won't do as she's told deserves to get hit.
 You're the one who's seducing her in the first place. How are you any different from me? We're both using Sakura as we please."


I'm speechless.
I seriously...

"Oh, what's that? You got to do her once last night, and now you don't want to let her go because you want more? I can't blame you, Sakura is"


...Want to kill Shinji.

"Huh? What's with that face? Are you stupid?"
"Shinji."
"Ooh, I like that tone. All right, let's pick up where we left off, Emiya."

I clench my fist.
I can't stop myself.
I
I can't restrain myself, and I shouldn't even try to.
I clench my fist tighter.
Shinji just stands there, smiling as he awaits my attack, and
I suppress my anger with all my might.
What good will it do?
My fight with Shinji has already ended.
It's meaningless to attack Shinji now, and I can't fight Shinji in front of Sakura
"Please stop, Nii-san...!
 Please, don't do it here!"
I get myself together with her voice.

"Sakura."
"What a surprise. Isn't this the first time you've talked to me like that?"
Shinji's voice sounds more delighted than I've ever heard from him.
Sakura is hanging her head, her body trembling.

"So? Say it again. I couldn't hear you really well."
"......Yes. I'll do anything you say, so please don't do it in front of Senpai. I'll go home if you tell me to."

"Ohh. So you're going to do anything I say?"
"........."
Sakura nods.

"I see. If you're so determined, then I won't take you home. A big brother has to respect his sister's wishes, after all. Isn't that right, Emiya?"
"Shinji."

"Haha. Don't make such a scary face. That was just a joke. People will form a bad opinion of you if you won't let go of your grudges."
Shinji walks back to the front door.

"Bye. Take care of Sakura, Emiya.
 But don't forget what you just said, Sakura."
Shinji waves goodbye and leaves.
He leaves alone, without taking Sakura with him.

We resume cooking.
"........."
Unsure of what to say, I cut up the tomatoes and pumpkins in silence.
The unbroken sound of chopping gives the kitchen an awkward atmosphere.

"The rice is done, Senpai. Fujimura-Sensei isn't here yet, but we can start dinner without her, right?"
"Ohyeah. It's a bit early, but let's do that."
"Okay. I'll prepare right away."

Sakura moves briskly, as if nothing happened.

...She's obviously pushing herself.
Sakura pretends to be okay so that I won't be worried.

"......"
I should act that way too if that's how Sakura's going to act.
Sakura's the one who got hurt.
If she's going to smile, I have to smile as... well...?

"Sakura?"
The sound of a bowl breaking causes me to turn around.

Pieces of the shattered bowl are by Sakura's feet.


".....!"
Sakura suddenly collapses.
She sinks to a sitting position, then keels over backward

"Sakura!"
I quickly raise her off the floor.
"Ow...!?"
Sakura's body is burning hot, even through her uniform.

"Sakura... Hey, Sakura...!"
"EhSen... pai...? What's... going on...?"

There's no strength in her voice.
But she tries her best to say something.

"It's not 'what's going on'...!? You're still sick...!"
"Oh... no... I'm fine."
"You idiot...! You wouldn't collapse like that if you're fine!"

Damn, I'm an idiot.
I knew Sakura had a cold, but I overworked her without thinking.
And to finish it off, there's what happened just now. After everything she's been through physically and mentally, it's natural that she'd collapse!

"I'm sorry for breaking the bowl, Senpai.
 I'll clean it up right awakya!?"
I hold up Sakura in my arms.

"S-Senpai!?"
"Dinner can come later. I'm going to take you to bed and have you rest. Complain to me after you get better."

I head to the outbuilding with Sakura in my arms.
She's trying to say something, but I ignore her.
I'm so mad that I can't talk.


Sakura must have given up, as she is silent by the time we get to the guest room.
She hangs her head, but follows my directions.
Although her face is flushed with fever, it doesn't seem all that bad.

I leave her room.
I'm changing the menu for tonight.
I have to hurry and go make some rice porridge so that I can return her favor.

It's almost ten o'clock.
We ate dinner, and it's time to start patrolling the area.

"......"
Sakura is sleeping in the guest room.
I ate dinner with Saber.
Fuji-Nee never showed up, so she must be busy tonight.

"Shirou. It is almost time."
"......"
Saber urges me.
For tonight
I can't leave Sakura alone tonight.
It's not like I can do anything, but I want to stay here so that I can go help her if she needs help.

"I'm sorry, Saber. We're not patrolling tonight. I'm worried about Sakura."
"Understood. I will follow your order."
"What?"

I-I'm surprised.
I thought Saber would object, but she readily accepted my proposal.

"Please do not misunderstand. Sakura is not the only one who is sick. You are exhausted as well, so please rest for tonight.
 The extra time will help you replenish your magical energy. You are not to push yourself."
"Thanks, Saber."

"Y-You do not need to thank me. I am your Servant. It is natural for me to place my master's welfare first."
Saber reaches out for her tea.

"So, Shirou. Have you a reward for your considerate servant?"
Saber makes a cute request with eyes full of expectation.

"OhI see. Hold on, Saber."
I realize she wants something to eat with the tea, so I grab the cookies that Fuji-Nee bought for her.


I shut off my Magic Circuit.
I sigh with relief after the stick of fire exits my spine.

I've skipped my daily routine for the past few days, but it went pretty smoothly tonight.
Even though it used to be a challenge, activating my Magic Circuit is easy now.  Maybe it's because of my contract with Saber.

"But it's no good if it takes me a minute to do it."
The only weapon I can use has to be prepared beforehand using my "strengthening" magic.
If I'm attacked by surprise, I'll have no way of fighting back.
If I can shorten the time to around thirty seconds, maybe I'll be able to do something

"Maybe I'll ask Tohsaka about it. She might know how to quickly make a Magic Circuit."
Well, I can't ask her just like that.  Who knows what she'll demand in return?

"Hm...?"
I hear footsteps.
The person is walking slowly.
...It's midnight.
The person coming here under the moonlight is...
"Senpai...? Are you still awake?"
Sakura, who looks much better than earlier tonight.


My mind blanks out.
...Sakura's wearing something I don't recognize.
It takes me completely by surprise.
It must be the change of clothes Fuji-Nee prepared for her, but seeing her in something other than her uniform makes my head spin.

"...Um, Senpai?"
"OhYeah, I'm awake. Are you okay, Sakura? It's cold outside."
"Yes, my fever's almost gone. I came outside to refresh myself and heard a sound, so I thought it might be you."

"I see. Then all that's left is to warm yourself up and go back to sleep. That's good."
I turn on the stove I just fixed.

Good, it works.
This should warm up this place.

"Here. It's still pretty chilly in here, but it's better than outside.
 ...Um, if you're not sleepy anymore, I can keep you company."

"Okay. Then please excuse me, Senpai."

Sakura comes in, her steps steady and sure.
...Good, it looks like she's really better.  That's a relief.

"It's warm. So this was fixable."
"Somehow. I almost didn't bother trying since it was so old."

"You're right. You got mad and said you'd rather fix the VCR Fujimura-Sensei cut in half.
 But you couldn't throw it away, right?"

"...Well, I guess this stove wasn't the only obstinate one."
 It was broken, but it looked fixable, so I just couldn't leave it alone.

"You don't listen to others once you set your mind on something, Senpai. You seem sensible, but you're actually very stubborn. Did you know that?"
"...Hm. Am I stubborn?"

"You are. And you're really forceful.
 You didn't listen to me earlier, either."

...?
Even though Sakura's criticizing me, she's in a good mood.
...Well, I'm too happy to see her doing well to care about that.

"...I'm sorry. I was too angry to think straight."
"You're right. You were just as mad at me as at yourself. ...Yes. I'm causing you lots of trouble. But I really was sorry because I thought I did something awful."

"......"
Sakura is perfectly composed.
It's probably partly because she just got over a cold, but she's not merely putting on a strong face. This seems like the "real" Sakura to me.

"I remember when I was a child.
 I always stayed in the house and couldn't say what I wanted. I thought everything would work out if I didn't say anything."

"...But it didn't do any good. I didn't want to worry anyone, but never speaking worried Nii-san and my dad even more."

"...I see. But it's true that you cared for your father and Shinji, so I bet they knew how you felt. There are things that can be communicated without words."

"Yes. I hope that's true.
 ...So what about you, Senpai? I don't hear much about when you were a child."

"Uh, me...? Hmm, I don't think I was too different. I was always running throughout the town during the daytime, making meals for my father, and messing around with stuff here at night."
I get embarrassed, so I scratch my cheek.
...Does it mean I'm a failure as a man if I haven't changed from when I was a kid?

"Wow. You were running throughout the town?"
"Yeah... I thought I was patrolling the town. I admired helping the weak and crushing the strong."

My battlefield was mainly in the park.
I think it was an everyday thing to fight with children my age against people older than me.
...Hmm, now that I think about it, a smart and devil-like person was in my age group too...

"I see, so you were protecting the town from bullies? You were like that even when you were little?"
"Sakura. Smiling like that reminds me of all the stupid things I did, so please stop. It's pretty embarrassing."

"It's not embarrassing at all. I would've been your sidekick if I met you as a child.
 A shy person like me needs someone to drag her outside."

"...A sidekick?"
...Oh. Well, I might have trained Sakura every day if she'd been with me as a child.
I would've run by the river or sat in the dojo with her.

That's pretty much what a sidekick would do.
Under my watchful eye, Sakura would become strong, and then she would turn into a devil like...

Her, or her.

"Ugh."
A chill runs down my spine.
Good. I'm really glad that Sakura is modest.

"Um, Senpai?"
"Huh? Oh, I was out of it. I was just talking to myself, so please don't worry about it."

"...Okay. That's fine, but, um... Can I ask you an awkward question?"
"...? Okay, what?"

"...I heard this from Fujimura-Sensei. Is it true that you were adopted into the Emiya family?"
"Huh? Didn't I tell you? I'm adopted, just like Fuji-Nee told you."

"U-Um, Senpai? That means..."
"Well, it's true, and it's nothing I should hide. Why are you asking such a thing?"

"Eh... um, don't you care about it? You were adopted into a stranger's family, so, um... weren't there a lot of things you didn't like?"

"Oh, did Fuji-Nee give you the wrong idea?
 ...Well, it might've looked that way when I first came here, but it wasn't hard on me, and there was nothing I didn't like."

"Then was it fun for you, Senpai?"

Hm.
This is the first time I've been asked this question.
After that fire...
...My first year here was spent healing my wounds.

...And after that...
My time until now has been spent in constant motion.
I studied magic to be more like Kiritsugu, and I ran around the town, looking for the reason why only I survived that night.

I never had time to wonder if I was enjoying myself.

"Hmm, I don't know. I don't know if it was fun for me or not. I just wanted to be like my father."

"You mean to be a superhero, like Fujimura-Sensei said?"
Sakura asks timidly.
To that...
"Yeah. Is that weird?"
I answer while scratching my cheek.

"No, I don't think so.  It's amazing that you're so sure of yourself."

Her words are calm.
I usually get embarrassed from such words, but her words hit me so much that I'm tempted to thank her.

"Here's another question. Would you be able to forgive me if I become a bad person?"

"What...?"
My head blanks out from the sudden question.
...But to answer seriously...
"No. I'd get mad if you do something bad. I'd get more mad than anybody else."
I'd probably be first in line to scold her.

"I'm glad.  I'd want you to do that."
Sakura nods in relief.

"...?"
Seeing her smile makes me think that something like this happened before.

"I'm going back to my room. Good night, Senpai."
Sakura leaves.
As I see her off, I try to remember where I've seen that smile before, but my memory fails me.

I return to my room.
I lie on my futon, trying not to wake Saber, and right when I'm about to close my eyes...

"I remember now."
In a sudden flash of insight, it comes back to me.
Yes, it was

It was in the shed, just like tonight.
It was two years ago... no, one and a half years to be exact.

It happened during the summer two years ago.
I continued to refuse every time Sakura offered to come help me at my house.
But Sakura did not give up and kept visiting my house with obstinacy you would never expect from her.

I gave upwell, Sakura's effort beat me to be exact, but I called Sakura to the shed and admitted my defeat.
"You beat me. I lost, so I'll give you this."

It was an old key.
I gave Sakura the key to my house that I kept in the shed which Kiritsugu used to use.

Surprised, Sakura tried to refuse.
She said something ridiculous about how a stranger couldn't possibly accept such a gift.

"Hey now. You're coming to help me every day, so you're no stranger.
 Please feel free to use this. ...Um, it would help me out if you did."

I forced the key into her hands.
And that's when I saw it.
"...Okay. Thank you, Senpai. This is the second gift I've received from someone dear to me."
Sakura smiled happily as she nodded.

"OhI see."
That's what's been bugging me.
Sakura works hard and always has a warm smile.
But that was the last time her smile looked satisfied

"So. I think people get mad when they're told the truth."

Tohsaka ponders as she eats my lunch.
She came to the rooftop empty-handed.
Which, of course, meant that she didn't have her lunch.
Then it was only natural for her to target mine.

"Just eat. ...Man, why do you have chopsticks when you don't have your own lunch? Do you always carry them around?"

"...? I just brought these with me when I left my classroom. You had your lunch last time, so I thought I'd have you share some of yours. I came prepared just in case you had boxed lunch."

"...Hey now. I think you're putting thought into the wrong areas."
Bring some food before you bring chopsticks.

"Don't worry about minor details. You brought two people's worth of food, so it turned out fine."

"......"
No, this isn't two people's worth of food.
It's just that Sakura made too much.

"...Oh well. It's true that I won't be able to finish it by myself. Oh, don't just eat the vegetables. Eat some meat as well. I'll get an upset stomach if I just eat meat."

"What? I don't want it because that's too sweet.
 Don't tell a girl to eat meat. I'm keeping track of how much I've eaten, so if I'm not eating it, that's a sign that I've had my share."

"Liar. I bet you're the type that doesn't hold back when you go eat yakiniku. I'm suuuuuure of it. You'll be scarfing down beef ribs while I'll be munching on my salted fish.
 You won't show any consideration for my money.  In fact, you'll try to bankrupt me. And after you're satisfied, you're going to tell me, 'Heh, I went easy this time.'"
I try to get back at her for what she said earlier.

"...Well said, Emiya-kun. I find it scary that I can't deny that."

...No.
You're the scary one, Tohsaka.

"But this lunch sure is strange. There's a lot of food here, but the wrapping and all is really feminine. Do you like to cook, Emiya-kun?"
What a coincidence.
I think I heard the same exact thing this morning.

"...Well, it's not like I hate cooking, but Sakura made today's lunch.
 Oh, Sakura is"
"...Tohsaka? What's wrong? Did you bite on a lump of sugar?"
"...Oh geez... I did it..."
Tohsaka sighs and puts away her chopsticks.

"Thanks. You can eat the rest by yourself."
Tohsaka gets away awkwardly.

"...?"
Well, it's fine if she's full already.
I was nervous eating lunch next to Tohsaka.  Now I can enjoy a little peace of mind.

I head back to my classroom.
It's a few minutes before fifth period starts, and the hallway is filled with students going back to their classrooms.

In contrast, the stairs are quiet and empty.
Not many students go to a different floor to eat.
There...
I bump into Sakura.

She looks away awkwardly as soon as she sees us.
"...?"
What could be wrong with her?
She was so energetic this morning, but she looks depressed now.

"Sakura"
I call out to her.
But before I can say anything else...

"I'm sorry, Sakura. It was bad timing on my part."
...Tohsaka steps forward.

"Eh... No, you didn't do anything wrong. Even if Senpai and Tohsaka-Senpai are together, it has nothing to do with"

"You're misunderstanding. I went and invited him because I had to talk to him about something. And he didn't skip out on you, either. He just didn't realize it."
"...Hmmm? What do you mean? It's not like I made a promise with Sakura"

"You idiot. She made lunch for you, so that means she wanted to eat with you. It's natural for Sakura to be mad."
"What?"
H-Hold on.
We never made any promise to eat together

"...U-Um, Senpai? How about eating at the archery range in that case?
 The range is open during lunchtime, I can make you some tea, and it's quiet there"

And...
...When I look, I see that Sakura's lunch is untouched.


...That's right.
What was I thinking!? Tohsaka's absolutely right to call me an idiot...!

"I-I'm sorry, Sakura! I'm so stupid...!"
"N-No, it's fine! See, it's not like we made a promise, and I just thought it might be good if we could eat together"

"It's not good! Let's go, Sakura! We'll still make it!
 We can eat quickly in the archery range and"
I grab Sakura's hand and start running.

But.
"There's no way you'll make it. What can you do in three minutes?"

"!"
Tohsaka's calm analysis stops me.
...I panicked because I felt guilty for breaking the promise, but Tohsaka is one-hundred-percent right.

"It's fine, Senpai. We have to go back to our classrooms, just like Tohsaka-Senpai says."
"Ugh... But Sakura..."

"Please don't worry too much about it. That was enough for me. Thank you."

I don't know what to say when she makes a face like that.

"Then I'll be going. You two will be late if you don't hurry."
Sakura goes up the stairs with her lunch in her hand.

"I'd better get going too.
 Go to the Chinese restaurant in the shopping district after school. Wait there, okay?"

Then.
Tohsaka leaves a strange message before she leaves for her classroom.

Fifth period ends and the room empties out quickly.
It's not even two o'clock yet.

"...Phew. I don't feel like it, but Tohsaka told me to."
There's nothing I can do here, so I guess I'll go to the shopping district.
We walk up the hill.
There are more students around us than usual.  It must be because there's no morning practice today.

"We still have time. It's been a while since we had a morning where we could take it easy."
Sakura is walking happily besides me.
I don't know why, but she's in a good mood.

"This is normal for me, but... I guess it has been a while since I went to school with you."
"Yes. The archery club practices every morning."

"But participation isn't required, right? Most people only go once every two days, so you should skip once in a while."
"What? U-Um, would you walk to school with me if I skipped practice?"

"...? Of course. We're going to the same place, so we'll be walking together either way."
"Oh, then
 No, I can't do that. I'm not that good, so I can't afford to skip a day of practice."
Sakura sticks her tongue out at herself.

"...? Are you sure about that? Not to speak ill of anyone, but you're the best in your grade. You have great form, so I don't think there'll be any trouble, even if you skip a day or two."

"No, I'm still inexperienced. My thoughts trail off if I let my guard down, and I often don't see the target.
 I'm lazy at heart, so I tend to slack off unless I push myself to train a little every day."
...Hm.
If that's how she feels, who am I to disagree?

I part with Sakura.
My class is on the third floor, and hers is on the fourth.

"I'll see you later, Senpai."
"Yeah. Don't fall asleep during class. People tend to get sleepy when they're full."

"Ahaha, you don't need to worry. I'm not full anymore."
Sakura goes up the stairs.
I wave goodbye to her and head to my classroom.

It's lunchtime.
Shinji is absent, and so is Issei.
...It seems Issei is being treated at the hospital after the incident at the Ryudou Temple.
Now that I look around, I see that there are more people absent.


But the number of absentees shouldn't get any higher, at least.
The Servant that was sucking the life force out of people in this town has been eliminated.
There should be no more unexplained comas.

"Yeah. The people Caster harmed will get well and come back soon."

I pull myself together.
There are four Masters remaining.
Two, if you don't count Tohsaka and Ilya. I can't let my guard down until I know what kind of people they are.

Oh.
We speak out in unison.
I bump into Tohsaka the instant I go out into the hallway.

"Hey, what do you mean, 'oh'? Isn't that a rude thing to say? Or do you have a guilty conscience?"

"Hey, the same goes for you, you were surprised too.
 ...And what was up with the phone call last night? You were being selfish, telling me not to come and to come."

"Well... Yesterday was an exception. You skipped school the day after the Master at Ryudou Temple disappeared.  Of course I thought something happened to you.
 ...Um, I told you about the Ryudou Temple, so it'd trouble me if something happened to you."


...I'm surprised.
Did Tohsaka feel responsible because she told me about it?

"I see. Thanks, Tohsaka. You were worried about me, right?"
"T-That's not true! I just want to know the details of what happened, since I gave you the information!"

"Huh? But I told you over the phone yesterday, right? Both Caster and her Master are defeated. There's nothing at the Ryudou Temple anymore."
Huh?
Tohsaka looks serious all of a sudden.

"What's wrong, Tohsaka? Did I say something weird?"
"Yes, you did. It's not that I don't trust you, but let me confirm. You're absolutely certain that you defeated Caster?"

"...Humph. Even I could tell that.
 Saber completely eliminated Caster. ...Caster's Master is"
...He was already dead when we got there.

"...All right. There's something I want to talk about regarding that. Can you come to the rooftop?"
There's only one Chinese restaurant in the shopping district.
Koushuuensaikan: Taizan.
It's an ominous dungeon in the shopping district, with no windows to show you what's inside.  Most first-time customers run away after seeing the place.
The manager, a favorite of the neighborhood association, is a strange little Chinese man nicknamed "small manager."  Batsu-san has a tendency to fill every dish with red pepper.

In other words, the food's hot.
Really hot.
Imagine being stabbed in the tongue and then having salt rubbed into it, and you'll be on the right track.

This restaurant's infernal seasonings have given me a general distaste for Chinese food.
It doesn't help that the manager keeps adding "aru" at the end of every sentence.

"......"
And now I'm entering this terrible dungeon willingly.
The manager will bring a menu as soon as he sees me.
That'll be the end of it.
At the very least, I'll have to order something that uses sweet vinegar.

It'll turn out horrible if I order something like twice cooked pork, and mapo tofu is out of the question. That stuff is dangerous. It'll melt my tongue. I hear the judge of hell pulls out your tongue, so such awful food could easily come from there. The manager traveled abroad to train his cooking arts, so maybe he trained with the devils.

"Phew."
It's almost two-thirty.
I promised to be here right after school, so I can't hesitate any longer.

"All right, I'm going!"
I don't know why I have to get pumped up to go into a restaurant, but here it's necessary.
I'm not sure what Tohsaka was thinking when she said we should meet here, but I'm sure she's regretting it now.

Wait.
"Hm? You're finally here, Emiya? I came early, so I have already started eating."
The priest is eating mapo tofu.


I'm speechless.
Why is Kotomine here?
Why is he eating mapo tofu that looks like a boiling pot?
And why is he eating it so fast?
He's sweating, but he never stops for a drink, spiritedly moving his hands as if they will never move again if he stops.

Actually... Is he just being stubborn? He's eating it way too fast.
Or is it that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

Then this is bad. This restaurant and Kotomine are both bad.
That food has dangerous amounts of spice. It can't be explained any other way.

"What's wrong? Don't just keep standing and sit down."
The priest talks as he keeps eating.

"......"
I take caution as I sit across from him... Well, I'm not too sure what I'm on guard against.


I watch his movements.
...Amazing. He only has about two more mouthfuls left.
I watch in amazement when Kotomine suddenly stops eating.



Our eyes meet.
Kotomine watches me with his usual oppressive eyes and...
"Do you want some?"
"I don't want any!"
I reply with all my might.

The priest frowns a bit before he finishes the mapo tofu.
...Huh?
Did my reply disappoint him?

...The only one waiting for me is Kotomine.
It seems he asked Tohsaka to invite me here.

"...So, what do you want? Isn't it unusual for you to come talk to someone?"
"Well, I heard that you have already defeated two Servants. I came to commend you on your achievements."
...He's lying.
Even if it is true, he should have picked a better restaurant.

"I see. I'm sorry, but I think your words are good enough.
 I'm not fighting for your sake. There's no reason for you to praise me."
"Hm. I guess there was no need for banal flattery.
 Then let me cut to the chase. You heard from Rin that Caster is still alive, correct?"

"...Yeah. Caster still exists, and she's collecting magical energy from the people in town, right?"

"Yes. I do not know if it is related, but there was another Servant at the Ryudou Temple on the night you defeated Caster.
 I believe it to be Assassin, judging by the appearance and combat style, but I am not certain."

"Assassin... Then Assassin was also at the Ryudou Temple? But Saber said..."

"She did not sense him, right? Assassin is not a strong heroic spirit, but their class has the special ability to conceal its presence. Covert action is their area of expertise. Even Saber should not be able to sense Assassin if he hides his presence."

"......"
Then that means Assassin was at the Ryudou Temple on the night we defeated Caster.
Was he hiding near us, trying to find an opening to attack?

"...I understand. But why are you telling me all this? I thought the supervisor doesn't help one particular Master."

"I am merely sharing information with you. I have told you all I know. In exchange, tell me what you have experienced over the last few days. ...There is something strange about this Holy Grail War.
 Something is different from the last war."


"If you do not wish to tell me, I will not force you. Just take my words as a warning."

"...No, I'll pay your price. After all, you came out and gave me information that I needed."

"Hah. You have a strong sense of duty as always, Emiya Shirou."
The priest smiles in satisfaction.
...Heh. It seems he knows every move I'm going to make.
But I'm not going to fall for his tricks that easily.

"I'll talk. But first, I have a question.
 How do you know such a thing?
 You wouldn't know that Assassin was at the Ryudou Temple unless you had a Servant."

No, he shouldn't know even if he does have a Servant.
Neither Saber nor Archer, Tohsaka's Servant, could tell.

"It is simple. My Lancer was defeated by Assassin at the temple. As his Master, I needed only retrieve his last sight."
Then.
The priest simply states something absurd.

"What?"
"I said that I am also a Master. You said it too. That I would not know unless I had a Servant.
 Well, you are certainly correct."

"Huhwhat!?"
"But that ended last night. Lancer has been eliminated, which means that I am not a Master. I am no longer your enemy.
 Well, is that all you want to ask me? Then it is your turn to talk. Tell me who you met and what you saw over the past couple of days."

The atmosphere becomes heavy in an instant.
He doesn't allow me any questions.
He wants answers.

"......"
...I have a lot of things I want to ask him, but I have to answer him first.
In as much detail as possible, I recount what happened to me after making my contract with Saber four days ago.

...The story lasts for about thirty minutes.
I haven't done much as a Master.
The information I provided is mostly useless.
But the priest takes great interest in Matou Zouken.

"Matou ZoukenI thought he had withered away, but he is still active? I guess it is true that he is a blood-sucking monster."

"Huh...? That old man is a blood-sucking monster...?"
"Yes. The magic of the Matou family is absorption. I hear that Matou Zouken, a magus from six generations back, was a prominent bug user."

...?
Using bugs... That doesn't mean his familiar is a bug, right?
Or... another way to use bugs is...

"Hold on. By bug user... do you mean like guys who use bugs as a medium for poison? Like, putting in hundreds of poisonous bugs in a pot, and using the last surviving one as a curse...?"

"No, that is wrong. From the start, cursing is outside of the Makiri's area of expertise.
 The results of their magic always return to their bodies.
 Cursing others would only result in mutual destruction."

"...Then he's using bugs as familiars?"

"Yes. Matou Zouken is merely a monster who feeds on the blood of others.
 I hear that he kept his youth by transfiguring his body and sucking blood, and that he has lived for a few hundred yearsbut...
 Based on what I heard from Rin's father, he is now on the verge of death, and can no longer walk in broad daylight."

"...He can't walk in broad daylight? ...Well, I did meet him both times at night"
He sucks on people's blood to prolong his life.
And he can't walk under the light of the sun. That's just like

"...Kotomine. Is Matou Zouken a vampire?"
"Heh. He is more like a parasitic insect. His nature and personality are like those of an insidious slug."
He insults Zouken.
It seems Kotomine really hates that old man.

"...You said he's been alive for a few hundred years. Then was he ever a Master?"

"No, Matou Zouken was never a Master. He is like a counselor for the Matou familybut he is a monster that lived for hundreds of years. He might have devised a plan to become a Master in a way we do not know of."

"...Then the one who made a contract with Caster after her Master was killed is..."

"Who knows? But he is not someone you can let your guard down against.
 If he has taken the stage, he must believe his victory is certain. That means that the Matou family's Master has the support of the worst devil in Makiri history."


Shinji said he hasn't given up.
And he has the backing of Matou Zouken.
He lost his Command Spell, but that old man might be able to give him a new Servant.

"You have been a great help. All these abnormalities make sense if the Makiri elder is in action. As the war's supervisor, I shall try to suppress the damage."
Kotomine nods to himself and relaxes.

"Supervisor, huh? You're not one to talk when you were secretly a Master until yesterday."

"Do not put it like that. I have no wish. I obtained Lancer because I wanted to give the Holy Grail to a more appropriate desirer.
 But that is over now. It is for the remaining Masters to decide.
 Well, personally, I would like either you or Rin to obtain the Holy Grail."


...I frown.
The priest is serious.
He just said that he doesn't need the Holy Grail.
In fact, he clearly told me that he wants either Rin or I to obtain it.

"...Why? You became a Master because you want the Holy Grail, right? Don't you have a wish you want granted?"

"Let's see. I do not have a wish, but I do have a goal. My goal is not a serious matter, and it is meaningless even if I achieve it myself."
"...?"
A goal that is meaningless if he achieves it himself...?

"What are you talking about? If you want to tell riddles, find somebody else."
"Consider it a friendly warning. We are the same, you and I. As we do not have clear wishes, we cannot seek salvation.
 I simply thought it would be easier for you if you quickly realized it."

"What?"
I feel like he has grabbed my heart in his hand.
The priest's words seep into my mind like a curse.

"Kotomine, you"
I constrict my wavering eyes and glare at him.
And then

"Here's your mapo tofu-aru!"

The second and third plates of mapo tofu are placed on the table.

"Hm."
Kotomine picks up his spoon.
I'm sure of it.
He ordered more servings beforehand.



...Our eyes meet.

Kotomine stares at me with oppressive eyes and...
"Do you want some?"
"No."
I answer him with a straight face.

I leave Ensaikan: Taizan.
...It's because Kotomine had no intention of talking anymore and started eating the mapo tofu.

As I leave the restaurant with a heartburn...
"Emiya. I have withdrawn from the war, but you and Rin are still Masters. Zouken is insidious, so be careful."
...The priest warns me as if it is someone else's problem.
"......"
It's almost four o'clock when I get out of the restaurant.
I have no business in the shopping district, so all that's left is to go home, but...

"Matou Zouken... Shinji and Sakura's grandfather, huh?"
I have a bad feeling about this.
I don't feel like going straight home, so I decide to take a detour.
Not enough love!

Hi, everyone, long time no see. How are you doing?
We're starting Tiger Dojo part III!

Well. This dead end is caused by lack of love!
You're forced to come to this dead end if this certain heroine's affection point is not past a certain value.

If you came to this dead end, it means you were not kind enough!

For example... this is only for argument's sake, but I don't know about leaving a sick girl alone to go walking about at night.

It might be good to restart from day 6 with that in mind.
Well, I'll be waiting for you in the next Tiger Dojo!
"......"
It's almost four o'clock when I get out of the restaurant.
I have no business in the shopping district, so all that's left is to go home.

  ", "

...But Kotomine's story is not something I can ignore.
Caster is still alive.
People are still falling into unexplained comas.
And

  "...! , !"

I'm still surprised by how calm I was when I found out Kotomine was a Master.
...Come to think of it, I never got along with him.
I must have known instinctively that we would be in opposition.

  "...Hey!"

...In any case, Kotomine lost his Servant.
There are three Masters remaining now.
Assassin's Master, who seems to be at the Ryudou Temple, and Archer's Master, Tohsaka.
And...

"HEEEEEEEEEEY!
 WHY ARE YOU SPACED OUT, SHIROU!!!!!?"

"Whoaaaa!?"
Berserker's Master, the girl in front of me right now!

"I-Ilya...!? W-Why did you suddenly jump on me!? You surprised me...!"
"Hey, it wasn't sudden! You're the one who didn't notice me when I was calling out to you!"

"What...?"
...Oh.
I thought I heard something, but could it be...?

"...Oh man. Have you been following me ever since the shopping district?"
"Yup. You were walking with a difficult expression.
 I called to you from behind so that I wouldn't bother you, but you just ignored me and kept on walking."

"Oh.  Well, I was thinking, so it's not like I was ignoring you..."
"And you didn't come to the park either. I was waiting all this time."

Oh... she's right.
We have a tacit understanding to meet there in the afternoon.
How could I have forgotten just because I was talking with Kotomine!?

"...Sorry, I forgot about it. I apologize, Ilya."
"Humph. I won't forgive you that easily. I'm really mad."

Ilya glares at me.
...Hmm, what should I do?
I can't blame her for getting mad, since I did forget our promise and make her wait.

I have to show her my sincerity, so
...Yeah.
I made her wait out here in the cold, so the least I can do is help her warm up again.

"I have a proposition, Ilya."
"What? I won't fall for cheap words."

"Right. That's why I'm going to apologize to you with my actions instead.
 Do you want to come to my house? I can treat you to some hot tea and snacks."

"Huhyou mean your house!?"
"Where else? There's no one homewell, Saber's home, but I won't let her attack you.
 I think drinking tea at home is good once in a while."

"Hm... It might be good, but... Can I really go to your house?"

"Of course. Besides, you showed me your castle the other day. It's my turn today."
"......Yeah. You did say that."
She sounds like she's trying to convince herself.

Then...

"Can I really go to your house? I came to kill you and Kiritsugu. Can such a person be allowed to enter your house?"
Ilya asks me emotionlessly.


I don't know how much meaning was put into those words.
The Einzbern girl who came to kill my father.
Her reason for pursuing Kiritsugu, her reason for wanting to kill me...
...These things I already know.

The man that betrayed Einzbern.
Kiritsugu abandoned everything and started living in this town.
I didn't know about all the sacrifices that made this life possible until I became a Master.

Ilya should not forgive Kiritsugu, and she really must want to kill me.
 I should invite her to my house despite that fact... no, more so because.

"Yeah. This Master business doesn't matter right now. I just want you to come over."
I answer her while looking straight into her eyes.


Ilya gasps, looks at me in astonishment, and...
"Okay! Thanks, Onii-chan!"
She hugs me with a big smile.

"All right. Stay here for a bit, Ilya. I have to go convince Saber."
I roll up my sleeves and glare at the entrance.

"Okay, go ahead, Shirou! Good luck!"
Ilya waves her hand and cheers me on.
All right!
I have to persuade Saber no matter what.

"I refuse."
Well, that didn't take very long.

"! Well, I understand how you feel. I know what you want to say.
 You want to tell me it's suicidal to invite Berserker's Master into our house, right? I understand, I really do. But set that aside for a moment"

"No, you do not understand! It is Ilyasviel we are talking about! A Master of her degree should easily be able to detect the weakness of this place!  It should be easy for her to destroy the boundary field! But you want to invite her in!? This is not just inviting in your enemy! You are about to drink poison out of your own will!"

"...B-But Ilya promised me she wouldn't do anything. And she doesn't have Berserker with her. She said we won't fight until nighttime. Ilya's just a girl, so don't get angry about such a trifling matter."

"Her gender does not matter! First of all, what were you doing with Ilyasviel behind my back!? You were almost killed by her. And you are showing concern for her? You are not good-natured, but just plain stupid!"

"Ugh... But Ilya's a good girl once you get to know her.
 She just doesn't know good from evil, so we merely have to teach her what's good and bad..."

"You are too optimistic! Are you simply taking her at her word, Shirou!? Her family exists only to obtain the Holy Grail. She will break her promises to you without a second thought!"

"...! T-That's not true! You're going too far, Saber. Ilya is Ilya. I don't know what these Einzbern people are like, but don't treat her like them!"

"...... That is certainly true. You are correct, Shirou."
"! Saber, then..."
"Well, it did not sound convincing when you suggested it in such a quiet voice."

"Uh, um..."
...Well, it's just that Saber was that mad.

"...I understand. If I continued to protest, you would likely use your Command Spell. I shall trust her, as you have trusted her."
"Saber."

"But I will not see her. I do not think I can stay composed in front of her, and I am sure she will be on guard if I am there."

"Y-Yeah, you're right. Then what are you going to do?"
"I shall stand by in the guest room. I shall quickly come to you in case of an emergency, so please do not worry."

"...Okay. I'm sorry, Saber, but this is..."
"I know. I am the one who told you about Kiritsugu and the Holy Grail War. I should have been prepared for this."
Saber lets out a sigh and goes to the guest room.


...I see.
Saber was my father's Servant in the last Holy Grail War.
Thenit's natural for her to know of the relationship between Kiritsugu and Ilya.

"Hello. So this is Shirou's house."
In contrast to her energetic voice, Ilya enters timidly.

"Let's have some tea first. I'll show you the living room, so follow me."
"Okay. Oh, this hallway has a wooden floor. Your house is Japanese, just like I heard."
Ilya looks around as she walks.

"......"
I guess this Japanese-style is unusual for her since she's living in a castle.

"Here you go. I thought about making English tea, but that's boring and I'm sure you have better ones at your place. I made some Japanese tea, so tell me if it's too bitter and I'll water it down for you."

I hand her the cup.
I used the best tea I had, so it should taste good. The only potential problem is that it might be too bitter.

"Oh, thanks, Shirou."
She sits Japanese-style and nervously takes a sip.

"Uh..."
Ilya freezes.
...I thought so. I was trying to be considerate, but I guess milk tea would've been better.

"I'm sorry. It's bitter, right? I'll go make another one, so you don't have to drink it."
"Ehno, that's not true. Um, it was very delicious."

I don't know where she learned the manners, but Ilya bows.
And she slowly starts to sip on the tea.

"......"
...Well, if she wants to drink it, I shouldn't stop her.
The Japanese snack, on the other hand...

...Seems to be well-received, so I'll sit here and keep her company.

Once we finish the tea, Ilya asks me if we can explore my house.

"I'm fine with that, but there's nothing interesting."
"I just want to check it out. I knew this place had low magical value when I came in here, so all you have to do is show me around."

That's her reply.
So I end up giving her a tour of my home, but...

"Hmm. This place is smaller than I thought. One side of the corridor is glass. It'll be troublesome when you get attacked here."

"This is Shirou's room!? No way, a person can't live here!"

"This is your yard? Japanese magi must have it tough. You can't grow anything in such a small garden."

"I know this. This is called a dojo, right?
 My grandfather told me you people are savages that slash at each other bare-footed."

"No! I don't want to see inside your storage room! You have servants to take care of that!"

...She complains a lot.
But it seems she's having fun.

"What's next!? We haven't gone over there! Let's go, Shirou!"
She urges me.

"...Fine, fine. Then let's go to the back. It's dirty because we haven't used it for a few years, but don't worry about it."
Ilya runs across the hallway in joy.

"Phew."
But...
I don't know what she's so happy about, but I'm glad I'm showing her around if it's this fun for her.

But.
Ilya must be getting tired, as she loses her spirit halfway through the tour.
Ilya silently looks around the rooms.
Once we've seen everything, we return to the living room.

"That's all. Well, there's also the outbuilding, but you'll have to excuse me for not showing it to you.
 Saber is sleeping there right now."
Ilya looks downcast.

"I see. So this is all?"
"...Ilya? What's wrong? Are you tired?"

"Yeah, I'm a bit tired. There's nobody here, after all."
She looks like a normal girl of her age.

...Ilya is acting like Ilya, and not like a strong Master.
"I came to take revenge. But it's sad that the person to take revenge on isn't here anymore."
She murmurs to herself, tears silently trickling down her face.

"Huh? That's strange. I think I'm crying. There was nothing sad or scary."
Ilya tilts her head in wonder, as if it's a really odd thing.


There's probably a reason for it.
There's no one in this house.
The target she has a grudge against.
She only wanted to kill him, but the chance has been forever lost.
...Ilyasviel von Einzbern.
She has a reason to kill me and Kiritsugu.
It's because

"Let's go, Shirou. The sun's going to set soon.
 We'll have to fight unless I leave this place before nightfall."
...Ilya is smiling.
What can I say back to her?

"Yeah, you're right. Then I'll see you off to the park."
"Okay. You sure know how to treat a lady."
She smiles innocently.
Her silver hair fluttering behind her, Ilya runs to the front door as if nothing has happened.

...And I part with her for the third time.
My legs are heavy on the way home.
I slowly walk through the streets, as if for the first time.


I have so much to think about.
Foremost in my mind...  I'm finally realizing how important Ilya is.

"...Father. Ilya is"
Should I fight her as a Master?
Or should I convince her to forfeit?

'Makiri and Einzbern have deep tenacities.
 They have desired the Holy Grail for over 500 years and 1000 years.'

That's what Kotomine said.
Is there a way to separate Ilya from people who have sought the Holy Grail for so long?
...No, even before that.
I have no idea how to quench her desire for revenge.

I return to my house.
The sun is about to set, coloring the town with its reddish glow.

"All right. I have to pull myself together."
I slap my cheeks.
I'll have to deal with Shinji and Ilya sooner or later, but defeating Caster, the one still attacking the people in this town, takes priority now.

I won't let an event like the one that took place ten years ago take place again.
That's why I decided to become a Master and fight alongside Saber.
As long as I've broken my promise with her, all my explanations will be excuses.
I have to do something to earn her forgiveness, but I don't know what will please her.
Thenwhy don't I do anything she wishes, like a Servant under a Command Spell?

"Why are you silent? I won't be deceived by that face. I'm not going to apologize if you're not either. If you don't like me, then I'll"

"I've decided. A Servant. I'll be your Servant just this once in compensation for breaking my promise."
"...Turn you into a doll... Wait, a Servant!?"

"Yeah. There's nothing I can do that will keep my promise, right? So I'll obey you just once. Wouldn't that make you feel a bit better?"

"
 No, you're lying! You didn't come to the park. A verbal promise ends right away, so I won't trust your words."

"I know. That's why I'm going to obey you, like you used a Command Spell. You'll only be able to use it once, but I won't break my promise with you, no matter what. Will you trust me if that's the case?"

"T-Trust you...? But I don't have a Command Spell I can use against you..."

"No, but I'll keep my promise. There's no contract or Command Spell, but I'll treat it like an order from a Command Spell.
 We're both Masters. I swear on my Crest that I won't betray something I recognize as a Command Spell."

I swear while looking Ilya in the eyes.
The silver-haired girl gasps and...
"...Will you really do anything I say?"
...Stares back at me uneasily.

"Of course. It's a Command Spell we're talking about. I'll do anything, as long as it's possible for me to do."
I reply to her wary gaze with a big smile.

"......"
A long silence.
Ilya averts her eyes and clenches her fists.

"......Okay. Then, I want......"
"Huh...?"
Did I mishear her?
It's a Command Spell we're talking about here, but her wish is a small one.

"Ilya...? Hold on, it's a Command Spell. I'm going to do anything you say. Are you sure that's all you want?"

"......"
"Don't you have anything else? That's too easy. You don't have to hold back, so give me a better"
"I-I'm not holding back! You liar! You said you'd do anything!"

"Uh, but... is that really all you want!? Because such a trifling matter..."
...It's something I'd easily be able to do, even without a Command Spell forcing me.

"...It's not trivial. I've always wanted to do something like that. So that's what I want from you right now, Shirou."
Her face is all red, and she's trembling out of fear of getting rejected.

"Ilya."
There's no way I can question her now.
No matter how trivial it may be, it's her wish.
ThenI have to protect her as her knight.

"All right. I'm sorry for saying such a stupid thing.
 Let's go, Ilya. It's a small shopping district, but it should be fun with the two of us."

I can feel my face heating up as I say the embarrassing words.
My face is turning red.
But I hold my hand out to Ilya without trying to hide it.

Ilya's wish really is trivial.
'Take me shopping.'
It's not a big wish.
She asked for an everyday event.

...I don't know how much meaning her wish held for her.
We walk through the shopping district not like Masters, but like siblings.
Ilya runs through the familiar scenery with lit up eyes.

Seeing her high spirits lifts my own.
Ilya walks on with a carefree smile.
Her merry attitude makes me wish this time would last forever.

But I finally realize.
She runs as if dancing, never ceasing her smile.
But there's no happiness there.
She's smiling desperately because she's sadand because she doesn't want this dream to end.

"Come over here, Shirou! The coffee's gonna get cold!"
A hot can must be interesting for her, as she runs to the park with both our drinks in hand.

The end comes, no matter how much I wish for this not to end and no matter how much I bite my lips for her to not push herself.
The shopping district here is small.
No matter how slowly we take it, we can work our way through the whole place in about an hour.

"We're here! We're at the final station.
 You can rest now, Shirou. Thanks for all the work until now."

Ilya turns to me.
I sit down on the bench, thinking that she must want to rest here.

...But.
Even though she suggested it, Ilya does not sit down.

"Ilya? Aren't you sitting down?"
"Here's your drink, Shirou. You get coffee, and I get sweet red-bean soup."

Ilya takes my drink from her pocket and hands it to me.
...The only item she asked me to buy her was her drink.

"But how did you know about sweet red-bean soup? They don't have it back home, right?"
"Right. It's the first time I've ever seen it. I was told I shouldn't be able to drink it because it's too sweet."

Ilya takes a step, smiling.
She twirls to the middle of the park.

"Ilya...?"
"I'll lift the Command Spell here. It was only a short while, but thanks, Shirou."
Her voice is clear.
Smiling resolutely, Ilya announces that her dream has come to an end.

"Wha'thanks'? Why? It hasn't even been an hour yet. We can go to Shinto if you're bored with the shopping district. That place is far better than..."

"It's fine. This is the last stop, after all. It was fun, but the shopping ends here. The sun's going to set soon, so let's go back to our previous relationship.
 I'm a Master who came to kill Shirou, and you're fighting me for your own good. Our relationship was set in stone before we met."

How can I respond to that?
Ilya yearns for ordinary life more than me, but she casts away her wishes far more readily.

"I see. Then when we leave this park..."
"Yes, we'll be enemies. If we meet again during nighttime, we'll have to continue the fight.
 If you don't want me to kill you, you'll have to kill me first."

I stop my breath for a second and look up at the sky.
The sky is gray.
The happy time quickly ended, and the town is covered with a heavy canopy.
 Even though I wished for this time to last forever, I knew it was going to end like this when I realized this is only a painful experience for Ilya.

The girl said this the farthest end.
The final station.
Ilya keeps smiling innocently in this place without destination or backtrack.

"Wow! It's snowing, Shirou!"
Her lively voice catches my attention.
A distant scenery is in front of me when I look back at the park.

I doubt for a second, thinking it's an illusion.
It's not because of the snow, but because of the dancing girl.


The snow must be temporary.
It looks like it'll stop soon.

...Within the indistinct winter, Ilya is completely surrounded in white snow.
The silver-haired girl is playing in the temporary snow as if loved by winter.

"Aha, the snow in this town is warm. This is the first time I've seen normal snow."
I don't know what's so fun, but Ilya keeps twirling around.

"You're energetic. Do you like snow, Ilya?"
"Yeah. I don't like cold things, but I like the snow. It's kind and like my mom. I was praised that my hair is white and feminine."

She makes a big smile.
By watching her, I can tell who praised her.

"It's beautiful. So it snows in the land Kiritsugu used to live in, huh?"

Her smile isn't directed at me.
...Ilyasviel von Einzbern.
The white girl that came to kill my father.
Why she was after Kiritsugu, why she wants to kill me...
...These things I already know.

The man that betrayed Einzbern.
Kiritsugu abandoned everything and started living in this town.
I, an unrelated child, pursued him as his son.
I didn't learn about all the sacrifices that made this life possible until I became a Master.

The snow keeps falling as if to hide Ilya.
The girl from a distant foreign country says goodbye with a smile.

"Good-bye, Shirou. I'll play with you again if I ever see you walking around alone!"

The white girl leaves the park with an innocent smile.

As though her presence was what sustained it, the snowfall slackens and dies.
A temporary illusion.
I brush off the snow crystals that never had a chance to pile up and leave the station of the farthest end.
It can't be helped if I forgot about it. I'll have her forgive me.

"I'm sorry. I met somebody who I didn't expect, and I forgot all about our promise. I'll be more careful next time, so please forgive me."
I bow my head in apology.

"...I see. You try to cover for yourself with simple words? I thought you were different from Kiritsugu, but you're the same after all."
"EhIlya?"

"No, that makes it even more fun for me. I'll turn you into my toy, just as I planned."
"...!?"

I feel a chill.
Ilya's eyes emit murderous intent, just like the night we met for the first time.

"See you again, Onii-chan. I'll let you go today, but you'll have to be careful the next time we meet."
Without waiting for a response, she turns and dashes off.
"Hey, Ilya...!"

I run after her, but I lose sight of her.

"...I guess I angered her."
...I failed.
I should've put more thought into it before I apologized to her.

"Man. Either way, I have to come up with a plan before I see her again."
I don't want to be on bad terms with Ilya.
I'll come up with some way to make it up to her
"Huh?"
I see Sakura's shoes.
Considering the time, I bet Sakura's already back from her club.

"I'm home... Oh. You're asleep, Sakura?"
Her club practice must have been tiring, as Sakura is sleeping in the living room.
She must be exhausted, as she is lying on the floor rather than having her head on the table.

"...Yeah. She was sick, but she went to school and her club, and helped around with my house on top of that. You're working way too hard, Sakura."
I go past the living room, trying not to wake her up.
And...
I bring a blanket from my room.

"Here. You'll catch cold again if you sleep without a blanket."
I carefully drape the blanket over her.
Then.

"Hm... Sen... pai..."
She must be half asleep, as Sakura looks up at me with empty eyes.

"!"
Her gesture... is different.
It's not the Sakura I know who stands and smiles in the kitchen wearing an apron. Umher gesture is more erotic than I've ever seen on her.

"I-I brought a blanket, Sakura"
Nervously, I try to explain myself.
At that instant
Sakura's arms wrap around my neck.


Her breath is near me.
I'm intensely aware of her femininity, no matter how hard I try to ignore it.

"HeySakura"
I can't breathe or talk properly.
Sakura is half-asleep.
You need only look at her eyes to see that.
So I have to shake her off me. I have to get away from her, but

"Ahuh."
I can't take my eyes off of her.

...Her hair streams down her neck.
Her lips let out a seductive sigh, and her breasts are pushing up her shirt.
Having her mature woman's body so close is making me dizzy.

"Sen... pai..."
Her hands tense up a bit.
...Our faces near each other.
I'm entranced by her lips, unable to resist.


My reasoning is frozen.
Everything I've prohibited, everything I shouldn't have noticed... such boring senses are being destroyed.

"Sa... kura..."
My heart is pounding.
The sound of the pounding heart fills my eardrums, my head empties out, and

"Are you home, Shirou?"
"UWAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"

I jump back.
I display speed and quick-wittedness I've never shown before and land on top of the table...!

"That was a wonderful movement. But I do not know about landing on the table."
"You're right. I was a bit surprised."
I slowly step down to the floor.
Sakura is

"Hm... Hmm..."
Her hands are lowered, and she's sleeping again.

"Shirou? Your face is red. Did something happen? Your eyes are wandering. Are you worried about something?"
"I-It's nothing! Let's just go to the dojo. Sakura needs sleep, and I want to train with you until dinner."

"That is an excellent attitude to take, Shirou. I am well rested and in perfect condition. Let us prepare for tonight's battle."
Saber heads to the dojo without questioning my suspicious behavior.

"Phew."
I-I'm saved.
I'm glad Saber didn't see us like that, but I'm more glad that I didn't do anything on the spur of the moment.
...If I'd done anything to Sakura while she was half-asleep, I would kill myself out of shame.
The moon darkens.
The clouds, blown by the strong wind, hide the white moon.

We go outside, careful not to wake Sakura.
It's eleven o'clockwe decided to start patrolling earlier to make up for yesterday.

The town has continued to suffer while my guard was down after Caster's defeat.
If Caster is still alive and collecting energy from people, I have to defeat her for sure tonight.

We descend the hill to the intersection.
The question is where to go from here

"Shirou. I feel a Servant's presence."
"...! Is it close, Saber?"
"It should not be a problem distance-wise. Even with your speed, we should be able to catch up to the Servant in about five minutes.
 Please give me an order, Master."

Saber is asking me if we should follow them or stay here and keep watch.
I don't even need to think about it.

"Let's go. Lead the way, Saber."
Saber starts to run.
She heads eastit seems she is heading to the big bridge connecting Miyama City and Shinto.

"......!"
The instant I step into the park, the abnormal presence makes me feel like vomiting.
The air is polluted here.
The stench of rot and decay seeps into my nose.

"Uh... guh."
My gastric juice is regurgitated just by standing here.
The discomfort and the dizziness almost break my mind.

"Look, Shirou!"
"......!"
I suppress my nausea and look.
There

"E-Emiya-kun...!?"
"...Saber."
...Stand Tohsaka and Archer, with their backs to us...

"Hm? New enemies?"
...And that old manMatou Zouken.


I understand the situation right away.
Tohsaka is fighting Matou Zouken.

I see dozens of something so small that I can't distinguish it around Tohsaka.
Tohsaka's Servant Archer has many more around him.
It seems Matou Zouken used those things to attack them.

"Hm. Well, if it isn't Saber's Master.
 So you've prepared a backup?  For Tohsaka's daughter, you are surprisingly smart."

"You're wrong. Archer and I are more than enough to beat a confession out of you.
 They're just spectators. They have nothing to do with me."
Tohsaka keeps glaring at Matou Zouken.

...But her back is...
"What were you thinking, coming at a time like this!? Do you want to die!?"
...Harshly scolding me.

"Shirou."
"...I know. This isn't the time to be arguing with Tohsaka."
Just as how Tohsaka does not look away from that old man, I'm feeling danger from him.

...A monster said to have survived by sucking people's blood.
A descendant of Makiri who tried to obtain the Holy Grail and made Shinji into a Master.
There's no way such a guy would just stand there and not do anything.

"Hm. I wanted to keep this hidden, but I guess it cannot be helped. I cannot survive against two Servants."

He makes a sound with his cane.
The instant it strikes the bricks beneath the old man's feet...

...Someone we already defeated appears to protect him.

"Caster...! Damn, so she really is still alive...!"
"Please stay back, Shirou. That is Caster, but not Caster. ...Her appearance and abilities are the same, but I do not feel her will or her soul.
 That thing is an imitation made from Caster's corpse."

Saber steps forward.
In her hand is the invisible sword.

"Oh. As expected from Saber. You saw through my trick right away. Oh my, no wonder Shinji's Rider was no match for you.
 Archer should not be a match against you, just like Caster, who was defeated without being able to do anything."

"Is that all you have to say for yourself?
 Deceiving us is the least of your crimes.
 Even though Caster is our enemy, she is a heroic spirit chosen as a Servant. You better have an appropriate determination if you are trifling with her corpse."

"Oh. I only picked up some trash that nobody needed any longer.
 I do not mind being called a heretic for that, but you would fall lower than a brute if that is the case.
 You are the greatest Servant, after all.
 Then it is best to make you, rather than this corpse, into my slave. I shall let my worms eat you alive and have you follow this corpse's fate."

"You."
"Kakaka, why are you enraged!? Servants are merely tools! It does not matter how they are used! It is the same whether you bind them with a Command Spell or if you use them as a corpse! Then is it not for your sake to turn you into a mindless puppet!?"

The two Servants charge.
Saber and Archer charge at the laughing monster as if they planned the attack.

Two blades slice through Caster.
The match was decided from the start.

Caster cannot defeat Saber.
Even with Matou Zouken's control, that fact has not changed.
Caster's magic does not reach Saber, and Saber finishes off the enemy she defeated before.

Caster's body begins to disintegrate.
Saber stands by and watches it until the end.

To ensure that it completely disappears.
To ensure that her body will not be violated again.

"Archer...!"
It's Tohsaka's voice.
Matou Zouken has disappeared.
He sacrificed Caster in order to make his escape.
But

"Hm!?"
That is why Saber took care of Caster.

Archer ignored her completely, pursued the controller, and...
"That's it."
...Cut Matou Zouken's body in half.

"Guh"
Zouken's upper body falls to the ground.

"Hm, ugh, my!"
A dragging sound.
Even though blood and entrails are spilling from his bisected body, the old man still lives.
He crawls across the ground with his arms, trying to get away from Archer.

"This is the end, magus. My past experiences have taught me to quickly finish off monsters like you."

Archer raises his shortsword above Zouken.
This is the end.
No matter how immortal Matou Zouken may be, he will die once his head is crushedand he is almost dead already.

It is not like he has self-healing powers like the Servants, and his horrific wound is taking him closer to death by the second.
But, unwilling to take any chances, Archer kills the magus with his shortsword.

"What?"
No, he tries to kill Zouken and stops.


It's not only Archer who felt it.
Everybody here does.
Tohsaka and Saber.
Archer and I.
Even Matou Zouken, hovering on the edge of death, trembles at its appearance.

Darkness covers the park.

The damp air freezes in an instant.
My heart is beating at a higher pitch, but the rate is slower.
Something bad is close by.
So I have to run away.
I can't concern myself with that thing.
My body understands it instinctively, yet it refuses to move.

It's meaningless to run away.
My body knows that I can't escape.


I move my trembling body and turn my numb neck.
I look towards the entrance of the park.
There...
...Stands the "shadow".


Space is distorted.
I want to believe it's just my imagination, a product of the disordered sense of balance caused by extreme tension.

I've never seen anything like it.
It's insubstantial, as if a shadow suddenly stood up.
Its existence is so light that it could be blown away.

And yet, its presence dominates this place.

It lacks intelligence or reason, and it probably is not even alive.
The black shadow stands there like a mirage.
So...

  Why do I find it so familiar?

"Impossible"
I hear a hoarse voice.
The only one able to speak here happens to be the dying old man.

"Impossible, impossible, impossible!"
He crawls while screaming.
Matou Zouken pulls himself away from Archer and out of the park.

...It's not that Zouken had that much strength left.
It's just that...
Fear of the shadow drove him.


Nobody is able to move.
Tohsaka and I stand still, transfixed by fear.
Even Saber and Archer seem entranced.

It's like a deep sea monster.
The shadow sways in the silent world where everything is still.

And...
It shows something like a will for the first time.

"Ah"
It lacks eyes, limbs, or a body.
Yet it still casts a shadow at its base.
Outlined by the moonlight, the shadow begins to stretch and elongate.
Like a snake that has found its prey, it points at Tohsaka and


Oblivious to the change, Tohsaka does not move.
Saber is too far away. Archer has started running, but he is too far away to make it in time.

"Toh"
The shadow lashes out.
Without showing any sign, the shadow abruptly covers tens of meters and...

"saka, watch out...!!!!!"
I frantically push Tohsaka aside.

"     -kun...!?"
I can't hear her voice.
The instant I push Tohsaka away, something engulfs me.
A splashing sound and a sensation of something trying to crush my body.

", Ah."

My presentiment wasn't wrong.
Water has come crashing in around me, and I am now sinking into the sea.

But it's hot.
This seawater is too hot.
Boiling coal tar.
It sticks to my skin and cuts off my life, and I don't feel like I'm in the sea.

"Ahguh."
I feel sick.
I feel sick, it's wrong, I feel sick, it's wrong, I-I-I-I-I feel sick, it's wrong, I feel sick, i-i-i-it's wrong, I fEEl SiCK, iT'S wRoNg, I FEel sIcK iT'S WrOnG, I FeEL SIcK iT's wROnG I feEl siCk...!!!
Rabbit's corpse. One eye missing. Rotten, soft, and fresh. Forced into my mouth. Rabbit's corpse smears my esophagus. A clear sensation of eating a life. Life is life, even if it is rotten. It's real. I can't taste this with cooked food. It feels good. There's no taste. But I'm forced to eat it as long as it is in front of me. A popular place. A big line. A place that will eat rabbits. There is only one clerk. The line consists of rabbits. Lines and lines. They rot as soon as they get in the line. Infested with maggots. Which is rotten? Which is infested with maggots? Which is alive? Which is doing the eating
My body is melting.
         My mind is melting.
           My soul is melting.

"Agh"
The black fingers wrap around me.
It tries to eat abundantly and greedily, without the slightest opening.
"Ah"
My body falls into a sea of black mud.
The surface is far away, and I sink without end.
It reinforces and embraces me, carefully and without exception.


My limbs disappear.
My body turns black, and I become a part of it and fall downward to my final destination.
"......Kun, Emiya-kun...!"
"Agh... gu."
I wake up.

...My body is hot.
My nausea isn't fading, my head is shaking, and I can't even stand up by myself.

"Are you awake!? Can you tell who I am...!?"
She slaps my cheeks.

"...I can tell. Only Tohsaka would slap someone at a time like this."
"Good. I guess you're all right if you can talk back like that."
...That was just my honest opinion right now.

"You idiot, why are you smiling? ...I'm not going to thank you, okay? Don't ever do that again. I can't return the favor if you die trying to save me."

...She glares at me.
But Tohsaka is still rubbing my back with one hand and holding my hand in the other to check my temperature.

"...Tohsaka. What happened to that weird thing?"
"It disappeared. It vanished when you stepped onto the shadow and fainted. ...I think it came from over that way."

Tohsaka looks southwest and grits her teeth.

"...I see. But I think I was entangled in it for a while."
"...Really? It hasn't even been ten seconds since you pushed me. Here's the proof, see."

"Shirou...!"
Saber runs up to me.
"You acted reckless again...!"
Saber supports me and pulls me away from Tohsaka.

"Get away, Archer's Master. I shall treat you as an enemy if you come any closer to my Master."
"What? I'm your enemy as well?"

"Of course. You are a Master, and Archer is with you.
 I do not know why Shirou protected you, but I cannot let you near my Master before my eyes."

Saber glares at Tohsaka.
...Crap, I guess I never told Saber about our current truce.

"...No, you're wrong, Saber. We're at peace right now, so until we defeat Caster"
"Shirou!? Please get yourself together...!"
"...I'm saying Tohsaka isn't our enemy. I promised her."

"......! Understood. I will not fight her if that is your will."
"...Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't talk... anymore..."

I endure the nausea and the chill that tries to get me unconscious.
...I have to get home before I faint.
I have to stay conscious until then.

"So you survived, huh? Well, you didn't touch the main body, so the most that it can do is make you ill."
Archer approaches.
Archer is expressionless even though Zouken got away, and he is the only calm one here.

"...Archer. Do you know what that shadow is?"
"Who knows? But one thing is clear. That shadow is what's been draining the life from the townspeople ever since Caster's death."

...He answers as if he's not interested.
Then Archer looks down at me, lying on the ground.

"It seems this is no time to pursue personal grudges.  Isn't that right, Emiya Shirou?"
"...What?"
"As for what that shadow was, your intuition is correct.
 ...Humph. I am summoned as a Servant, but I'm to fight it after all."

"Archer...? Who are you?"
"I see. You are not a guardian yet. Then you must not have fought something like that before. ...Man, it seems I'll be doing the same thing no matter where I go."

...The knight in red beckons Tohsaka to go.
But right before they leave...

"...No, it's not that hopeless.
 It has not occurred yet. I might be able to finish it beforehand, or I might end up cleaning after the event. I have a chance of stopping it this time."
He looks up at the sky and murmurs these words.

...It switches off and on.
The heat permeates my body and I don't feel like I'm walking.

Is it because someone told me this is like a disease?
It feels like plagued maggots are filling my whole body.

"S-Senpai...!?"

...I can't tell dream and reality apart.
I feel like I'm already asleep and trying to go back to my room.

"Sakura...? Were you not asleep?"
"Please move aside. You'll hurt Senpai if you hold him like that."

"No, this is my duty.
 And if this is a disease, you might get infected as well."
"...I'm not talking about that.
 Saber-san. I don't know what you two are doing. I knew you wouldn't answer me even if I asked, so I never did."

"But Senpai has seemed troubled ever since you came here.
 ...I could still bear that, but tonight you've brought him home injured."
"Sakura, that is..."

"I don't know what your circumstances are. But isn't there a better way to go about this?
 If you can'tplease at least resolve your problems without involving Senpai."

...I return to my room.
It feels like someone is next to me, putting me to sleep.

", "

A voice is whispering in my ear, but I can't make out the words.
Did it apologize, it's my fault?
Did it apologize, I'm sorry?

Whatever the words are, they're the last thing I hear.
My consciousness fades as soon as I lie down.
The scene keeps squirming like insects until the very end.
When I wake up, my body has fully recovered.
My temperature is normal, and my limbs don't feel heavy at all.

"It's before six o'clock. I wonder if Sakura's awake?"
If she is, she'll probably be preparing breakfast.
I'd better get ready quickly and head to the kitchen, or Sakura will finish it herself.

"I'm going ahead, Saber. Come to the living room in a bit."
I don't have the guts to look inside her room, so I retreat after calling out to her.
It'll be troublesome if I see Saber sleeping.

"And my dad collapsed.
 He was like, 'your father is sick in bed, so don't you think you should settle down?'
 Isn't that rude? He makes it sound like I'm a wandering cloud."

Fuji-Nee complains while eating.
It seems Fuji-Nee didn't come over last night because her father collapsed.

"...? Senpai, what is this wandering cloud?"
"It's describing Fuji-Nee. It's an airy person without a definite character."
I answer without hesitation.

"You're wrong! A wandering cloud is an idler!
 It's what you call a person who does nothing but go around town to mock people."

Sakura and Saber nod in comprehension.
I do not even need to mention which part they agree on.

"So, Sensei. Is your father sick?"
"Of course not. My family is famous for not getting sick. My dad sumo wrestled with one of the younger guys and hurt his hips."
"Sumo...? What is this 'sumo', Taiga?"

"Huh? It's kinda hard to explain in words. It's a type of martial art where you push, push instead of pull, push and push. You can't use weapons, and you can't use a fist. You also can't kick.
 You basically grapple with your opponent and win by knocking your opponent down to the ground."

"...Hm. So is it a pure contest of power?"
"Yup. And you don't wear any clothes. You and your opponent grapple pretty much naked."

"N-Naked...!?"
"Yup. Well, your weak point is covered by a mawashi. Oh, that's a sumo wrestler's loincloth, by the way. If you don't understand, ask Shirou about it. He knows more than I do."
Fuji-Nee says something absurd as she sips on her miso soup.

"I see. So, Shirou. What is this loincloth?"

It's easy to explain, but I'm a bit hesitant to talk about it.
I'm talking to Saber, and we're eating right now.
Why do I have to talk about loincloths during a meal?

"...I don't know. Sumo is out of my area of expertise, so ask someone else."
"You're lying! You have a loincloth too!"

"I-I don't! I had to do sumo because your grandfather made me, and I only borrowed one then!
 First of all, that happened years ago!"

"Ahahaha, you're right. You kept losing because you were small back then. My gramps told you to do a different sport because you wouldn't give up until you won, so he made you start archery."

"......"
Fuji-Nee is laughing cheerfully.
...Man.
Fuji-Nee is in high spirits this morning, so she's louder than usual.

"Hey, Fuji-Nee. It's almost time. You'll be late unless you leave here before seven o'clock."
"Huh? Oh, it's fine today. Morning club activities are cancelled starting today. ...Well, I still have to leave early because there's a teachers' meeting."

"Huh? The morning practice for the archery club is cancelled as well?"
"Yup. Oh, I see. You didn't hear about it, huh? There was an incident yesterday, and some people in the track team got injured during practice. but they got injured during practice. I guess it's because of lack of sleep, so morning practices will be cancelled for a while."

"...I see. But they cancelled all the practices because of one injured person?
 Lack of sleep is that person's"
It's their own fault, unless...

"Fuji-Nee. How many people were injured?"
"...Hmm. It's between ten and twenty students."

"T-That many?
 What about the people in the archery club?"

"Well, nobody in our club got hurt, but a few people looked tired yesterday.
 ...And it's been dangerous recently, right? We can't just ignore the mental strain it might be causing, so I guess the school's trying to decrease the burden. I don't know about the clubs being a mental burden, but it's true that they physically tire you."
Fuji-Nee shrugs and holds out her bowl.

"Can I have another bowl, Sakura-chan? I just want it half-full."
"Of course. You're not eating a lot this morning, Sensei."
"Yeah. My stomach is hurting because I know there's a lot of work waiting for me at school, so I don't have any appetite."

Fuji-Nee pretends to cry.
Hmm.
It seems the tiger at my house wants us to believe that two and a half bowls of rice isn't her normal serving.

"You're full of energy in contrast, Sakura-chan. You're on your second full bowl."
"I'm still growing. I get hungry quickly, so I have to push myself and eat extra."

Sakura puffs up with pride.
...Well.
I don't know about that being part of the growing thing... But maybe all the gluttons around her are influencing her.

"I see. Sakura does not have sufficient strength as an archer. It is good to take in extra energy."
Saber nods as she keeps eating.
...Is it just me, or is she missing the original topic?
It's past seven o'clock.
Fuji-Nee left for school, and we're cleaning now.
Sakura has time as well, so we relax and do the dishes.

With the two of us, it doesn't take long.
...I was keeping an eye on Sakura because of her health, but she really seems okay now.
It looks like her fever's gone, and she's full of energy.

"U-Um, Senpai...!
 I-I have something to tell you, so could you spare me some time!?"

Then.
Sakura stammers a question, looking as nervous as if she were breaking into somebody's house.

"Sure. We still have time."
"O-Okay. ...U-Um, well. I made, um, some lunch for you..."
She looks down as she hands me a lunchbox.

It's not my usual lunchbox, and it seems Sakura prepared it for me.
It has a cute shape, and it's wrapped in vivid colors.
The taste is guaranteed if Sakura made it, and I appreciate the fact that someone made lunch for me.

"Uh, thanks. ...Wait, did you wake up early to make me lunch?"
Sakura was done with cooking breakfast when I came to the living room this morning.
I admired how early she got up, but it seems she actually woke up earlier than I thought.

"Oh, yes. Um, I woke up early, and I didn't have anything to do, so I thought I'd make lunch. ...Um, and I want to ask you about something"
"...? Why are you all formal? Do you need to consult me about something important?"

"N-No, it's nothing big...!
 It's not, but...... umm... oh, yes! S-Senpai, you don't make lunch that often. You like cooking, so I'm wondering why!"
"...Sakura. It's not like I like to cook."

I don't know about a guy's hobby being cooking, so I wish she'd keep it as something I can do.
Oh, wait. We're talking about why I don't make my own lunch.

"Well. I know it's cheaper to make my own lunch. But the guys in my class crowd around it if I do make it. Half my lunch is taken away before I know it."

Sakura nods in satisfaction.
...To be accurate, it's the girls that take most of my lunch, but I don't say it because it's too pathetic.

"Yeah, so I only make lunch when I can use the student council room. Then, I can eat alone with Issei."

"...U-Um, Senpai? How about eating at the archery range in that case?
 It's open during lunchtime, I can make you some tea, and it's quiet there"

...?
Oh, that's a good idea.
The archery range isn't locked, and the club members rarely go there during lunchtime.
Mitsuzuri might be there, but she's not so cruel as to eat someone else's lunch.

"...Yeah, you're right. That's a good idea."
"Y-Yes!
 It is a good idea! Then, um"
"But I don't know about an outsider going in there. I guess we have to ask Mitsuzuri for permission."

"I-It's all right! The archery range is part of the school, so any student should be able to use it when the archery club isn't using it!"
Sakura presses her point.

"...Hmm, you're right. I guess it's fine if I'm not causing anyone trouble."
I nod to myself.
Then.
I don't know why, but Sakura is making a victory pose with a big smile.

"...?"
...Hmm. Maybe some of Fuji-Nee's energy transferred to Sakura.
"WhaCaster hasn't disappeared?"
"Correct. You defeated Caster two days ago, right?
 But the coma incidents happened again yesterday.
 ...The people who had their magical energy sucked out yesterday are in a worse coma than before."

"No way. We definitely..."
"I know. You wouldn't lie, and I don't think you made a misunderstanding. ...But Archer and I saw a shadow that looked like Caster when we went to the scene of the crime yesterday."

"......I see. Then Caster's still alive and collecting magical energy from all over town?"

"...I'm not certain, but it seems so. But I can tell that the atmosphere at the Ryudou Temple has changed.
 You two defeated Caster. But she still exists. That's all I'm sure of right now."

Tohsaka looks unhappy.
...This explains why she feels different from yesterday.

Tohsaka is probably getting doubts about this war.
A Servant disappears if its Master is defeated.
A Servant cannot avoid death in this world if it is completely defeated.
But Caster still exists, in spite of taking both these penalties.
She is a "violation" that completely overthrows the fundamentals of the Holy Grail War.

"I see. So, what do you think?"
"Huh? Me?"

"Yeah. You think it's strange, right?
 I don't think you'll forfeit from the Holy Grail War. But don't you want to clear up this thing about Caster before you start fighting for the Holy Grail? You want to put off fighting other Masters until after that, right?"

"You're right.
 This Holy Grail War is suspicious. It seems different from the one I heard about from my dad. I think there's something different going on where we can't see it."

...Different, huh?
I don't have the liberty to think about such a thing because the Holy Grail War itself is beyond my comprehension.
But if a legitimate Master like Tohsaka feels that way, it must be true.

"Then Tohsaka..."
"Yes. I won't follow the rules of the Holy Grail War until I'm convinced. It can't be helped if I'm being used, but I don't like not knowing the harm I may be imposing on others.
 You don't like such a thing, right? So I'm not going to be fighting other Masters until I get this cleared up."

She declares her stance.
Tohsaka's eyes show her determination, and it seems to be asking for my stance.

"I see. Can I take that as a truce offer?"
"If you would accept it. If you won't fight me until this case is settled, I won't hurt you either."

Tohsaka asks me silently with her eyes.
She doesn't even need to ask.

"That's my line. I won't fight you as long as you don't come attacking me.
 ...And even if there comes a time when we do fight, it'll be fair and square. Until then"
I want to cooperate with Tohsaka.

"Then it's decided. I expected you to agree, but I'm glad to hear it all the same."
"Huh...?"
Tohsaka holds out her right hand.
I realize that she's wanting to shake hands, and...
"Y-Yeah. P-Please give me your best regards."
I try to suppress my face from turning red as I shake her hand.

"All right, our contract is set. Please give me your best regards too, Emiya-kun."

...Tohsaka firmly shakes my hand.
Her hand is soft, much more delicate than mine.
"!"
I-I'M AN IDIOT!!! WHAT THE HELL AM I THINKING AT A TIME LIKE THIS!!!!?

"...? What's wrong, Emiya-kun? You're sweating all of a sudden. ...It seems your heart's beating faster too."
"...!? N-No, it's nothing, I just have a cold. I'll get well if I eat! I'll get better if I eat, so let's eat lunch!"

I quickly let go of Tohsaka's hand.
Then.
Tohsaka's expression turns wicked.

"Ohhhh. I suspected it when we last met, but it looks like my hunch was correct. You seemed like you had some experience, but you actually don't, huh?
 It's surprising, or should I say it's just as I expected?
 ...I see, I see. I seeeeee."

Tohsaka Rin stares at me from head to toe.

"W-What? Come out and say it if you want to say something. I-It's not good to stay quiet!"
"Noooothing. Don't worry. It's just that I just figured out a bit more about you. Oh, I won't say it, so you don't have to be frightened."

"...! I-I'm not frightened! Go ahead and say it if you want to!"
"Oh, can I?"
She grins.
Manhow can such an evil smile exist in this world?

"...Don't say it."
"What, I can't hear you?"

"...I'm sorry. Please don't mention it. I think it'll be shocking if I hear it. I think I'll suffer more damage if I hear it from you."

"Really? Then I guess I won't say it"
Tohsaka withdraws with an expression of victory.
And the instant I regain my peace of mind...
"You're the type that masturbates to the girl you like, right?"
"Hey, you said it, you devil!!!"
Wind enters the damp room.
From the opened door come two sets of footsteps.
One kicks the ground in a hurry, and the other is being dragged in.

"Come on, get started."
Thump.
A heavy sound echoes through the room.
It is the sound of Matou Shinji, the one who came to this room in a hurry, throwing in the person he brought with him.

The floor of the secret room is wriggling around.
The worms must be active right now, as leech-like insects are writhing all over the floor.
Matou Shinji knows what these worms are.
These are lust worms that his grandfather, Matou Zouken, raises that love human blood, semen, and marrow.

Once swarmed by these lust worms, men will have their spine crushed, brain sucked, and will be made into a cripple.
The worms will transform when attacking a woman, so that they are only able to violate her nerves. They will spread their tentacles all over her body and devour her spirit.

The lust worms will wet the woman's skin with their mucus, excite and destroy her central nerves of pleasure, and satisfy their hunger.
It must be their instincts, as the worms seem to love the woman's womb. They do not eat female flesh, but seek the organs within them.

They give the woman huge enough orgasms to fry her brain, and they go into her body to devour her placenta.
Unwilling to eat human flesh, the worms have only one way to get what they desire.
As a result, the woman's mind and body are completely violated and destroyed.
The name "lust worm" must come from such characteristics.

Matou Shinji throws the person he dragged here into the pool of such worms.

"Get started."
He talks from the top of the stairs.
Nobody, man or woman, can survive after being thrown into a swarm of lust worms.

But this person is an exception.
The worms slither away from the person.
Are they scared, or have they lost interest?
The worms do not approach the figure.
They merely reflect the light around the figure with their mucus.

"Make a 'book'. You still have two more left."
The only reply comes from the worms.
The darkness undulates as if liking the order.

"I'll let you go back if you do as I say. That's easier for you too, right?"
There's no reply.
The only sound in the room is the annoying cry of the worms.

"......! Look, fighting is the only way. If you oppose me any more"
Matou Shinji threatens to reveal everything.
The person on the floor trembles.
That is not allowed.
The old man who Matou Shinji calls master will not allow it.

But this person knows Shinji is not the type to follow his master's orders.
He is frantic right now.
Anyone that gets in his way is his enemy.
The old man forced him away from battle out of concern for his life, but the concern itself is an unforgivable insult to him.


A change occurs after a long silence.
A figure appears in a flash of light.
The worms flee to the corners of the room like an ebbing tide.
Even the worms understand how powerful the materialized woman is.

"Heh. About time."
Long hair and a slender, tall figure.
The one clothed all in black is the Servant called Rider.

"Let me confirm again, Shinji.
 You are using me solely for your protection. Correct?"
The black Servant asks.
She is looking up from the bottom of hell, from the preserve of worms.

"Yeah. It's dangerous out there, so I want a reliable guard."
Matou Shinji does not hide his joy of becoming a Master again and spits out words covered with lies.
"Huh?"
I see Sakura's shoes.
Considering the time, I bet Sakura's already back from her club.

"I'm home... Oh. You're asleep, Sakura?"
Her club practice must have been tiring, as Sakura is sleeping in the living room.
She must be exhausted, as she is lying on the floor rather than having her head on the table.

"...Yeah. She was sick, but she went to school and her club, and helped around with my house on top of that. You're working way too hard, Sakura."
I go past the living room, trying not to wake her up.
And...
I bring a blanket from my room.

"Here. You'll catch cold again if you sleep without a blanket."
I carefully drape the blanket over her.
Then.

"Hm... Sen... pai..."
She must be half asleep, as Sakura looks up at me with empty eyes.

"!"
Her gesture... is different.
It's not the Sakura I know who stands and smiles in the kitchen wearing an apron. Umher gesture is more erotic than I've ever seen on her.

"I-I brought a blanket, Sakura"
Nervously, I try to explain myself.
At that instant
Sakura's arms wrap around my neck.


Her breath is near me.
I'm intensely aware of her femininity, no matter how hard I try to ignore it.

"HeySakura"
I can't breathe or talk properly.
Sakura is half-asleep.
The biggest proof is her drowsy-looking eyes.
So I have to shake her off me. I have to get away from her, but

"Ahuh."
I can't take my eyes off of her.

...Her hair streams down her neck.
Her lips let out a seductive sigh, and her breasts are pushing up her shirt.
Having her mature woman's body so close is making me dizzy.

"Sen... pai..."
...Her hair streams down her neck.
Her hands tense up a bit.
...Our faces near each other.
I'm lured by her captivating lips, and I can't resist her.


My reasoning is frozen.
Everything I've prohibited, everything I shouldn't have noticed... such boring senses are being destroyed.

"Sa... kura..."
My heart is pounding.
The sound of the pounding heart fills my eardrums, my head empties out, and

"Are you home, Shirou?"
"UWAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"

I jump back.
I display speed and quick wittedness I've never shown before and land on top of the table...!

"That was a wonderful movement. But I do not know about landing on the table."
"You're right. I was a bit surprised."
I slowly step down to the floor.
Sakura is

"Hm... Hmm..."
Her hands are lowered, and she's sleeping again.

"Shirou? Your face is red. Did something happen? Your eyes are wandering. Are you worried about something?"
"I-It's nothing! Let's just go to the dojo. Sakura needs sleep, and I want to train with you until dinner."

"That is an excellent attitude to take, Shirou. I am well rested and in perfect condition. Let us prepare for tonight's battle."
Saber heads to the dojo without questioning my suspicious behavior.

"Phew."
I-I'm saved.
I'm glad Saber didn't see us like that, but I'm more glad that I didn't do anything on the spur of the moment.
If I'd done anything to Sakura while she was half-asleep, I would kill myself in shame.
"It's good that you're training, but you have to keep it moderate, Senpai! Jamming a finger is bad enough, but you've almost broken this one."
"Ouch...! Please put the bandage on slower, Sakura."

"Of course it hurts. It's natural to swell up if you leave such an injury alone. Please give up and consider this a divine punishment."

"......!"
Sakura tapes up my middle finger.
Her movements are quick and accurate. She must get lots of practice treating jammed fingers in archery club.
She's skillful, but isn't this a bit rough for Sakura?

"And you too, Saber-san.
 Couldn't you have gone easier if you're stronger than Senpai? Senpai's body is swollen all over. He won't even be able to take a bath tonight."

"Sakura. I do not mean to contradict you, but that is what Shirou wished for.
 I merely responded to his request.
 And Shirou is partly responsible for tonight's injury. He was the one who wished to train, but he was not concentrating at all."

Saber glares at me in complaint.
"Ugh"
There's not much I can say when she puts it like that.

"Eh...? Did you feel sick or something, Senpai?
 ...Um, it's not like you to go to the dojo with unclear motivation."

"Indeed. What was distracting you, Shirou? You were staring into empty space even when you were holding the shinai, and I felt no spirit in your attacks."

"...Well. That's, um..."
The cause is standing right here in front of me, but there's no way I can say that. Just thinking about it makes my heart jump

"Senpai?
 Does it still hurt somewhere...?"
Sakura looks at me with worry.

"......! N-No, I'm fine now! I just ate too much, so it'll help me out if you can make me some tea!"
I quickly move my face away from Sakura.

"Okay. Then I'll go brew some after-meal tea."
Sakura stands up to go to the kitchen.

"......Man."
...This is really bad for my heart.
Her body is engraved in my mind, and I get conscious of her whenever she comes near me.

"Are you fine with tea, Saber-san?"
"Yes. Please do not make it too hot."
Sakura promptly brews some tea.
...Her gestures are supposed to be familiar, but I feel like I'm seeing them for the first time.

"...!"
Damn, why do I keep remembering it?
There's something wrong with me, just like Saber said.
Just looking at Sakura reminds me of how she looked earlier... and her soft lips....

...This is just lust.
Sakura is an important underclassman and a family member to me.
Sowhy am I now conscious of her like this?


......Damn it.
I know. I really do.
Sakura is beautiful. I've been aware of it for quite a while now.
But in spite of that, I acted as her Senpai.

I like Sakura.
...Having her around became normal for me before I knew it, and I've found it to be a great comfort.

But it's always been a different sort of affection.
I've never wanted to embrace Sakura.
I knew she was a girl, but I never viewed her as someone of the opposite sex.

But now...
I'm beginning to think it's not that I never viewed her as a girl...
...But that I was trying not to view her as a girl.

"Senpai?"

"Here's some tea, Senpai."
"Ohyeah, thanks, Sakura."
"You're welcome. Thank you for dinner too, Senpai."

Sakura smiles happily.
...Seeing her smile makes me happy as well.
It seems she really liked the pork meatloaf with egg and vegetables.

Sakura hands the tea to Saber as well and sits down.
Saber must enjoy tea, as she receives it with satisfaction.

"Itadakimasu. ...But where is Taiga? I have not seen her around for a while."
"Huh? Oh, she just called and said she can't make it tonight. I didn't get the details, but she said she has to go visit the hospitals or something."

"I see. I wanted to ask her some questions, since she is more knowledgeable about your habits.
 ...I guess it cannot be helped. I shall wait until next time to strengthen you."

"Hm. Are you saying yesterday's and today's trainings were just the beginning?"

"Of course. The trainings up to now were to teach your body what you are able to do.
 From now on, we will train you to survive using your special characteristics."
"I see. That sounds hard."

"'Intense' would be the word to describe it.  Consider your training up to today to be a mere warmup."

"Whoa."
A-Are you serious?
I don't know if I should be thankful or not that Fuji-Nee isn't coming tonight.

"What was that sigh? This is for your own goodSakura?"
Saber looks at Sakura.

"Huh?"
I follow her gaze.
Hey

Sakura's breathing painfully.

"Sakura...!"
I run to her and shake her shoulders.

"Eh... eh, what's wrong, S-Senpai...!?"
"It's not 'what's wrong'! You were pushing yourself again"

...No, she's not.
She looks healthy, her shoulders aren't hot, and she's just looking up at me in wonder.

"Huh? Um, you looked like you were in pain."
"Oh, you're wrong. I just fell asleep."
Sakura smiles in embarrassment.

"...Don't scare me like that. I thought your cold got worse again."

"I'm sorry. I've been sleepy all day, and I fall asleep if I let my guard down."
"I see. Well, you were sleeping this afternoon too. You can go rest if you're tired. I'll clean up."

"Oh... O-Okay, you're right. I'll accept your offer and go rest now."
Sakura bows and exits the living room.
She's walking steadily, so I guess she's just short on sleep, like she said.

School ends, and I quickly head home.
Since all the after-school clubs have been cancelled, the front gate is crowded with students.
I look around, but I don't see Tohsaka.
I bet she's already heading to the Matou household.

"Senpai? Are you looking for someone?"
"Hm? No, I was just looking at the school. It's rare for everyone to go home like this, right?"

"You're right. But we can go home together because of that. Should we stop by the shopping district?"
"Yeah, let's buy stuff for dinner. Fuji-Nee can't come over for a while, so it'll be for me, you, and Saber."

We stop by the park after shopping.
There's no one here.
No children playing around.  No silver-haired girl in a coat.

"...There's no one here. Is this place not used that often?"

"I guess that's how it is. There were people here until the sun set when I was a child, but I guess it's like this now except for the holidays."
"I see. It's kind of lonely."

I agree and look up at the sky.
The evening sky.
The madder red sky without any birds looks lonely, just like the park.

"Let's go. You don't get this time off very often, so we should relax."
We leave the park.
With an energetic reply, Sakura follows after me.
School ends, and I quickly head home.
Since the after-school clubs have been cancelled, the front gate is crowded with students.

I look around, but I don't see Tohsaka.
I bet she's already heading to the Matou household.

"Sakura'snot around."
Sakura should head straight to my house since the club activities are cancelled.
But I didn't promise to go home with her, so I bet she already went home.

I walk up the empty hill.
It's already been six days since the Holy Grail War started.
The town seems to be slowly losing its liveliness.

".........Whoa."
I get dizzy as soon as I climb up the hill.
It feels like nausea.
A faint buzzing reaches my ears.

"What is this sound?"
The sound echoes on my eardrums even if I cover my ears.
I'm not hallucinating.
I can't be dizzy and be hearing this at the same time by pure chance.
If I get them at the same time, it should be intentional.

"Did something happen at the house...!?"
I shake off the dizziness and start running.
Saber's at the house.
As long as Saber's there, the enemy should have a hard time launching an ambush...!

I only see Saber's shoes at the front entrance.
"Good, Sakura's not home yet!"
Then there's no need to hesitate.
Even if we're under attack, Saber and I can deal with it...!

"Are you all right, Saber...!?"
I dash into the living room.
At that instant...

...The strength flees from my legs, and I sink to my knees.

"Wha"
I can't move my legs.
The buzzing rings my eardrums, and I lose my sense of balance.
I feel nauseous and cold.
Desperately, I fight it off, willing strength into my body...

...And realize that my Command Spell has lost its color.


My mind freezes.
The color of the Command Spell has faded away.
Before I can take in what it means...

"I've already dealt with Saber. I can't afford to have any more Servants go to their side."

I hear a familiar voice near me.


I bear the nausea and look up.

"I'm sorry, Onii-chan. I wanted to play for a bit longer, but then the situation changed. If you want to curse me, curse the imperfect Holy Grail."

The ringing in my ears invades my brain.
The imperceptible sound waves shut down my vision by filling themselves behind my eyeballs.

"But don't worry. I won't kill you right away.
 You're my trump card against that person. I'll destroy your body here, but I'll put your mind in a puppet.
 ...Teehee. You won't be able to move after that, but it's better than dying. Right, Onii-chan?"

The sound permeates my body.
My mind is still frozen.
In the darkness with my senses sealed, I meet my end without even realizing it.
The town falls asleep.
It's just past ten o'clock, but it seems like it's midnight.
It must be because of all the unexplained comas.
There are no lights, and nobody is walking about.

"Finding the shadow and investigating itArcher's Master has given us quite the reckless request."
"Yeah. But we have to do it. Are you against it, Saber?"

"...I told you my opinion this morning.
 So, do you have any clues? We might find ourselves being the target if we wander about aimlessly."

...A clue, huh?
I'm not positive, but
"Let's go to the Ryudou Temple again.
 ...I noticed that Caster was acting strange.  I think there's something there."

"...Yes. That mountain is filled with an ominous presence. The land there is the spiritual focus of this town. It is worth investigating, regardless of whether the shadow is there."

"Then it's decided. Let's go."
We walk to the gate.
We can reach the temple in an hour, if we hurry. We don't have any time to lose, but

"Saber?"
Saber is looking at the outbuilding.
She is looking at Sakura's room, where Sakura should now be sleeping.

"...Shirou. I have something to discuss with you. It follows this morning's conversation."
"...? You mean about Sakura?"

"Yes. Sakura's guilty conscience is too strong. She has a tendency of trying to atone for her sins in the present rather than the future."

...She must be talking about the quarrel they had yesterday.
Saber said Sakura was right, so Sakura had no reason to worry about it.

But Sakura said she was still at fault, went and apologized to Saber, and had Saber apologize to her instead.
Sakura and Saber.
Saber must be worried about the difference in their thought process.

"...What do you mean?"
"...Sakura places too much blame upon herself. She punishes herself for her errors instead of correcting them. She brands herself with her dishonor, rather than working to recover her honor. She burdens herself in a good way and a bad way."

...She talks with disgust.
It sounds like she's talking about herself more than about Sakura.

"...It was clear to me last night. She is special when she is with you, but I believe she behaves differently in other circumstances. Sakura is liberated from her guilty conscience only when she is with you."

That is the source of her concern.
Sakura should be able to live with pride without needing to rely on another.

"...I see. Sakura certainly is too shy. I'll be careful."
Now that Saber mentions it, it's not healthy for a girl Sakura's age to always be busy helping around the house.
She says it's fun to be here, but she should at least go outside to hang out once in a while.

"...Thanks for looking out for Sakura, Saber.
 I'm really happy that you're worried about her when she has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War."

"...No. I also have a guilty conscience, so it did not seem like someone else's business."

"Ohhold on, Saber. Let's go together."
We head to the gate together.
We head outside within the silence, trying not to wake Sakura up.
"...I say yesterday's park. They say the criminal returns to the scene of the crime"

"Are you saying the shadow will appear again?
 Master. Even if we are fortunate enough to find the shadow there, what would we do? It would be nice if we could defeat it there, but it will become harder to find that shadow if we let it escape. I believe your plan does not solve the main problem."

"Ugh."
Saber's right.
We don't even know what that shadow is.
So we shouldn't be trying to find the shadow right now. We should rather be trying to find out what it is, and where it's coming from.

"...I guess the Ryudou Temple then. I noticed that Caster was acting strange.  I think there's something there."

"Yes. That mountain is filled with an ominous presence. The land there is the spiritual focus of this town.
 It is worth investigating, regardless of whether the shadow is there."
"Then it's decided. Let's go."

We walk to the gate.
We can reach the temple in an hour, if we hurry. We don't have any time to lose, but

"Saber?"
Saber is looking at the outbuilding.
She is looking at Sakura's room, where Sakura should now be sleeping.

"...Shirou. I have something to discuss with you. It follows this morning's conversation."
"...? You mean about Sakura?"

"Yes. Sakura's guilty conscience is too strong. She has a tendency of trying to atone for her sins in the present rather than the future."

...She must be talking about the quarrel they had yesterday.
Saber said Sakura was right, so Sakura had no reason to worry about it.
But Sakura said she was still at fault, went and apologized to Saber, and had Saber apologize to her instead.

Sakura and Saber.
Saber must be worried about the difference in their thought process.

"...What do you mean?"
"...Sakura places too much blame upon herself. She punishes herself for her errors instead of correcting them. She brands herself with her dishonor, rather than working to recover her honor. She burdens herself in a good way and a bad way."

"...No. I also have a guilty conscience, so it did not seem like someone else's business."

"Ohhold on, Saber. Let's go together."
We head to the gate together.
We head outside within the silence, trying not to wake Sakura up.
...Matou Zouken is standing there, his figure just like before.
His body, which Archer sliced in two before my eyes, is whole once more.
The old magus that could only wait for death is laughing, as if that event was an illusion.

I don't know how he did it, but if he really did recover from that state, it's more on a level of restoration than recovery.
It's not just healing a wound.
It takes great magic to restore a piece of one's body that has been lost.
Thenisn't this called immortality?

"Well. What do you intend with a single piece of wood, child?"

I stand there while pointing the strengthened stick at Zouken.

I can't charge at Zouken, nor can I retreat to follow Saber.
...If Zouken is immortal, a scrap of wood will never be able to match him

"Will you try to kill me, or will you go after your Servant? Either way, nothing starts until you move."
Something is squirming around the old magus as he speaks.
No, it's not just his surroundings.
The darkness itself is moving, blocking the moonlight.

"Worms."
I can tell, even though I can't see them.
The darkness is probably swarms of worms.
The walls of this temple are covered in something darker than darkness itself.
This space is filled with the sound of creeping worms and the smell of rotten meat.

"Why do you hesitate? Your little alliance cut me in half only yesterday. Did you not cooperate with Tohsaka specifically to kill me?"

...It's obvious that he is enjoying this.
I can't fight off thousands of worms with just this stick.
I'll be swallowed in those worms once Zouken gives the order.

Or maybe...
I might be able to escape if I sprint for the exit.
They are just worms, even if it is a horde of them.
It should take them more than a few seconds to kill a human being.

"All right, I shall wait as long as you want.
 You can believe in Saber's return and wait here, try to kill me with that weapon of yours, or shake off my worms and try to escape outside. You can choose how you want to die."

...Humph.
It seems he has no intention of letting me go.
The worms increase in number as we stand here glaring at one another.
Then

.....No.
I can't move recklessly.
I'm worried about Saber. I want to run to her and see if she's all right.

But that means turning my back to Zouken.
In this situation, doing so will be fatal.
'Please protect yourself there, Shirou.'
That's what Saber said.
Then I have to make my stand, no matter what.

"Oh. I see, I see. You two must place strong trust in each other."
...I'm not going to let his words tempt me.
I tighten my grip on my weapon and concentrate, anticipating his attacks.

"All right. Then let us test our endurance. You can wait and see if you made the right choice."
Murderous intent disappears from Zouken.
The old magus steps back and fades away, as if melting into the darkness of the worms.


His presence is almost gone.
I glare at Zouken, who should still be in front of me.
......
............
..................
........................
.....................And after one minute...

"Huh?"
I hear wind blowing far off, and sudden pain shoots through my left hand.
My left hand is prickling.
My Command Spell is hurting as if it's bleeding.

"Saber...?"
I have a bad feeling.
I have a bad feeling.
I have a bad feeling.
The pain on my left hand.
The sound of wind has stopped.
The old magus is laughing with murderous intent that is almost visible.

"It seems she has been taken care of. You should be able to tell as a Master. That your Servant has been eliminated from this world!"


My brain stops.
My vision freezes.
Whatis this guy saying?

"Why are you shocked? Saber has died. She has been defeated by Assassin, one she took lightly as a weaker opponent. Can you not tell that simple fact?"
"What?"

What the hell is he saying?
My left hand hurts.
My left hand certainly hurts.
But my Command Spell is still there.
It's fading, but it's still there.
ThenSaber should be coming here any second now!

"Come, Saber...!"
I scream as if to erase the pain on my left hand.
I put as much magical energy as I can into my left hand.
I don't know how to use the Command Spell.
But if this can answer the Master's wish, it should bring Saber here right away

"Kuh!"
There's no response.
The Command Spell was about to activate, but suddenly stopped.

There is nothing wrong with it.
If there is a problem, it is on Saber's end

"You are doing a meaningless thing. Even a Command Spell cannot resurrect a lost Servant.
 Well, even a fool like you should understand now. Saber has been killed by my Servant."

"Don't"
"Then let us end things here. There are still uses for the daughter of Tohsaka, but you are of no more use. You can die along with Saber on my holy land."
"Talk shit, dammit!"

I run.
I charge at the enemy in front of me, as if to shake off the ominous thought and the pain on my left hand.
It's obvious that the situation is getting worse by the second.
Then I'll escape this danger while I can still move.
I'll beat that old magus before all those worms can crawl at my body!

My attack doesn't feel effective.
A diagonal slash cuts the old magus from shoulder to hip.  Scraps of flesh scatter across the temple.

"My! I see, I see. You sure are a resolute child!"
The head on the ground laughs.

", ......!"
My weapon crumbles to dust.
Damn.
He sacrificed his body just to rot the stick I strengthened...!

"It's over now. Your youthful ardor has cost you your only weapon. My, young people lack patience these days."
"......!"

I run.
I run, stepping on the worms in my way.
Death follows close on my heels.
I try to escape the waves of worms attacking me.
I ram the black wall with my shoulder...!

"I'm out...!"
Unable to stop my momentum, I fall and roll on the ground.

"Hah, ah...!"
The worms aren't coming after me.
It must be because I ran frantically, as I end up out on the other side of the compound.

"Ouch......"
I must have landed funny, as my whole body is hurt.
"So what? More importantly"

I have to find Saber as fast as I can.
I have a bad feeling.
I have to see Saber's face, to reassure myself that she's all right

"!"
The water surface rustles.
Sensing danger, I jump back.

I get my feet away from the wet mud.
"......!?"
But I'm only able to jump back for a split second.

A sharp pain.
I feel something strange on my heel and look down.

"Wha"
It's red.
My feet are missing from the heels down.

"...It must be that."
I stepped on numerous worms during my escape.
...The strengthened stick rotted just by slashing at Zouken.
Then it's natural for my feet, which stepped on those worms, to follow the same fate.

"Guh...!"
I try to crawl out of the mud using my arms.

"Hah. You were close, child. Your decision was correct, but you lacked the necessary skill."
The worm-user's voice echoes.
The muddy ground.
Since ancient times, spiders have dwelt in the damp places of the earth.

"Well, I have obtained Saber.
 Too bad. The last reason to keep you alive has disappeared."

Worms I've never seen before come scattering down.
Hundreds of poisons that bite on my skin, crawl in my flesh, and melt my bones.
I had to bear the unimaginable pain until my consciousness faded away.
...Should I use the Command Spell...?
I don't think Saber will lose to Assassin.
But this situation is too ominous.
We're fighting this ancient monster. It's too dangerous to have Saber by herself.

"Oh? You've suppressed your poorly made murderous intent. Hm, it seems you have a plan."

He laughs, mocking me.
He is looking down on me, not caring what plan I have.


...Fine, laugh all you want.
If the Command Spell can answer the Master's wish, I am ready to use them all to bring Saber here...!

"Saber"
I concentrate on my left hand while glaring at Zouken.
I have only one command.
To summon Saber to my side!

"Mm......!?"
Even if he realizes what's happening, it's too late.
Heat lights up on my left hand, the concentrated magical energy is released as I wish, and...
...The Command Spell loses its color with a slight pain.

"What?"
I want to think it's because I failed.
I want to think that I used it wrong because I don't know how to use it.

"...Phew. It seems it is over already. You surprised me. You shortened my life by ten years."
He laughs.
...I hear wind in the distance, like a death cry.

I feel a pain on my left hand.
My left hand is prickling.
My Command Spell loses its heat as if it's bleeding.

"Noway."
I have a bad feeling.
I have a bad feeling.
I have a bad feeling.
The pain on my left hand.
The sound of wind has stopped.
The old magus is laughing with murderous intent that is almost visible.

"That is the truth. You should be able to tell as a Master. That your Servant has been eliminated from this world!"


My brain stops.
My vision freezes.
Whatis this guy saying?

"Why are you shocked? Saber has died. She has been defeated by Assassin, one she took lightly as a weaker opponent. Can you not tell that simple fact?"
"What?"

What the hell is he talking about?
My left hand hurts.
My left hand certainly hurts.
But my Command Spell is still there.
It's fading, but it's still there.
ThenSaber should be coming here any second now!

"Don't"
"Then let us end things here. There are still uses for the daughter of Tohsaka, but you are of no more use. You can die along with Saber on my holy land."
"Talk shit, dammit!"

I run.
I charge at the enemy in front of me, as if to shake off the ominous thought and the pain on my left hand.
"Hah!"
I charge at Zouken and swing my weapon with full force.
I swing my weapon down onto his head.
But something obstructs me, and my whole body is flung away.

"Ahguh!"
My back slams against the wall.
I must have been hit in the stomach, as I can't breathe.
My back is numb as if scorched with fire.

I hear worms crawling about by my ear.
The worms by the wall scatter to avoid being crushed by my landing.
...Even the squirming sounds have a mocking tone.

"You've made it, Assassin. Then I shall leave the kid to you as well. This is an easy task compared to Saber, so enjoy it all you want."

Zouken disappears.
And in his place...
A white, skull mask is smiling in the darkness.

...That must be the Servant Assassin.
An assassin with a black outfit and a white mask, appropriate for Matou Zouken.


I'm going to die.
Pain on my left hand.
My numb mind.
My heart accepts the death coming in the next moment and pounds loudly.

And I accept the weapons thrown at my forehead, throat, heart, and stomach.

A flash of silver light repels the weapons.
The four daggers that tried to take my life are blocked with a sword.


There's only one person who would do such a thing.
My left hand still hurts.
The Command Spell is still there.
Then

"Saber...!"
"Fool, did he not kill Saber...!?"

I raise my head.
The one who has come to protect me from the white-masked Servant is...
"What...?"
"Mm...?"
...A Servant dressed in black, just like Assassin.

"Ri... der...?"

There's no doubt about it.
This is Shinji's Servant, Rider.
Why is she here, and why did she save me?

"Are you going to oppose me...!? I don't care, Assassin! Kill her too if she's to get in our way!"
The skull answers Zouken's screamed command.

The long hair flutters.
Rider silently turns to Assassin and...
...She confronts the daggers that are fired like rain.

They move too quickly for mere human eyes to follow.

The masked figure leaps about the temple.
He jumps from the wall to the ceiling, then from the ceiling to the floor, hurling daggers from each position.
Coming from all directions, the daggers can neither be blocked nor avoided.

The relentless onslaught carpets the floor in knives within seconds.
Rider can't manage this.
I know how strong she is from the battle with Saber.
Assassin's attack is something even Saber would have trouble blocking.
It's natural for Rider, who was defeated by Saber in one blow, not to be able to cope with the attack.

The white skull mercilessly fires his weapons.
It...
...Looks like an attack containing irritation.

"Wha"
I realize the abnormality after the superiority is made clear.
...They have not hit her.
Not a single one of the daggers has struck its target.

"You"
A voice comes from overhead.
Apparently out of knives, Assassin looks down at his enemy with undisguised loathing.
There...

Exists one giant serpent.


...I can't believe it.
So many.
Rider evaded the countless daggers with pure speed.

It's different from when she saved me.
Rider avoided all the daggers while crawling on the ground, as if saying there was no need to repel them.

"What are you playing around for, Assassin...!? You don't need to go easy just because she is my grandson's Servant! Finish her...!"
"I cannot do thatshe is different from before."

Assassin stares at Rider while clinging to the ceiling.
Rider is different from before.
Her magical energy and coercion is on a whole new level.
Even if she's still not as strong as Sabershe certainly is stronger than Assassin.

"Kuhwhy?"

Rider doesn't answer.
But her body sinks even lower.

The instant I realize her movement is a gesture to aim at her prey...

...Rider jumps up to the ceiling, and Assassin jumps down to the floor, their blades clashing in midair.

"Kii!"

They land facing away from each other.
Rider is unwounded.
In contrast, Rider's dagger is piercing Assassin's shoulder.

"KuhI can't pull it out!?"
Assassin tries to pull out the dagger in his shoulder.


Then.
With a clinking of chain links...

"WWhaaaaaat!?"
...Rider hurls Assassin through the air...!

"Gah, giii!"
The skull mask lets out a scream of anguish.
Not saying a word, Rider continues to mercilessly swing Assassin about the room.

It's just like a flail.
Unable to do anything, Assassin is smashed against every surface in the room, his limbs bending in all directions.

"Whoa...!"
I duck to avoid Assassin coming around with a whirlwind.

"Gah, kaga, gah!"
This isn't on a level of being strong.
After flailing Assassin to her content, she uses the centrifugal force and lets go.

It's a hammer throw.

Assassin, his bones broken, is thrown at a wall head-first.

"...Oh."
...He flies away.
Like a piece of lifeless trash, the masked Servant bounces through the compound, out the gate, and down the stairs, leaving a trail of blood behind him.

"Oh... wow..."
...How brutal.
I'm sure Servants aren't so weak as to die from that, but he should be unable to continue fighting, at the very least.

"Fool"
Zouken's presence disappears.
The old magus must think he is at a disadvantage, since he flees after snarling a curse at Rider.
The worms that were squirming in the corner disappear, following their master.
...It's morning.
It's past seven o'clock.
Pure white sunlight shines in through the window.

"Mmall right."
I sit up and stretch.
I feel great.
My limbs move fine, and I don't have a headache.
My body is in perfect condition, as if the fever yesterday never happened.

"...Then that must mean it was just heartburn."
I sigh and think it over.
...I need more training if I'm losing consciousness just by recalling the events ten years ago.
My memory is vague, but I do remember Saber helping me walk home and putting me to sleep.

"I see. I have to go thank her."
I get out of my futon and change into my uniform.

I bet she's still sleeping, so I'll thank her during breakfast.
It's seven o'clock already, so I'll go greet Sakura in the living room.

"S-Senpai."
Sakura has her bag.
Breakfast is ready as well.
The table is wiped clean, ready for us to eat at any time.

"Huh? Breakfast's already prepared?"
"Oh, yes. I made some for you and Saber-san, since I had the time."

"...? For me and Saber? What about you?"
"Oh... um, I'm fine. I'm going to school, so please have breakfast with just the two of you."

"......"
 What's wrong, Sakura? It's weird for you not to eat when you've made some for us. ...Did something happen yesterday?"

...It seems like I guessed right.
But nothing happened yesterday.
Sakura went to her room after dinner, and that's all.
I think something happened after that, but I don't remember too well because of my nausea.

"...Oh. I think you and Saber were talking here. I didn't hear it too well, but did something happen then?"

"...I said something awful. I got angry because of the terrible condition you were in."
"You said something awful to Saber...?"

"...Yes. But I was in no position to tell her such a thing. But I treated Saber-san as if she was the only one at fault.
 ...I can't face her today, so..."
That's why she made breakfast and wants to leave before Saber wakes up?

"...I'm sorry, Senpai. I realized my foolishness right away and apologized to her. But Saber-san apologized to me instead. Even though I'm at fault, she said it's because of her carelessness."

She hangs her head.
...I see.
She must feel more self-hatred because Saber apologized to her when she should be the one apologizing.

"...Man, you two are stupid. It's my fault since I'm the one who got hurt. You two shouldn't have fought over such a thing."
"But, Senpai, I..."

"It's fine. Look, she doesn't give in if the other person is at fault. She'll yell back at you if you're being unreasonable. If she's apologizing, it means she sees your point.
 I'm sure Saber won't say it, but she likes you. She cares for anyone that tries hard."

"Yes. But I should reserve myself all the more.
 Since Saber-san didn't scold me, I have to scold myself or I'll get carried away."
Sakura bows to hide her embarrassment.
It seems she's going to school early no matter what.

"...Man. I won't stop you if you say so, but what are you going to do at school so early? Morning practice is suspended right now."

"It's fine. I'm going to clean the dojo. I said such an awful thing to Saber-san, so I'm going to scrub the floor as punishment."
Sakura leaves with a goodbye.

"Cleaning the dojo? But that's pretty hard on you to scrub the floor during wintertime."
...Well, I suppose that's the point.
What did she say to Saber to make her go so far?
"What? A quarrel between Sakura and me?"
"Huh? Didn't you two argue? Sakura was apologizing."

"...Now that you mention it, it may have seemed that way. But Sakura was correct, and she merely pointed out my lack of consideration..."


Wow.
Saber is deep in thought.
Not only that, she's pondering so much that she's eating at incredible speed.

"Oh, I'm sorry if I said something weird. Sakura seemed so worried about it that I ended up worried too.  If it's not a big deal, just forget about it."

"...Geez. You and Sakura are saying the same thing. Do not tell me you two are playing a prank on me."
"Hey, we wouldn't play such an elaborate prank on you! What good would that be for us?"
I don't even want to think of what'd happen if I did play a joke on her and she found out about it.

"That is true. Then you must simply have been concerned for each other."
Nodding to herself, Saber digs into another omelet.
It's good to be able to eat a lot in the morning.

"But what did Sakura say? It takes a lot to get her that depressed. Is it all right if I ask?"
"U-Um. She merely pointed out my inadequacy as a Servant. In short, she told me I could not protect you because I did not have the skill."

"...You're doing more than I can ask.
 What happened last night was my own fault. You can't blame yourself for it."

"That is true, but... Sakura's criticism is correct. The problem is me, because I cannot assent.
 I will continue taking you into battle, no matter what she tells me."

She looks away awkwardly.
"...?"
Something is strange.
Why is Saber so preoccupied with something that they've agreed on?

"...The residents grew suspicious and requested that the area be investigated"

The news is on.
I turned on the TV and found it broadcasting about an incident last night.

"...They found over thirty unconscious people, who were immediately taken to the hospital.
 This is the seventh such incident this month, and the medical examination still believes the cause to be similar to food poisoning"

I finish breakfast and get ready for school.
I'm going to go see Tohsaka.
I have to talk to her about what happened last nightabout Matou Zouken and that black shadow.

"...As the incident has spread to South Miyama 4th Avenue, the police believe the cause may be a spreading chemical spill"

South Miyama 4th Avenue.
That's the direction Tohsaka was staring at yesterday.
...Archer said the shadow is the cause of the incidents.

...Over thirty people are in comas.
I've experienced what they're going through firsthand.
That shadow is sucking magical energy from the people in this town, just like Caster.


No, it's worse than that.
Caster was gentle and considerate compared to that thing.
Caster took care not to harm her victims, so that she could continue to drain them.
It's like collecting blood with a syringe.

...But that thing is different.
That thing was not collecting blood like Caster. That thing was "eating".
The black shadow was mercilessly feeding on magical energy along with people's minds.

"Saber. I want to talk to you before I go to school."
"What is it, Shirou?"

Saber is watching the news as well.
Saber quietly questions me like always, even though she should know what I want to talk about.

"It's about our future plan of action. You saw that thing too, right?"
"Yes. I have never seen its like, not resembling any of the fantasy race."

"...Right. I don't know what that thing is.
 But it's our enemy. It didn't look like a Master or a Servant, but it attacked me and Tohsaka, and now it's sucking magical energy out of the people in town.
 Then"

"...So our current priority is searching for that shadow?
 We are to fight something that is neither a Master nor a Servant?"

Saber's stare is painful.
...Her goal is to obtain the Holy Grail.
But I'm asking her to get involved in something completely unrelated.
It's natural for her to protest.
But still

"Yes. I can't ignore that shadow. I think this is more important than the Holy Grail War."

Saber silently stares at me.
And when I start to think I can't bear it any longer...

"...Geez. I knew this was going to happen. I do not want to concern myself with that shadow, but..."
"Eh, Saber...? Um, is it all right...?"

"My opinion does not matter, because you will try to do something by yourself even if I refuse.
 I will be putting the cart before the horse. I cannot stay in this world if you die.
 I can only obey, even if I am against your proposal."

"Uh, you're right, but..."
"And I do not know how many more times you will be reckless if I leave you by yourself. It was the second time last night, so the third will certainly happen. I will have to apologize to Sakura again if that happens."

"Then..."
"I am very reluctant, but Servants obey their Masters. I will lend you my sword if that is your decision."

"Saber."
"But Shirou, that shadow is no ordinary opponent. It would be easier to fight Berserker than it."

"Ugh... Yeah, I felt that too.
 It's not a matter of it being strong or not. That thing is just ominous. I don't think we can beat it merely by striking it."

"If you understand, then there is nothing else to say.
 ...But Shirou. To oppose that thing is to go down the most difficult path. Please keep that in mind."

"......? Well, of course I'll be careful. But why are you saying such a thing? Do you know what that shadow is, like Archer does?"

"...No.  Like you, I know nothing about it."

Saber looks away.
And Saber says...

"I vaguely feel that it is the ill star itself. It is like an inescapable curse that destroys everything."
...As if to express her ominous premonition.
"Let's start homeroom.
 Go ahead, day duty... Wait, Aikawa-kun's absent, and Aimono-san's absent too? All right, I guess I'll go ahead. Stand up, every one."

...Homeroom starts.
There are more absent people, giving the room a listless feel.
Well, I think the whole school is probably like this.
Fuji-Nee lightly continues homeroom, but I don't see her usual spirit either.

"So, you can't have any club practices after school.
 That's all I have to tell you. Oh, your first period teacher, Kuzuki-Sensei, is absent, so you have self-study. I brought you all a handout, so work on that, everyone."

Everyone unanimously cheers and starts moving their desks.
Fuji-Nee doesn't care if people work on the handout or not, so everyone's free to do anything as long as they don't go out of the classroom. But

"Shirou."
...So why is she beckoning me to come see her in the hallway in such a suspicious manner?

"What, Fuji-Nee? It's class time, you know?"
"Yeah, but I couldn't go see you this morning, right? So I got really worried and was wondering if you're all right."
"...? What is it all of a sudden? What are you uneasy about?"

"Hmm, I don't really know. I just have this hunch.
 Any time I get this hunch, you could get run over by a car or fall off a bridge. So I'm wondering if you're all right."
"Man. That's normal. If you call that dangerous, I've been in danger all my life."

"Yeah, but I'm just worried.
 It feels like there's a train we have to get on together, but you're still at the platform and I'm waving goodbye to you."
"Hmm. That's pretty concrete... So you woke up after that?"

"Oh, you can tell? I woke up late because of that."
"......"

I'm speechless.
So she didn't come to my house because she just woke up late?
...Well, I'll forgive her, since that's what I expect from Fuji-Nee.

"Don't worry, I'm like always. You've got dark circles under your eyes, Fuji-Nee. You need more sleep."

"Huh? ...Well, yeah. It was busy yesterday, and it looks like it'll be busy today as well. I don't think I'll be able to go over to your place, since I'll be working overtime for a while. Much as I hate to say it, you don't have to make meals for me."

"What...?"
"That's all. Go and work on the handout. You're not doing too well in social studies, so you might fail if you don't go study hard."

Fuji-Nee cheerfully waves goodbye and leaves.

"...I don't have to cook for her? Well, that makes it easier, but..."
It's disappointing as well.
I feel empty as if my normal everyday life has disappeared.
"Yeah. I agree with you.
 I can't ignore that shadow either. I don't know the magus behind it, but I can't let him run freely on my land."

"Then can we still keep our peace?"
"Of course. We don't have much of an option until we eliminate the shadow."

Our conversation ends really quickly.
I went to Tohsaka's classroom, class 2-A, during lunchtime to go get her.
I told her I want to do something about that "black shadow", and her answer was simple.

"What do you want to do? Should we patrol together starting tonight or do things separately?"

"Let's see... I agree, we should divide the workload.
 You can keep doing your nightly patrols. Investigate any place that you or Saber think is strange.
 And I'll go after Zouken while you move around in the open."

"...Matou Zouken? Does he have something to do with the shadow?"

"Who knows? It doesn't seem likely, since Zouken was more terrified than any of us, but something's bugging me.
 ...Well, we can't let him be, regardless. He's acting suspicious, controlling Caster's corpse and making a non-magus like Shinji into a Master."

"I see. You're right. Come to think of it, we joined hands against Caster. So we can't ignore that old man."

"Right. Let's fight that shadow after everything else is taken care of. Even if you find it, don't fight and just investigate it. We have to prepare before we go for the kill."

"Okay, but what are you going to do? You say you're going to follow Zouken, but do you know where he is?"

"Huh...? Oh, I don't know where he is, but I'm going to go to the Matou household. My family is connected to them, so I'm more qualified."
Tohsaka states it simply.
But her plan isn't that simple.

"G-Go to the Matou household!? That means you're going into the enemy base!"
"I know. What are you so surprised about? I'm not going there to fight. I'm just going to investigate."

"Whatare you stupid!? What if Zouken ambushes you!?
 I can't let you go alone. I'll go too, so don't be so reckless!"

"Hey, you're the one being rash here.
 I told you, I know the Matou family. I know their magic, and I can tell how strong Zouken is from yesterday's battle. He's no match for me.
 That old magus is using most of his magical energy to maintain his body, so he doesn't have a direct way to attack me."

"It'd actually be convenient if he came at me head-on. And Shinji's harmless because he's not a Master anymore.
 You can leave the stale fight between magi to me. You go ahead and collect information."

"Mm."
I can't talk back if she can declare it like that.
...Archer will be with her, so I shouldn't worry that much.

"...All right. I'll leave Matou Zouken to you. Saber and I will look for the shadow."
"Yes, please do. ...And Emiya-kun. Sakura is at your house, right?"

"...? Yeah, she's staying over. What about it?"
"No, it's nothing. I'm just relieved to hear that.
 It wouldn't be good if she happened to be at the mansion when I go, right?"

"Oh, you're right. ......I'm surprised. You're really thoughtful."
"H-Hey, why are you looking so surprised? What kind of a person did you think I was?"

"Well, um..."
I thought she was like a storm, coming and going in a flash.

"...Humph. I don't care what you think of me.
 Anyway, I'm going to take care of Matou, so you stay quiet in your house until nightfall."

"All right. I'll leave it to you and go train with Saber. There's still some time until the sun sets."
I get up and head to the door.
Lunch break is almost over, so I should go back soon.

"Bye, Tohsaka. Let's meet here again tomorrow."
"Yes. Let's exchange what we've learned.
 Oh, but Emiya-kun."
Tohsaka grins.


...It's bad when she smiles like that.

I get this bad feeling and hurry to the door, but...
"I don't know about training.
 Isn't there something else you could do with your free time?
 Like caring for the girl living under your own roof?"
...I'm within her range.

"W-What are you saying, you idiot...!!
 S-Sakura's nothing like that, and I'm just having her stay over while Shinji's in a bad mood"

"Oh.  I meant you should let Saber get some rest. That's unexpected. Sakura's the first one to come to your mind when I mention the word 'girl'?"
She grins.

"Ah, um, ugh"
I can feel my face burning.
I feel like my brain is boiling.  I half-expect steam to come shooting out of my ears.

"I'm just joking. I'm just getting back at you. Did you like that?"
"......Hey now. I would doubt your sanity if you liked such a thing."

Strength escapes my body.
I feel like a marionette whose strings have been cut.

"Oh, right. That's your weak spot. I guess it was an ill-natured joke."
"Heh, you're the one that's ill-natured. I'm going ahead!"

"Yes, please go right ahead. I'll stay and laugh for a bit longer."
"......! Damn, see you tomorrow, Tohsaka!"

I stalk back into the building, slamming the door behind me.
...Damn.
Tohsaka's starting to have fun by mocking me.

What does she mean by me "liking it"?
First of all...
What have I done to deserve this kind of treatment?
And the girlTohsaka Rin reaches her destination.
The Matou household.
The workshop of the old family of magi who came to this town two hundred years ago.
Even though her family gave them land as a cooperator, the Matou family are outsiders they never concerned themselves with.
The two families formed a non-aggression pact, and bound themselves to not be concerned with each other's affairs.


She walks on, uncaring.
If there was a pact forbidding the two families to associate, it was broken eleven years ago.
It was originally formed by the heads of the two families.
They had abided by it for two hundred years, though its purpose had been forgotten.

Neither Tohsaka nor Matou have obtained the Holy Grail during that time.
Their pact was made to obtain the Holy Grail.
But since their wish never came true, there is no reason to follow such an ancient pact now.

She strides through the front door without ringing the doorbell.
She did not come here as a guest.
She is here as a Master, to eliminate one of her competitors in this game.

"Well, that's true, but..."
Rin searches through the Matou household with a sour expression.
...The Holy Grail War provided her with the reason to come here.
Therefore, she is not bound by the pact between their families.
Even though she persuades herself, she cannot change her personality.

"...I see. This is the first time I've gone against my dad's instruction."
She mutters to herself.
But it's nothing special.
It's not like something important was destroyed by disobeying her father.

If she regrets anything...
"...How stupid of me. I should've came here earlier if I was going to break the pact anyway."
...It's the remorse towards someone who has endured it for over ten years.

"Rin. It's about the layout of the house. There are two blank areas."
"Huh? Where is that? Is it on the first floor?"
"The second. It's a bit small to be a stairway, but it probably goes down to the basement."
"...Okay. By the way, have you noticed it, Archer?"
"Of course. But it shouldn't be harmful. If you choose to ignore it, I will as well. Our target is that monster."
She nods to his words and goes to the second floor.

Even though the red knight is not visible, he is by her side.
She brought him in case of combat, but it seems he takes notice of small details.
After traversing the house once, he has come up with a blueprint and can point out where the empty spaces are.
Rin has come to realize that Archer is skilled in analyzing the design and structure of objects.

"...I've been thinking. That strong point of yours isn't suited for an archer."
"You can whine later. Here, I got it open. It's dark, so watch"
They stop talking.
From the opening in the wall...
Damp air flows out of the pathway to the basement.
The rotten smell is unbearable even for Archer, who has not taken form.

They come down to a damp, stone paving.
Murky greenish darkness engulfs them.
The numerous holes must be to bury dead people.
In these stone chambers, the corpses decompose and fade away, leaving the holes empty to await their next occupant.

It is like the process of burial above ground.
The only difference is the process of decomposition.
It is not the soil that decomposes the corpse here, but the writhing mass of worms.

"This is the training ground of the Matouthe Makiri"
She gets dizzy.
It's not because of disgust or chill.
It is anger that causes her to shudder, repent, and vomit.
This is the training ground.
A place like this is used as a training ground.
This space containing rotten moisture, the smell of corpses, and infinite worms is the "room" given to the successor of the Matou family.

"!"
What can one learn in such a place?
The only thing here is breeding stock.
Worms to breed. Worms to raise. Worms to train.
The people of Matou have trained, urged, and bred their successor with these worms

How different is this world from her own?

The cold-hearted ways, the difficulty of the tasks, and the pain of the engraved Magic Circuit.
She's not comparing the severity as the successor.
If one is to talk about the burdened sufferings and the harshness, hers is incomparable.
She overcame more difficulties and hardships than anyone.
That is why she is a genius magus and an Average One, the user of the five elements, that the Magic Association is accepting as a scholarship student.

If one orders her to command the worms in this room, she will be able to create a superior spell in half a year.
Rin can create a spell that the successor of the Matou family has been unable to create even after ten years.

Butthis method of learning is madness.
If asked whether she could withstand being violated by these worms, she can only hesitate.

The inheritance of the magic here is not a study, but a torture.
A magic that is taught not to the mind, but to the body.
That is how the Makiris pass on their magic, and this is the preference of the old magus, Matou Zouken.
Therefore...
To be chosen as the successor of the Matou family means to be tortured forever

"Rin."
"...I know. Zouken isn't here. He either ran away or has another secret base. ...Either way, there aren't any clues here, so we should get going."
She leaves the stone room, suppressing her urge to scream.

Her footsteps fade.
...After that.
The worms swarm around what she has vomited out.

She returns to the ground floor.
Her business finished, she makes for the door, and
"Shinji. You're there, aren't you? It's no use hiding."
She calls out to the person hiding in the other secret pathway.

"! Tohsaka, you..."
"...Hmph. I was going to ignore you and go home, but I've changed my mind. Let's talk for a bit, Matou-kun."
"!"
Matou Shinji glares at Rin, but follows her request.

...He is obviously afraid of her.
His fear is not because of facing a Master and her Servant, but rather because of the threatening attitude she's taking.

"D-Don't kid me. I have nothing to talk about. First of all, the Tohsaka family shouldn't associate with the Matou family. Why are you here?"
"Oh? We both go to the same school. I don't think it's strange for me to come over."

"Hah, don't make me laugh. You break the lock, search through my house, and then call it 'coming over'? ...Heh, so I guess it's true that you lost your manners after your dad died. What a pack of morons. Since when did the Tohsaka family start acting like burglars?"

"Is that how I looked? ...Hmm, that's not such a bad idea.
 There's nothing here worth stealing, but burglars do more than that, don't they?
 They go into violent rages when they're found.
 Yes, I do want to act like a burglar right now."
She's joking.
But she isn't smiling at all.
Tohsaka Rin is coldly staring at Matou Shinji, who has his back to the wall.

"......! Y-You idiot, you're wrong! I have nothing to do with Zouken! I didn't know what that old bastard was doing until now...!"
"Yeah? So why did you become a Master?"
"...! That's because"

A gritting sound.
Even though he is cornered by Tohsaka, he swallows his words.
He was willing to tell her anything she wanted to know about the old man.
This girl is dangerous right now. There's no telling what she will do if he keeps quiet.
In the worst case...
She might simply kill him out of rage.

"Because?"
"Because..."
But he can't say it.
Telling her why he became a Master is like asking for death.

Even if...

"Then I'll say it for you. You just wanted to act like a magus. You're a failure and can't be a magus, so you wanted the Holy Grail to make you one.
 You have no other goal. You're a coward that wanted proof to hide your powerlessness."

...It's something trivial for others.

"......! Tohsaka, you...!"
"Am I wrong? You didn't have a Magic Circuit even though you were born to the Matou family. But that's not your fault. The Matou blood was fading away anyway. The duty of the Matou family as the seeker was fading away from the time you people came here.
 But you persisted.
 You thought it was special to be special, and you demanded something you didn't need. You can't be a magus even if you obtained a Magic Circuit like that, but you clung to the special right that should've been given to you."

"D-Don't talk like you know everything...! Don't talk bullshit! I can't be a magus...!? How do you know that!?"
"I can tell. I can say with certainty that you will never be a magus, even if you obtain the Holy Grail.
 You just don't have the talent. That's the difference between you and Emiya-kun."

"What...?"
His jaw drops.
That name is unexpected for Matou Shinji.
It's fine if Tohsaka Rin opposes him as a Master. He expected that.

But it cannot be possible for Emiya Shirou's name to come from her lips.
He is just an amateur.
He isn't from a family of magi, nor is he suited to be a Master.
It's too much for him to have Saber, so why is his name coming out of Tohsaka Rin's mouth!?

"HaHah. What? Stop that, Tohsaka. Why are you talking about Emiya!?"
"Because he's stronger than you. And he has the right qualities to be a magus. Emiya Shirou has something Matou Shinji does not.
 ...Yes, he doesn't have the talent, just like you. But he has the quality to be a magus. He is the best at it, and it's something he won't lose in."

"He's the best!? Him!? Hah, don't make me laugh, Tohsaka...!
 There's nothing he has that I don't have! He's the one who's got nothing! He's just a lucky bastard that made a contract with Saber...!"

Shinji's hatred for Shirou must have blown his fears away, as he now faces Rin straight on.
The girl sighs and shrugs her shoulders.

"......I see. I guess you really are beyond help if you don't understand after all this. I thought I'd hold you responsible, but you're not even worth it. I'll let you go, so go run to the church before Emiya-kun beats you."

She turns her back on him.
Telling him she has no business here.
She heads for the door, not even bothering to treat Shinji as an enemy.

"II'm inferior to Emiya...?"
His voice burns with hatred.
But he can do nothing but watch her go.
He'll surely be killed if he attacks her here.
Even Matou Shinji can see the difference in their powers.

"Tohsakayou, you......!"
A voice filled with deep resentment.
"Geez, I guess it can't be helped."
She stops, and says goodbye to the boy that used to be the successor.

"Fine, this is the end, so I'll tell you.
 Those who aim farther for others' sake. Those who think of others before themselves. ...And those who hate themselves more than anyone.
 These are the qualities of a magus. There is a place you can't reach, no matter how much talent you have.
 ...Humph. I never thought anyone would meet this condition. This is a contradiction you can only have if you're born broken."

"Shinji. You're a good example of someone who nurtures a needless inferiority complex by despising others. You love yourself so much that you believe everyone else is below you, even when they are superior in every way.
 ...You're empty inside. The only one who thinks you're full is you, and you're just like a balloon. Your destination changes depending on the wind."
"Uhguh."

"Do you understand? One such as you is unfit to be a magus.   A Servant would never obey such a person.
 This world is unrelated to you. No matter how much you consider yourself to be a Master, you can never be a Master."

The sound of retreating footsteps.
Tohsaka Rin leaves Matou Shinji alone in the dark room.

"Ha. Haha, hahaha."
He drops down the wall.
Matou Shinji crumples down like a puppet with its strings cut and keeps laughing.

"I see. So that's how it is?"
His tongue licks over dry lips.
A dull sound.
The boy smacks his head hard against the wall behind him, as if trying to break his skull.
"In short...
 He just has to disappear, right, Tohsaka?"
His laughter continues.
"All right, Sakura. Rock, paper..."
"Scissors!"

I stick out a clenched fist.
Sakura extends an open palm.
I have rock, and Sakura has paper.

"Ugh."
"All right, I won!"
I look at my fist.
...I did it again. Why do I always use rock as my first move?

"Then I'll be cooking dinner. Please relax and watch TV or something, Senpai."
Sakura skips off to the kitchen.  She must be happy that she gets to make dinner all by herself.

"...Man, I guess it can't be helped. I promised whoever wins gets to cook dinner."
I take off my apron and sit down.
I don't know about other people, but cooking dinner seems like a favorite pastime for us.

...It's not really true for me, but Sakura always wants to cook by herself.
That's good in a way, but as her Senpai, I can't let her do all the work.
So when we're both bored, like today, we fight over who gets to cook.

"...I have nothing to do, so I'll just drink tea."
I brew some tea and sit at the table.
Saber is sleeping in my room, and Fuji-Nee won't be coming since she's working overtime.
Sakura and I are the only ones here.


...Am I watching her because I have nothing to do?
Sakura is moving briskly about the kitchen, and she looks like she's having fun.

Her familiar hair and her crimson ribbon.
She handles the plates. She holds the heavy kitchen knife and places the cabbage on the cutting board.

"Hm!"
She cuts it with a yell.
Sakura tenses up every times she starts to cut something, but she keeps cooking like she's used to it after that.


I watch it absent-mindedly.
The evening living room.
A daily life here with Sakura, where time passes slowly.

I suddenly realize how hard this life is to obtain.
...It must be because I'll be going to battle at night.
I finally realize how important this time is for me.

"...Yeah. I have to protect Sakura."
I don't know what Matou Zouken is planning, but I won't let him touch her.
I've come in contact with Sakura too many times the past few days, causing me to be bewildered about her change.

...I thought I was confused by her femininity.
But that's wrong.
If I'm confused, it started long before that.

I hear her humming in the kitchen.

...These simple, trivial things are important to me.
I pour myself a third cup of tea and watch the red-tinted scenery.
Maybe there's some alcohol in the tea, because the passing time feels slow and tender.
We climb over the "no trespassing" fence into the temple.
The Ryudou Temple is now treated as important material evidence in the coma incident, and no one is allowed to enter.

"......"
The night air is not any different.
It's warm, and it smells like ripe fruit.

"...Let's go in, Saber."
"Yes. ...Please be careful, Shirou."
"I know. Tell me right away if you feel anything dangerous."

...We go through the compound and climb up to the entryway.
The wooden hallway is dark, and the floor creaks with each step.

"...Nothing seems strange. How about you, Saber?"
"...It is the same for me. But I am sure this area is abnormal. We are surrounded by a different common sense ever since we came on this mountain.
 ...It is abnormal because this mountain is filled with magical energy and we do not find it abnormal."

"...You're right. Okay, let's investigate a bit more. This temple has a lake behind it. There are more buildings over there."

...It is said that a dragon lives in that lake.
There may be a clue at the place people consider holy.

We go out into the hallway and head behind the temple.
At that instant...
"Shirou!"

"Saber...!?"
I'm shoved back into the temple by Saber.
I realize Saber has pushed me, try to go back out into the hallway, and...

The exit is shut firmly by Saber.

"Saber!? Hey, what are you doing, you idiot...!"
I bang on the door.
I don't know what kind of magic it is, but the door is as hard as steel.

"Hey, what are you doing!? Open the door, Saber...!"
The door refuses to budge, even when I throw my weight against it.

And from the other side of the steel-like door...
"Please protect yourself there, Shirou...! This opponent will only target you...!"

"What!? Who's the enemy!? Is it that shadow!?"
"No! But this Servant is a natural enemy of Masters! I am sorry, but I cannot protect you if you are at the battleground.
 I have to fight Assassin one-on-one, or he will kill you first...!"

"Assassin...!?"
I didn't even sense him.
Even though the air is strange here, a Servant's presence is a different matter.
The magical energy should be apparent if a Servant takes form near us.
Even if he hid his presence, I should be able to tell, let alone Saber!

"I will finish the battle in one blow. Please do not move until then!"
Saber's presence fades.
Her footsteps are loud. She must have repelled Assassin's attacks as she charged within range.

"Damn"
I look around.
I pick up a stick that's about the size of a wooden sword and "strengthen" it immediately.

"Hurry..."
I have to make this into a sword and break open this door.
An ominous feeling, a mysterious uneasiness, fills my mind.
This place.
It feels like a fatal mistake to leave Saber by herself on this mountain, so I have to hurry and

"!?"
The lights go out.
No, there was no light to begin with.
The moonlight has been blocked off by clouds.

"!"
...I smell something.
A smell of rotten meat and sounds of bugs flying around.

"Matou Zouken."
I glare into the darkness.
"Hah. Talk about walking into a trap, young lad."
A snicker.
It's that old magus. He's hiding somewhere.

"......Saber."
I ready the strengthened weapon.
I have no fear, even with a centuries-old monster in front of me.
The only thoughts in my mind are of concern for Saber.
"Guh!"
I'm brought back to my senses by the pain from my stomach, where Assassin hit me.
...Only Rider and I are in the temple now.
I take a deep breath and try to calm down.
Then.
I realize that the only pain I feel is in my stomach and back.

"Sa"
Instinctively, I know what that means.

"Ber"
I endure the dizziness as I head out to the hallway.

"Please wait. It's dangerous to go alone."
"......You..."
There's no enmity coming from Rider.
It seems she actually came to help me.

"...Why?"
I don't care why she saved me.

More importantly

"...You're Shinji's Servant. So why did you save me?"
I want to go there quickly.
So why am I taking my time?

"My orders are not to let you die. I only obeyed my master."

...I see.
That's fine. I don't believe her, but it's good that I got an answer.
More importantlyI have to hurry and go there.

"......"

I understand right away that this is the place.

The corridor is dead silent.
The whole place is destroyed as if a storm passed by.
In it... is a small red stain on the only part of the ground that hasn't been destroyed.

I can't tell whose blood this is.
Butmy legs lose strength the instant I see it, and I crumple to my knees.


I reach out and touch it.
The blood is dry, and it doesn't stick to my fingers.
The only thing the stain tells me is that she disappeared here.

'My role is to protect you, Shirou.'


How many times did I hear that line?
Those words were a comfort and a source of worry.
...She only cared about me.
And she never said anything about protecting herself.


I scratch at the mark.
Saber fought here and fell here.
That's what happens in battle.
I knew before I made a contract with her that this would be a battle to the death.
I accepted the fact and took her hand, and she merely answered me

"Saber"
The girl who protected me, even though she was smaller than me.
When I told her I wanted to put priority on the black shadow over the Holy Grail, she simply nodded, ignoring the premonitions of her end.

...And this is the result.
I lost her, lost my rights as a Master, and am back to being just an amateur.
I am now alone, with no means of fighting
I have to carry through with what I have to do.

"Then I have to go."
I slowly rub the bloodstain one last time.
That's it.
I don't bow or thank her, and let my fingers go.

Pain assails my left hand, and it disappears.
The moment I acknowledge her death and say goodbye...
The Command Spell on my left hand disappears without trace.

...One does not lose the Command Spell just because one has lost his Servant.
It only disappears when the magus loses his right to be a Master.

"I see. So I..."
I don't know what happened here tonight.
There is only one certainty.
I lost Saber and lost my rights as a Master.

...I leave the Ryudou Temple.
My stomach and back seem to be wounded badly, but I'm not worried about the pain right now.

"I shall see you home. It is dangerous to walk alone at night, even with the enemy gone."
"...What?"
I stop unintentionally.
All of Rider's words tonight are unexpected.

"I don't get it. Is that also an order from your Master?"
"No, I have received no such command. This is my personal choice. It is a whim of mine, nothing more."

"...I see. I'll believe you in that case, but you don't have to walk me home. We're enemies, so I can't get further in debt to you."
"Enemiesso you still have the will to fight us? Even though you are not a magus and have lost your Servant?"


I don't answer her.
First of all, I never said I'm out of this war.

"OkayI understand. Then please be careful on your way home."
Her long hair flutters.
Rider heads to the mountain gate ahead of me.
Is it because she looks so defenseless?

"...Thanks."
I mutter something I forgot to tell her earlier.

"What?"
She turns around, looking surprised.
"Ugh..."
I'm embarrassed to see a reaction like that, but I have to properly thank her.

"What did you just say?"
...And she's asking me seriously, too.
It's awkward to stare at her straight on, so I avert my gaze.

"I-I said thank you. I would've died if you hadn't saved me.
 ...As you can see, I can't give anything in return right now. So I have to at least thank you."

"Please do not mind. I only obeyed my orders.
 I will kill you immediately if my master's order changes."
With those cold, emotionless words, Rider disappears through the mountain gate.

"I thought so. That's why I told her I wouldn't take any favors."

I start walking after Rider disappears.
I can think later as to why Rider saved me.
...It takes an hour to get home.
I have to shake off the lingering memory of her in that short time.
I return to my house.
It's already past one o'clock.

"Guh."
I put my hand over my mouth as I cough up blood.
My stomach still hurts from Assassin's attack. And my back still burns from hitting the wall.
I don't know how badly wounded my stomach is, but I bet my back is just scratched.
The wounds that healed so quickly before aren't healing at all.

"I see. I'm back to my old self again."
When I had my contract with Saber, wounds healed themselves.

But that's lost.
Even a slight wound could prove fatal now.

"Senpai."
Then.
When I go into the front hallway, I find Sakura waiting for me.

"......Sakura? What are you doing up so late? Did I wake you up?"

"No, I just couldn't sleep. I noticed your shoes weren't here, so I was wondering where you went."
"Oh, I was just taking a walk."

...Come to think of it, the light was on when I came home.
Then was Sakura waiting here the whole time?

"Sakura. Were you waiting at the door all this time?"
"Huh? N-No, that's not true.
 I got up to go to the bathroom, and I just happened to be by the door when you came."

"......"
She was waiting here.
It's been over three hours since Saber and I left.
Maybe Sakura noticed right away and was waiting here all this time.

"A-Anyway, do you want some tea!?
 It's a bit late, but you'll get your spirit back if you drink warm tea and relax!"


I'm surprised.
Sakura is really pushy right now.
...I must really look terrible if she's forcing herself to act this way.

"Yeah, please. I'm home. I'm sorry I went out without telling you."
I take off my shoes and go into the hallway.
I hold my aching stomach and head to the living room.

With me in front of her...
"...Yes. Welcome home, Senpai."
Sakura looks relieved.

"Ouch!"

I wince with pain, but lie on the cushion and bear it.
The disinfectant keeps stinging my back.
The sizzling sound makes it feel like I'm getting my back scorched.

"That hurts, Sakura. I think that's enough disinfectant. Just wipe the wound and put gauze on it."

"No! We have to disinfect it properly because your back is all red! And it's natural that it hurts. You came home with such a big wound, so please bear it."

"Ouch!"
...Is it because of the archery club or Fuji-Nee that she's merciless toward injured people?

"Does it hurt anywhere else, Senpai?"
"Mm...? No, I only hurt my stomach and back. Everything else is fine."

"I see. Then all that's left is to put some gauze on and tape it up."
Sakura handles the first-aid kit with practiced ease.
She looks so intent on it that I don't want to interrupt.

"Phew."
Well.
Let's explain why this is happening. It's because I threw up the tea I drank because it stung my stomach.
I didn't want Sakura to find out, but that gave it away.

I had no choice but to tell her how badly I was hurt, and now she's treating me.
Well, she wasn't that much of a devil to begin with.

"Ehyou hurt your stomach...!?"
When I showed her my stomach...
...She was blushing so badly that she couldn't treat me.

"Are you okay with this, Sakura? I can treat myself, so you don't have to push yourself. Besides, my back is even worse."
"I-It's all right! I'll do it! Please let me do it!"
She was so flustered that I half-expected her to faint when she saw the wound on my back.

"S-S-Senpai, please take off your shirt."
I didn't want to stop Sakura, since I couldn't treat my own back.
I did as I was told and let her treat me.

Still, it was so bad that she couldn't do anything for a while.
She stared at it for a few minutes and started treating me after a gulp.


That was twenty minutes ago.
It's past two o'clock now.
Sakura's careful treatment is about to end.

"Okay, it's all done now. Here's a new shirt, so please put this on."
"Huh...? It's done already? Thanks, Sakura."

"You're welcome. Thanks for your patience."
I put on the new shirt and take a deep breath.
...There's nothing to be done about my stomach, but my back feels much better.
I'll sleep face-down tonight, and hopefully it'll be better tomorrow.

"Well. Let's get some sleep. I'm sorry I kept you up so late, Sakura."
"Ehno, that's fine, but..."
Sakura hangs her head.
It seems like she wants to say something, but can't.

"Sakura? Did something happen while I was gone?"
"......No, um... Senpai, did Saber-san go home?"


I get dizzy for a second.
'Did Saber-san go home?'

When I hear the words from someone else, the reality of it finally sinks in.

"Yeah. I know it was sudden, but she went home. She's not coming back."

I endure my dizziness and answer calmly.
...It's not like it's a stupid question.
Of course she would think something happened if Saber, who was here four hours ago, is gone.
But I have to put on a strong face and act like nothing's wrong.

"Saber was talking about you before she went away. She said you should take it easy because you're the type that thinks too hard."

"...I see. I wish I could've told her goodbye, since we just made up."
I can't even nod to that.
Saber disappeared before I could even say goodbye.

...The fact makes my heart feel so heavy that I want to vomit.
A collaborator for only six days.
My partner for only six days.
How can I repay herthe one who was my sword for only six days?

"But I'm glad. Ever since she came, you've been getting injured all the time. Now everything's back to normal."
"What?"

"Isn't that right? I won't ask you what you were doing, but you were going out to help Saber-san, right?
 Now that she's gone, you're not going to be exposed to danger anymore."

"You're wrong. I'm going to keep going out at night, even though Saber's gone. ...Um, it's not that I was helping Saber.  Saber was helping me."

I stand up.
My tension is gone now that the treatment is over.
I'm getting really sleepy.

"EhSenpai?"
"Good night, Sakura.
 And while we're on the topic... I'll be leaving my house a lot more often starting tomorrow, but you can keep using this place like you've been.
 I'll come home late, like tonight, but I don't want you to worry and go to sleep. Please don't wait by the door for me like you did tonight."

"............Okay. Good night, Senpai."

I rest my body.
...I didn't feel it until now, but I'm dead tired.
Drowsiness overtakes me the moment I lay down.


But before I do so, I glare into the darkness to prepare myself.
What Saber lost against, and what I should be fighting...
I have to accept them here and now.


...It hurts just to think about it.
My body is trembling, and my mind is about to lose against anger or fear.

"What I have to fight against..."
It's that shadow.
That "thing" that attacks people without discrimination.
The black shadow that even Saber and Archer fear.

...I know with certainty, even though I didn't see it.
That is what defeated Saber.
Assassin cannot defeat Saber.
So if there is something at the temple that can defeat her, it's that shadow.


I have to beat the thing that beat Saber.
On top of that, I'll have to deal with Matou Zouken and Assassin.
Zouken said there's no more use for me now that I'm no longer a Master.
But so long as I stay in the Holy Grail War and search for the shadow, Zouken will continue to haunt me.


A shiver runs through my body.
Saber's not with me anymore.
I have no miracle that heals my wounds, and the only weapon I have is magic as a half-ass magus.
I know this is a reckless, suicidal choice.

"But I decided to fight. I said I'll become a superhero."
I lost Saber because of that.
I've walked in Kiritsugu's footsteps ever since the fire because of that.

My only option is to stop the war so such a disaster will not occur again.
...So this will be the only night that I'll tremble in fear.
When my wound heals and morning comes...
I have to act strong so the girl who disappeared can be proud of me.
The girl returns to her room.
She walks with heavy steps to her bed and sits on it.

"......Senpai. He's so badly injured, and still..."
She doesn't know what happened.
The boy looked as lifeless as a starving man, and his body was covered with wounds.
The golden-haired girl who first appeared here several days ago has not returned.
From this, she can tell something has happened that can never be undone.
The boy is hiding something, and the golden-haired girl will not return as a result.

"......"
But such things don't matter.
For her, such things are trivial.
She doesn't know what happened, but it's fine as long as the boy is safe.
For her, having Emiya Shirou come home is an unparalleled joy.

"......Wait... is it cold today...?"
She shivers and brings her hand up to her forehead.
...It's hot.
Her body is burning up, and she has to fight to remain conscious.
It must be a light cold.
She rarely gets sick, but after waiting in the hallway for nearly three hours, it's hardly a surprise.

".........Mm..."
With sluggish movements, she reaches over and turns off the light.
She lets herself fall to the bed, lacking even the energy to change clothes.

"...It's fine. This is nothing compared to what Senpai is going through"
The girl recalls what she saw a few minutes ago.
...The wounds on his back, almost as if the flesh had been grated.
...The blackening bruise on his stomach.
...His eyes, still strong and clear in spite of his condition.

"......Ah..... Mm, fu"
Her temperature rises as she remembers.
The girl pretends not to notice that it stems from the hatred she feels.

"...Who could do such a thing?"
...Yes.
She doesn't know who did it, but she can't forgive this person.
It's not temporary dislike or annoyance.
He has been wounded all this time, but he has stayed beautiful.
She cannot forgive anyone that hurts someone important to her.

"Hm... but... Senpai's back was amazing..."
She reaches out her hand in a daze.
...It's been a while since she last saw his naked skin so close.
When they first met, he was small as a boy and was about as tall as her.
But in the two years since then, he has grown into a man.

"............Hm"
Something stirs beneath the sheets.
Trapped between her body and the bed, her hand slowly creeps down between her legs.

It's different from when he collapsed from a cold.
Back then, it was a cold and nothing more.
Tonight, it was the body of a wounded man.

"Senpai."
Thinking about it causes her to space out.
He must train without a day's rest.  His body is sturdily built, without even an ounce of useless muscle.
His graceful build is like that of an antelope. It has the beauty of having inner strength, one that allows it to jump up precipices, that is not apparent.

"Yeah... His chest was broadhe was a real man."
Her outstretched fingers run across the chest that is not here.
She unconsciously runs her fingers across his body.
They run from his chest down to his stomach.
Crawling across the bedsheets, her fingers travel below her belly button and...
"Oh."
Her face turns bright red.

"S-S-S-S-Stupid me...!
 I-I'm sorry, Senpai...!"
She quickly pulls her hand back.
She even turns her ears red and curls up on the bed.
It shouldn't be this embarrassing, but her memory is too vivid.
The feel of his skin beneath her fingertips only made her imagination more concrete.

"Huh?"
But...
Is that what caused her to heat up?
"Ahmm, fuh......"
Her heart starts to beat faster.

"Mm...... Ah, ah"
It's too late to stop.
...Her body is hot.
Her mind is in a daze, and she can only think of one thing.
Her limbs are heavy, and it feels as if she has turned into a puppet.

"Hah... Hm, ah... Ah, mm... Fuh"
...Her breaths are unbelievably hot.
Is it because the heat is escaping from her body?
The heat invades her brain and melts her memory, intelligence, reason, and morals, making her think of only one thing.
"Ah, hah... Senpai... Hm..."
The heat takes over her body, and the limbs are out of her control.
But dirty desire creeps up from within her.

"Ahhaa, ah, hm!"
She doesn't stop.
She moves her fingers, which were just tracing Shirou's body, down between her legs.

"...Senpai... Senpai, Senpai, Senpai...!"
...Her fingers start to move wildly as if to match her breathing.
The wet sound slowly gets louder into something indecent.

"Ahhm... NoI... shouldn't... be doing... this"
The feeling of guilt excites her even more.
His wounded body. Thinking about the blood on his back makes her dizzy.
The girl who won't be coming back. The realization that, once again, he is all hers. Many lies.
The dark emotions, unthinkable for her usual self, draw her down into a darker passion.

"Hah, haa, ha, mm...! Sen... pai... Ah, I, Iah... Hm... no...!"
But those are trivial matters.
What she's truly glad about is that the boy has come back to her.

 "Nhaa...! Ha, haa, ah, Senpai's, fingersmoreno, having him back... is enough...!"
...But it's not enough.
Tonight made that clear.
He cares for her, but he tries to protect her by keeping her away.

"Ah, nha, hah, ah...! No, Senpai, II want, you to be, next to me...!"
She knows it's a greedy wish.
Her passion gets worse because it is a wish she should never speak of, a wish that will never come true.

"Mmuha, ah, hm...! I'm sorryI'm sorry, Senpai, I'm... sorry...!"
A heated masturbation.
The repeated repentance cools off the

 girl's temporary madness.

"...Mm... Ah...... Haa... ah"
She stares at the ceiling absent-mindedly.
The overwhelming self-hatred after the climax is familiar to her.
But a heavier agony assails her tonight.

...The wounded body.
He said he intends to continue fighting, even after receiving such wounds.

"......What should I do? Senpai's going to get hurt even more like this..."
She thinks as her body sweats.
It's a worry without an answer, a problem the girl cannot solve.
She cannot come up with a way to stop him, even if she thinks all night.
But...

"I see. I just have to keep him from going outside."
She reaches a simple answer with a calm voice.
Delighted by her sudden insight, she smiles and...
"Right. You won't get in any more danger if you're hurt so badly that you can't walk"
Whispers to herself with a sigh of relief.
It is a room that smells of stone.
The light is not artificial but natural.
The lamp's flame shines on the man's back and illuminates the parchment in his hand.

"Is that a report for the Association? You certainly are a busy man, Kotomine."
The voice comes from behind him without revealing its source.
The man on the chair, Kotomine Kirei, moves on to his next task without the slightest reaction.

"Oh, so this is about that usurper.
 Hm, 57 victims with five dead. Is this a lot from the supervisor's perspective, Kotomine?"
"I can't say much as of this moment. This is the first instance of large-scale unconsciousness, but there's no problem if it stays this way. Either association is aware of the necessary clean-up measures.
 But"
"If it continues at this pace, huh? ...Heh, I do not know who is doing this, but they're being quite brazen.
 ...Have you realized, Kotomine? If nothing is done, this town will become barren of life."

Kotomine does not answer.
He knows what the man wants to say.

The strange shadow that appeared in this town.
It's only sucking up life force right now, but the amount is increasing by day.
The abnormality that first surfaced two days ago will exceed the regulated allowances in a few days.
For the moment, it only causes dyspnea, but it should soon be enough to kill even a healthy adult male in one night.

"But that is needless worry. It should not be an amateur, so it should know its limits."
"Is that so? That worm-user does not seem like it, but such a person will become a curse if you do not take care of it quickly. It is not my style to watch people in this town die."

This statement takes Kotomine by surprise.
This man, who does not care about anyone else, is concerned for the people.

"I'm surprised. What is going on, Gilgamesh?"
"It should not be surprising. I do not like it when people are killed by someone besides me. People will lose their way with boring crime and punishment. Such pain is not entertaining at all."

"...I see. Then you are indeed a heroic spirit.
 You use death to save people from the agony of life. Then your wish is death?"
"Of course. This age is filled with meaningless, worthless people.  Exterminating them will be doing them a service."

His scorning voice is filled with absolute dominance and dignity.
The priest does not stop his work as he listens.

"I see.
 You can use the Holy Grail, if that is what you wish. It will be yours unless someone who can defeat you appears."
"Hm? You do not have a wish, Kotomine?"
"I don't have a clear wish. The only thing I have is the desire for clear pleasure."
"HaHahaha, I see, so you only have pleasure!"

The man starts laughing at the simple answer.
It's as if he's delighted and proud of his partner.

"All right. I shall kill because they are disgusting, and you shall kill because it is fun. Our motives are different, but we seek the same thing from the Holy Grail. That must be why you have kept me!"

The priest does not answer.
He merely continues his work.

"HahI do not care even if you do nothing. I shall do as I please."
The man's presence disappears.
The priest glances at the exit of the silent stone room.

"He seems insane, but he is sane at the core. It seems the mud was unable to pollute his soul."
King of heroes, Gilgamesh.
The golden Servant is the most powerful being at this point in time.
The fact is accepted as truth by all.  Even Kotomine, the game master himself, does not doubt it.
But

"There are worthless things, but there are no meaningless things.
 ...Beware, king of heroes. If there is something that will bring you defeat, it will be just that."
His monologue does not reach anyone.
Lit by the dim light, the priest resembles a prophet seeing into the future.
Continuation: Not enough love!

Ugh, the one who reformed and graduated from this dojo has been reborn as a devil child. ...Will she really be able to become a heroine?

...Well, I guess it's impossible.
Impossible. It's impossible no matter what!

I bet she's trembling outside right now, wanting to come back, but can't because of all the big talk she gave me!

Well, it's cold outside, so I bet she'll come back with a souvenir around the next dojo.

So, this bad end is also because of lack of love.

It's obvious whose love you're lacking this time, right? Try getting a bit closer with Ilya-chan so that she won't go full out on you.

The important points are whether you meet Ilya-chan on the 7th day and how you apologize to her.

You have to restart from day 5 if you can't meet her on day 7.
You have to consult Tohsaka-san if you see her at school.

That's the end of this Tiger Dojo.
Please continue enjoying Sakura-chan's route, where the atmosphere completely changes with the appearance of many new characters.
Welcome!
This is the familiar Tiger Dojo, the place that saves Shirou, who died from a simple bad choice!

This dead end is because you made the wrong decision!
I won't explain in detail, so go back to the previous choice and choose another

There, trespasser!

Ouch!

How ridiculous of you to try to take over!
What are you doing here while I was gone, pupil number one!?

Ouu... I showed up naturally, but you easily saw through it.

How dare you say that, buruma.

So, what's gotten into you?
I thought you wouldn't be coming to the dojo because you'd be busy in the main storyline.

Eh...ahaha, well, um, the power balance was not what I expected... And, see, I came back, thinking that you might be lonely by yourself.

..................And?

Ah, um... uhh...

Uwaaa, I'm selling my pride!
Please, master, I want to be your pupil again!

Okay, I refuse with all my might! Live as a homeless bum, you buruma-girl!

All right! That's why I hate you!
Then I'll do it by force! You just watch! I'm going to take over this place next time!

Hahaha, I'll take that challenge, you devil-child!
I shall wait and see what you can manage without any magic, gahahahaha!

It's lunchtime.
In accordance with our agreement, I meet up with Tohsaka on the rooftop and tell her what happened last night.
And the result is...

"Then what!?
 Matou Zouken is Assassin's Master, and he tried to kill you and not Saber!?"
...Tohsaka getting really angry.

"T-That's right. What's with you all of a sudden?"
"It's not sudden!
 From what I heard, Zouken tried to kill you after Saber was defeated. That's strange. The process is wrong no matter how you look at it!"

Tohsaka leans forward and glares at me.
I back up just a few centimeters because of her attitude, but we're sitting in our spot behind the water tower.

"Hey. Are you listening to me, Emiya-kun? Didn't you think something was strange about what you told me?"
Tohsaka Rin glares at me in dissatisfaction.

"Ugh."
...As if her attitude wasn't bad enough, now she's getting right in my face.
This space is small, so there's no room for me to back up.
I'm like a mouse in a trap. There's nowhere for me to run.

"Umm...... What was strange?"
"It's the priorities. Zouken didn't try to kill you, even though you two were alone.
 It was fortunate that Assassin was able to beat Saber, but there was also a chance of Assassin's defeat. Zouken should've tried to kill you, Saber's Master, as quickly as possible."

"...Well, that's true.
 But maybe Zouken was confident that Assassin could beat Saber."

"No way. Even you could tell that Assassin was weaker, right? Then Zouken definitely wouldn't gamble like that.
 ...I bet he had a reason not to kill you.
 Well, I can think of two reasons."

"Two...? So that's..."
"Was he on guard against my counterattack?"

"I don't think so. From what you've said, I don't think your counterattack would've been effective. And if I were Zouken, I wouldn't leave a trapped enemy enough room to counterattack.
 Setting up a trap shows that you're determined to kill your opponent.
 If you're worried that your target will attack you once he's fallen into the trap, your trap is a failure."

"I see. An opinion expected from a perfectionist, Tohsaka."
"That was just a generalization. You don't go into the cage yourself if you want to capture your opponent alive, right?"
"...Maybe he didn't want to kill me right then?"

"...Well, I guess that's the most likely motive.
 I have to assume that Zouken didn't want Saber to disappear. The only negative effect of your death would be Saber's disappearance."
"Yeah. That's all I'm good for."

"Hey, why are you sulking? I-I'm just talking about Zouken, so don't take it too seriously."
"...? I'm not sulking. It's true.  Why are you getting mad about this?"

"...! I-I'm not mad.
 You're just misunderstanding me."
"...I guess he was playing around. Maybe he thought he could kill me any time."

"...Yeah. I'm sure there's some other reason, but maybe he could afford to keep you alive as long as he wanted.
 Maybe we could take advantage of that opening..."
"Anyway. Zouken had something he wanted out of Saber.
 He probably wanted you to stay alive as a Master. But with that aside, he had a reason to kill you.
 ...I'll ask again. You're sure that he said you're useless, right?"


...I recall what happened last night.

"There are still uses for the daughter of Tohsaka.
 But you are of no more use"

"...Yeah. And he also said you're still useful."
"I see. ...I don't know why you're useless now, but that must be why he's running away from me.
 One of us has to die if we meet. But Zouken needs both of us to stay alive for some reason, so he's hiding from me"

Tohsaka ponders.
"............"

Well.
I've told her what I need to tell her.
If there's anything else I should say, it's
...No, I have nothing to say to her.
This is my problem.
I chose to keep fighting.

Matou Zouken and Assassin.
The black shadow wandering around town.
The battle between Masters over the Holy Grail.
I chose to fight to stop it, and sacrificed Saber.
...Then I can't sacrifice anyone else.
I have to fight by myself from now on.

"Emiya-kun...? Why are you so quiet?
 Is there something you haven't told me yet?"

"No, that's all. I lost Saber, and I'm not a Master anymore. There's no reason for me to fight you anymore."

"Yeah. If you're out of the Holy Grail War, both our truce and our promise to eventually fight are nullified. So, Emiya-kun..."
"Yeah. I'm out of the war. An amateur like me has no chance of winning without Saber's help."

I stand up.
Leaving Tohsaka behind me, I head for the door.

"Bye, Tohsaka. Watch out for Zouken."
"Hey, Emiya-kun"
I open the door without turning around.
I leave the rooftop as if to cut off my regret.

The day ends.
I have to wait until night even if I am to go after the shadow and Zouken.
As I am much weaker, I will need useful information and a weapon.
...I'll wait until night, sneak into the Ryudou Temple, and try to obtain some information.

"I have to look after Sakura, too. I'll wait until night for now."
Battles can wait.
I want to concentrate on nursing Sakura until then.
...I have some time, so I'll go to the shopping district and buy a few day's worth of groceries.

"I'm home."
I call out as I go into my house.

"?"
...Then.
I feel something strange as soon as I enter.

"Footprints...?"
I see something like footprints on the floor.
It's a trace of someone coming in with shoes on, and the house is free of any human presence.
The only shoes I see are Sakura's, and it seems the housekeeper I asked for has gone home.

"Sakura."
I go into the guest room.
It's empty.
The strange feeling turns into an ominous conviction.

I return to the living room.
Sakura isn't here either.
The footprints end here in the living room.
Whoever the intruder was, he came in, did something here, and went back outside.

"...There's blood."
There's a small trace of blood on the floor, as if someone coughed up blood here.
I get an intuition.
Sakura was here a while ago.
Sakura was in the living room, waiting for my return.

Traces of an intruder.  Traces of blood.
The absence of Sakura, who should be sleeping sick.

That's all.
It's more strange not to draw a conclusion.
The answer is clear if I think about it just a bit.
Calmly.
Calmly.
Calmly.
Calmly think, and I can tell what happened here.

So, why

Why is my head not working at all?

I should've come home earlier.
I should've thought about it more seriously.
Didn't I have Sakura stay over for fear that something like this would happen?

Matou Zouken said Sakura is unrelated.
Why did I believe his words?
There's no way she's unrelated when she's part of the Matou family.

So why?
Why did I believe such a convenient story!?


The phone rings.
My head blank, I pick up the phone with mechanical movements.

"Hello? Are you finally home, Emiya?"

The cheerful voice is that of Matou Shinji.

"What did you do with Sakura?"
"Huh? Oh, I called you because I thought you'd be sad about Sakura not being there, but it seems you're more perceptive than that. That's amazing. You know what's going on before I've told you anything."

"Shut up. What did you do to Sakura?"
"Huh? I only took back what's mine. I can't leave her at someone else's house forever."

"Shinji."
"Haha! That's great, you're getting pissed! You're vexed that I took Sakura!"

Vexed...?
No way. I don't have such extra emotion.

"Don't waste my time. Just tell me what your business is."
"Hehyou should know. Let's decide our match. You don't think that previous fight was the end, right?"

"I do. You ran away. Everything was decided right then."

"It's not decided...! That's the difference in our Servants, not your power! I wouldn't have run away if Saber wasn't there! There's no way I'll lose if Saber doesn't come...!"

If Saber doesn't come...?
...I see. Rider must not have told Shinji that Saber was eliminated.
I don't know what Rider is thinking, but Shinji still thinks I'm a Master.
Ohthat must be why he kidnapped Sakura.
In short, this phone call is to...

"Shinji. What are you going to do with Sakura?"
"Nothing. But that would depend on what you do.
 I won't do anything to Sakura if you come alone. You know what that means, right?"

"Yeah. You want me to fight you without Saber, right?"

"Wow, you're pretty bright today. Look, we'll fight at school. I'll give Sakura back to you if you come alone.
 ...Oh, but don't try to pull any shit with me. Rider set up a boundary field over the school. I'll know right away if you bring Saber along.
 If that happensI can't guarantee what'll happen to her."

"Ow...!"
I hear a sound of him kicking something.

"I'll go right away. Don't do anything else to Sakura."
"Hah...! Fine, I'll take that exchange.
 But still, didn't you take your time coming home?
 You say not to do anything else to Sakura, but even I can't think of any other things to do to her that I haven't already tried."

"What did you do to Sakura, Shinji?"
"Who knows? I got bored with punching her, so I gave her to Rider. It's just like that night. Rider bit Sakura's neck and"

I smack down the receiver.
"You did it, Shinji."
I can still hear his laugh.
I set off for school, my nerves blazing with anger.

I go outside.
The sky is dark, and the sun's about to set.
I bet it'll rain tonight.
I have to come home with Sakura before that.

The school building is deserted.
Thanks to the series of comas, the school closed early.
It's past five o'clock, and there are no students or teachers at the school now.

There's hot steel in my back.
The Magic Circuit is already made.
I concentrate so that I can use my only weapon whenever necessary.

It must be Rider's boundary field.
The school's tinted red, and my lungs are damaged every time I breathe.
I cough up blood.
But I ignore it and run up the stairs.

I'm not certain, but I can still guess.
Considering Shinji, he wouldn't position himself on unfamiliar territory.
He has to be in the classroom on the third floor.

I get up to the third floor.
The red filter condenses, scraping off my magical energy with each step I take.

Was he waiting for me?
Shinji is watching me from the entrance of room 2-C.

"Shinji...!"
"Hahso honest, Emiya.  You came, just like you promised...!"

My brain boils up.
Sakura must be in the classroom.
I have to check if she's all right.
If Shinji would get in my way, I would mercilessly...

"It's your turn, Rider! It's the Master of the one who defeated you...! Repay him for that insult...!"
The black Servant stands in my way.
I don't care.
I can't stop, no matter who may be in front of me.

The dagger is swung.
I read its course with amazing speed and avoid it.
Having dodged the dagger, I pass by Rider next.
It must be because of her tall figure and her long hair, but Rider cannot seize me as I rush past.

Got him.
The distance is about five meters. I close in on Shinji in under two seconds, aim at the Command Spell controlling Rider, and...
".........!!!!?"
My tongue bulges from my mouth.
Something squeezes my neck from behind.

"Phew. What are you doing, Rider!? You call yourself a Servant, letting Emiya do things like this!?"
"......I am sorry. I took his concentration lightly."

I hear Rider's voice from right behind me.
"Guh... kuh, ah...!"
My feet don't reach the ground.
Rider has wrapped a chain about my neck and lifted my body off the floor.

"Hagah, guh......!"
Suspended in the air like this, I can't do anything to resist.
Rider is out of sight behind me, and my neck is already

"You lost because you lost your composure, Saber's Master.
 I cannot entrust Sakura to you. ...Though it is not my will, you must die here."
"Guh, ......"

...My consciousness fades away.
A bit more.
It's only a bit more, but my body is suspended in midair...

...And I hear the sound of my neck breaking.
I have to decide what to do from now on.

I chose to keep fighting.
Matou Zouken and Assassin.
The black shadow wandering around the town.
The battle between Masters over the Holy Grail.
I chose to stop it even without Saber.
Then it shouldn't matter how I do it.
I need Tohsaka's help if I don't want there to be any more victims.

"Tohsaka.
 I lost Saber and my Command Spell. So I'm not a Master anymore, right?"

"...Right. I forgot about that. You're not a Master anymore. You have no reason to be involved in the Holy Grail War, and you're less likely to be attacked by other Masters."

"Yeah. I only wanted the Holy Grail because Saber wanted it. ...I have no interest in it now that Saber's gone."
"I see. Then you're not going to be fighting anymore?"

There's no emotion in Tohsaka's eyes.
Her words are merely something she must ask as a Master, devoid of personal interest.


This is not a question, but a warning.
This is my last chance.
She's providing me with a chance to back out, telling me I'll still make it if I want to withdraw.

"I will fight."
But my mind is made up.
I'll remember her consideration, though.

"I will fight. I won't stop fighting just because I'm not a Master. I chose to fight to stop the war."
"I see. Then I guess we'll still keep our relationship.
 Even though we're enemies, we'll keep our truce in place until the shadow has been beaten."

"...?"
Tohsaka suddenly smiles.
She looks friendly, as if something good has happened.
Well, I don't care, but

"Hold on. Why are we enemies?
 I'm not a Master anymore. There's no reason for us to fight."

"What are you saying? Even if you've lost your Command Spell and your Servant, you're still Saber's former Master.
 You were somehow chosen by the Holy Grail, so you have the right to obtain the Holy Grail until the very end. You're still my rival even though you're powerless."

"Really? Even if I have no intention of obtaining the Holy Grail?"

"That would depend on the situation, right? It's possible that you end up needing the Holy Grail when you're in a situation where you can obtain it, and you inevitably use it.
 Unselfish people are affected by other people because they are unselfish."

"Hm. You're thinking too much, Tohsaka. Even if I end up needing the Holy Grail, that doesn't mean I can obtain it."

"It's just a what-if. But the possibility is there.
 That's why I'm saying we're enemies, and that's why magi that aren't Masters anymore run to the church.
 Even without their Servants, they're still obstacles to the other Masters. Keep that in mind and watch out. It's not just Zouken that wants to kill you."

"Hm...... I appreciate the warning, but..."
Um, I don't like having Tohsaka as an enemy.

"...? Why the difficult face? We're already enemies. Is there a problem with that?"
"Yeah. This means I can't ask for your help after all."

"Huh?"
She freezes.
She looks at me as if she's seen a ghost.

"Why do you need my help...?"

"Because I can't do this by myself. Ending the Holy Grail War means defeating the other Masters, but I don't have the power to do so."

"...I know it looks pitiful, but I don't care about that. I only have a few options, and I think this is the best thing I can do.
 That's why I can't be enemies with you.
 I need you as an ally."

"...Hey. Are you sane, Emiya-kun?"
"I am. I'm too weak to fight alongside you, so I could end up weighing you down.
 I can't offer you anything in return, so there's nothing in it for you if you help me.
 ...Yeah, cooperation like this isn't usually possible."

"H-Heh. So you do understand.
 Equivalent exchange is standard for magi, just like you say. I can't lend something to someone with no money, and I can't help someone who can't help me in return. You know that's for your own good too, right?"

"I gave you advice because we had a truce, but it's a different matter if we're actually allies.  If that were the case, we'd have to share the reward too."

"I know. But I'm asking you anyway, even knowing that.
 Please help me, Tohsaka. I'll pay you back for this as long as I'm alive."

"As long as you're alive?"
Tohsaka looks away and mutters.

...I'm fully aware that I'm only a burden on her.
But Tohsaka is the most reliable person I know, and I can trust her to do no wrong even if she obtains the Holy Grail.
So Tohsaka is the only one I can see winning, and the only one I'm willing to cooperate with.

"Tohsaka. Let me hear your answer."
I look at her straight on.
"...I-It's obvious, right? Even if I team up with someone who's not a Master, I..."

"Tohsaka."
"I said I can't help you even if you ask me like that. First of all..."

"Tohsaka."
"...This is like a real contract."

Then.
Tohsaka looks down once, and...

"Geez, all right! Then here are the terms for our agreement!"
She glares at me.

"...? What do you mean by terms?"
"Terms are terms!
 ...Um, this is a legitimate contract.
 So I'll consider it if you can promise me what I'm going to ask you."

"...??? Tohsaka. I've already told you, I have nothing I can give back to you."
"Just listen to me!"
"......! A-All right, I'll listen."

"Okay. Here's the first one. I don't mind cooperating, but will you do as I tell you?
 Will you obey me, no matter what I tell you to do, during a battle?"
"No. I probably can't obey you unconditionally."
"...Hey now. Who do you think you are, answering like that from the very first question?"
"But isn't it normal? For example, I'd be in trouble if you give me a reckless order."

"I won't be that stupid. If you think it's reckless, it's probably because you don't understand what I'm planning.
 ...Oh well. So you'll obey me, as long as the order's reasonable?"
"Yeah, I can keep that promise."
"Then here's the second question. Can you trust me like I'll be trusting you? Will you stay on my side, no matter how ugly things get?"
"Hm... I won't betray you, of course, but I'm not sure about the last part.
 What do you mean by things turning out ugly?"

"That's obvious, right? I'm talking about dying or coming close to it. You have nothing to give me, so you need to be prepared for such a thing, right?
 Or what? Are you saying I should conveniently give you whatever you ask with nothing in return?"

"Uh, guh. You've got me, Tohsaka."
"Of course. I'm not playing around right now. It's not worth it for me unless you show that much determination."
"...Okay. I'll try my best."
"I see. So you will give me your absolute obedience?"

"Mm."
Tohsaka says something dangerous with an evil smile.
That seems to be the final question, but
"No way...! I'll admit that your instructions are better as a magus. But I'm sure you make mistakes once in a while.
 If you say something ridiculous, I can't just obey you. I'll protest if I think you're wrong. That's what it means to cooperate, right?"

"Of course. I can't cooperate with you unless that's the case.
 I tend to do things my own way, so I need someone to act as my brakes.
 It'll be helpful if you can take that role."

"Huh?"
...I'm a bit disappointed.
I expected disagreeing to spark an argument, but Tohsaka is nodding in satisfaction.

"Then here's the last question.
 I'll help you as much as I can if it's something I can do and you can't do.
 But... can you do the same even in the opposite case?"

"...? Something I can do that you can't do...?"
Is there such a thing?
Is it possible that she can't cook and needs my help?

"Hey. Come on and answer since this is the most important question. Yes or no. Quick."
"...Well. Um, it'll help me out if you can give me a specific example..."

"Geez...! I'm asking if you'll let me win or not!"


She says with her cheeks blushing, as if she's sulking.
It looks childish, completely unlike Tohsaka.

But
"......Yeah.
 I'll let you win since I'm cooperating with you. I promise."
...It's actually really cute.

"Then we'll meet at the front gate after school.
 You're going to have club activities at my place, starting today."
"Hmclub activities at your place?"

"Yup. We're cooperating, so I need to teach you how to fight by yourself, right?
 ...Well, I know from what I've already seen that you're an amateur, so you'll be working overtime every day."

"Well, I don't mind, and that's actually helpful
 But is that starting today?"

"Of course. I have to figure out your ability and determine our plan from tonight on.
 You'll be going home late, but it's no problem since you live alone, right?"
"Huh? Well, that's true, but how do you know that, Tohsaka?"

"...! I-I thought so because there wasn't anyone at your house when I treated your wound before.
 A-Anyway, that's how it's going to be, so you just have to wait for me at the front gate!"


Tohsaka waves goodbye and runs off.
It's Friday today... Classes run to sixth period, so we'll be going home after three o'clock.

"...This is bad. I told Sakura I'd be coming home early, but I can't cancel Tohsaka's proposal on the very first day."
I feel bad for Sakura, but I'll go with Tohsaka for today.

...Well, she isn't a devil.
So she might let me go home early today if I tell her about Sakura.... Right?
Tohsaka's analysis ends rather quickly.
She lit an incense, did something like tarot fortune-telling, and asked me a few personality assessment-like questions.

And Tohsaka says...
"You don't correspond to anything. Further testing would be useless."
...And quickly gives up diagnosing my Magic Circuit.

"Hey. Does that mean you can't tell?"
And when I ask her...

"Excuse me. I found out that you're not related to the five elements. Any more consecration is out of my expertise, so it's useless to keep going.
 I'll just see what magic you can use and figure it out from there."

...That's how it is according to her.
I run through the "strengthening" magic using the clay she prepared.

It's called an ether cluster, and it's a strange object that returns to its original form no matter what happens to it. It's a good conductor of magical energy.
I strengthen it so easily that I'm afraid it won't recover, but...

"It's like shiniku, so don't worry about it. It restores its original state in a day even if you bundle it with strong magical energy."
...She says something like that.
Shiniku, by the way, is meat that never goes away, no matter how much of it you eat.

...Anyway, I keep repeating the strengthening magic on the clay.
I can't fail in front of Tohsaka, but I only succeed two out of ten times.
Activating my Magic Circuit, which was easy when I had Saber, took a lot of time and effort.

Tohsaka asks me a few questions while I cast the strengthening magic.
Whether I'm self-taught, whether I can use any other spells, how Kiritsugu taught me, and what I have the easiest time imagining.

So.
Tohsaka's expression darkens further with each answer I give, and by the end she's shut up entirely.
I don't know what she's angry about, but it's really awkward to be here if she makes a face like that.

"Tohsaka? ...Um, I know it's only a matter of course, but are you regretting cooperating with me because I'm such an amateur?"
I ask her the most likely thing.

"Huh...? Yeah, I do regret that you're an amateur, but in your case, you were taught wrong... Or should I say that I'm surprised you're still alive with the way you're doing things."
Tohsaka ponders.

"...? Heeey, Tohsaka? You lost me."
".........?"
Why is she glaring at me?

"......Fine. I guess if I'm going to correct you, we'll have to start with the fundamentals.  But let's go back to what we were talking about earlier. Is it true that the things you projected are still in your shed?"
"Yeah. Things don't normally go away unless you break them, right?"

I told her that I use projection as a breather in between strengthening magic.
It seems Tohsaka is particular about it, and told me to use projection using the clay.
She told me to make a vase. Everything started out smoothly, but in the end I still failed.

"Hmph. For now, I'll teach you how to turn your switch on and off.
 It's faster to make an actual switch in your body.  Stay over tonight. It's a drastic measure, so you'll have to stay in bed all night."

"What? You mean here?"
"What's with that face? Don't worry. I'm not going to be performing surgery on you. You'll just drink some medicine. Well, you won't be able to move for a while because it's so strong."

"Oh... Um, it's not that I don't like drastic measures..."
...I look at the clock.
It's almost five.
I didn't notice since it's cloudy today, but it's getting late.

Tohsaka is helping me as a fellow magus.
It makes me happy, and I'm grateful, but I'm worried about Sakura too.
I should
...I'm worried about Sakura.
I feel bad, but I should clearly tell her.

"Tohsaka? Would you mind doing that at my house?"
"Huh? At your house?"

 "Yeah. Sakura's lying sick at my house, so I want to go check on her. I won't be able to rest easy while I'm lying in bed unless I'm sure she's all right."

"Crapthat's right."
...She's astonished.
It's only natural. Anyone would get mad if someone asked to cooperate, but told them today is a bad day to train

"You idiot! I wouldn't have kept you here for so long if you'd told me earlier...!"
".........Huh?"
She stands up as soon as she yells at me, then crosses the room and puts on her coat.

"Let's go. We've done everything that has to be done here, and we can do the rest at your place. We'll continue as soon as you're done with nursing Sakura, so let's hurry."
"Eho-okay. That'll help me out."

"...Humph. I'll tell you now since I don't want to have to keep remembering this.
 Your nature is in projection and not strengthening.
 I don't know where you made your mistake or what your misunderstanding is, but you're a magus that belongs on the 'side that creates'."
Tohsaka walks off down the hallway.

"...?"
I tilt my head in wonder, but I follow Tohsaka and leave the Tohsaka household.
...Tohsaka's cooperating with me, so she takes precedence.
I'm worried about leaving Sakura alone in her condition, but today's an exception.

"...Hey, why the painful look?
 You don't mind taking drastic measures, right? Then just give up and accept it."

"...Yeah, I will. But let me make sure, Tohsaka. This thing will end today, right? I'll really be in trouble if I can't move tomorrow."

"...Well. I can't deny that possibility, to be honest. I can't tell how it'll turn out, and it'll take longer if your body has matured to the point where it can't be tampered with. And there's the possibility of the operation itself failing.
 Well, that's all up to your luck. How's your luck recently, Emiya-kun?"

...It's bad.
It's worse still given that the one asking me holds my fate in her hands.

"...Hold on. That's really troublesome.
 I have to go home by tomorrow."
"Huh? Your home?"

 "Yeah. Sakura's lying sick at my house, so I want to go check on her. I won't be able to rest properly in bed if I don't know that she's all right."

"CrapI forgot about it."
...She's astonished.
Tohsaka stares at me, bewildered, and...
"You idiot! I wouldn't have kept you here for so long if you'd told me earlier...!"
...As if trying to get back at me, she gives a bewildering reply.

"We can talk about the switch later! We can do that at your house!"
"W-What...!?"
She yells at me as she crosses the room and puts on her coat.

"Let's go. We're done with what we have to do here, and we can do the rest at your place. We'll continue as soon as you're done with nursing Sakura, so let's hurry."
"Eho-okay. That'll help me out."

"...Humph. I'll tell you now since I don't want to have to keep remembering this.
 Your nature is in projection and not strengthening.
 I don't know where you made your mistake or what your misunderstanding is, but you're a magus that belongs on the 'side that creates'."
Tohsaka walks off down the hallway.

"...?"
I tilt my head in wonder, but I follow Tohsaka and leave the Tohsaka household.
The second hand on the clock ticks loudly, causing her to look up.
It's past four o'clock.
School's already over and he should be home by now even if he went by the shopping district.

"...I wonder what's going on. Senpai sure is late."
She leans on the wall and murmurs absent-mindedly.

"Huh?"
She feels heavy and dizzy.
She's surprised at how quiet her voice is.
The second hand is annoyingly loud, but her words are almost inaudible.
Only simple sounds echo in her ears.
The monotonous ticking of the clock, and the painful thumping of her heart.
The two sounds enter her brain even if she covers her ears, and her dizziness gets worse.

"That's strange... I'm really not sick anymore."
That's why she sent the housekeeper home.
She was down to her normal temperature when she checked it, and she was able to cook her own lunch.
She was just fine after lunch, and she waited eagerly for his return.

"It's hot"
But her whole body is hot now.
The heat source isn't her, so it has to be something else.
Between her blood vessels. Between her muscles where there are no spaces.
Something that's not her is in there, turning like a car engine.
Her fever is so high that it makes her imagine such a thing, and the abnormality is unprecedented.

The sensation is strange and unpleasant.
She isn't the only one that's in pain.
It's shared by the things in her body, crawling through her blood vessels and nerves.
To speak figuratively, it's like a dog looking for the exit to a can filled with meat.
The heat source, the things within her, are trying their best to fulfill their role.
Thinking about that makes them seem charming, and she cannot make herself hate the sensation.

"...The clock's loud..."
She looks up at the clock absent-mindedly.
It's four-thirty.
A bit longer. He should be back in half an hour.
She has to calm down and suppress the things running around inside of her by then.

"...It's fine... It's happened many times before..."
Yes, she is used to this.
She has been disciplined and reformed many times since she was a child.
She tells herself that it will be no trouble this time eitherbut her fever does not go down, and the things within her keep speeding up.

"...No... This is strange, Senpai."
Her body does not calm down.
She has never been able to.
What's missing, what she needs, and what has changed.
She tries hard to think about these questions, but the ticking of the clock keeps distracting her.

"Huh...? This sound..."
When she realizes the sound is not the clock, but a warning from the house itself...
"Oh, Emiya's not here? That's convenient."
A familiar person enters, barefooted.

"Nii-san."
"Huh? Oh, Emiya's not here and you're getting all hot and horny by yourself? Did I use Rider too much, like the old man said?"
He comes into the living room and walks over to the girl leaning against the wall.

"Oh"
She tries to run, but can't muster the strength.
No, she had no will to run away from the start.
Even if she gets awayshe can never truly escape.

"This is your last order, Sakura. You said you'd do anything, right?"
The one looking down at her is smiling.
"Nii-san."
"Let's go. I have to settle my match with Emiya. I'm sure you want to see him cry, so I'll let you see it up close."
The boy grabs her arm and hauls her to her feet.

"NoI don't want to...!"
She tries to get away, but lacks the strength to do so.
The man pulls her in and grabs her neck.

"Don't disobey me so much, Sakura. You're making me want to kill you. You just have to keep obeying me."
"Noit's not as you promised, Nii-san...! You said you wouldn't do anything to Senpai...!"
She protests, her hair disheveled.
He stops her with his foot.
He has let go and kicked her stomach.

"Uhguh......"
Collapsing to the ground, she lets out a moan.
"I'm being kind. I have the medicine I got from the old man, but I'm not using it."
He forces her to her feet.

"Ah... Ah, uh"
He grabs hold of the coughing girl's neck once again.
"Don't worry, I'll keep my promise. I won't tell him about what happened. But I won't be satisfied until he gets hurt."
He puts his mouth close to her cheeks and whispers in delight.

", Uh"
With her neck held, she shuts her mouth in vexation.
She tries to accept this turn of events, thinking that it always ends up this way.

"Yeah, that's right. Let's go ahead, Sakura. This is Emiya's territory. We have to be in my territory if we're going to play around. Rider, bring this woman with me."
Giving her a violent shove, he exits.
"Ri... der..."
The girl raises her head.
There stands a Servant with long hair.

"I'm home!"
I raise my voice as I go into the house.

...Then.
I feel something strange as soon as I enter.

"The hallway, Emiya-kun."

She doesn't even need to tell me.
There are footprints on the floor.
The only shoes I see are Sakura's.
The housekeeper's aren't there, and the house is dead silent.

"Sakura."
I go into the guest room.
It's empty.
The strange feeling turns into an ominous conviction.

I return to the living room.
Sakura isn't here either.
The footprints end here in the living room.
Somebody came in here with his shoes on, did something in this room, and then went back outside.

"...Emiya-kun. Look at the floor there.
 It's small, but there's a trace of bl"
"I know. Sakura was here."
Yes, I know.
Sakura was waiting for me alone in the living room, but is not here now.

There are unfamiliar footprints in the hallway.
That's all.
It's more strange not to draw a conclusion.
The answer is clear if I think about it just a bit.

Calmly.
Calmly.
Calmly.
Calmly think, and I can tell what happened here.
 So, why
"!"
Why is my head not working at all?

"H-Hey, Emiya-kun...!?"

I should've come home earlier.
I should've thought about it more seriously.
Didn't I have Sakura stay over for fear of just this situation?
Matou Zouken said Sakura is unrelated.
Why did I believe his words?
There's no way she's unrelated when she's part of the Matou family.

So why?
Why did I believe such a convenient story!?


The phone rings.
I nod at Tohsaka and slowly pick up the receiver.

"Hello? Are you finally home, Emiya?"

It's Shinji.
There's no mistake about it, and I knew this was what happened.

"What have you done with Sakura?"
"Huh? I only took back what's mine.  I can't leave her at someone else's house forever."

"Shinji."
"Haha! That's great, you're getting pissed! You're vexed that I took Sakura!"

Tohsaka must be able to hear Shinji's voice, because she's leaning forward.
I raise a hand to stop her and urge him to go on.

"Don't waste my time.  Just tell me what your business is."
"Hehyou should know. Let's decide our match. You don't think that last fight was the end, do you?"
"I do. You ran away. Everything was decided right then."

"It's not decided...! That's the difference in our Servants, not your power! I wouldn't have run away if Saber wasn't there! There's no way I'll lose if Saber doesn't come...!"

If Saber doesn't come...?
...I see.
Rider must not have told Shinji that Saber was eliminated.
Ohthat must be why he kidnapped Sakura.
In short, this phone call is...

"Shinji. What are you going to do with Sakura?"
"Nothing. But that would depend on what you do.
 I won't do anything to Sakura if you come alone. You know what that means, right?"
"!"
I stop Tohsaka.
If she interrupts now, there's no telling what Shinji will do.

"So you want me to fight you without Saber?"
"Yeah, I'm glad you're perceptive when it counts.
 We'll fight at school. Come alone, okay? Rider set up a boundary field over the school. I'll know right away if you bring Saber along.
 If that happensI can't guarantee what'll happen to her."

"Ow...!"
I hear the sound of him kicking something.

"I'll go right away. But just in case, I want to know one thing. Are you a Master, or are you Sakura's brother?"
"Hah...! Are you joking? Why would I be this shit's brother? Well, she's not completely useless because I can lure you out like this."

"All right.
 I'm going to go fight you as a Master."
"Yeah, if it ends up being a fight."

I put the phone down.
I start off right away.

"Hold on...!
 Are you really going to go alone!?"
"That's what he wanted. We can talk later, Tohsaka."

"That's my line.
 Shinji has Sakura as a hostage.
 You'll be killed if you go. Seeing you die will be unbearable for Sakura. We should wait and see, and come up with a plan."

I know.
But we don't have time.
I can still hear her moans in my mind.

"I see. Would Shinji kill me in front of Sakura?"
"Hm... I don't know, but that's highly possible since he's using Sakura as a hostage. ...Hey, are you all right, Emiya-kun? You look calm, but don't tell me you've actually lost your cool."

I've lost my cool?
Is she asking me if I can only think about going to school and punching Shinji in the face?
Oh, then

"Yeah. I can't think of anything else. I'm mad at myself for not saying anything because I thought it was a family matter.
 He said he's not her brother. Such a guy took Sakura."

"He took her, so I'm going to go take her back. Don't do anything, Tohsaka."

I go outside.
The sky is dark, and the sun's about to set.
I bet it'll rain tonight.
I have to come home with Sakura before that.
"Ah."
I throw away the knife.
Trying not to look at the blood, I run to where Sakura is sitting.

"Sakura...!"
"...Senpai"
Sakura doesn't raise her head to look at me.

...She's trying to avoid talking to me.
I don't know if it's because of Shinji, or because of all the things I've hidden from her.
All I can tell is that Sakura's body is hotter than this morning.

"...It's fine. Let's talk later.
 We'll go home for now and"
"...!"
"It's over. The match is decided, Shinji."

...Then.
I realize that Tohsaka is behind me.

After being wounded by Archer, Rider is crouching down on the floor.
 Her clothes are wet with blood.  Even though it's not fatal, she shouldn't be able to continue fighting.

"T-Tohsaka...!?
 Damn, that's not fair! You broke your promise, Emiya...! I told you to come alone!"

"Yeah. But that was an order, not a promise, right? Then I think it's illogical to call it unfair."

"TThat's sophistry! It's natural for him to come alone since he said he'll come alone!"

"...That's fine.
 We were together, but Emiya-kun didn't ask me for help. I came here because I wanted to."

"You're lying...! Why are you here if he didn't get you!?
 Emiya acted honest and tricked me!"

"Oh, that? That's simple. I was next to him when you called. You had such a loud voice, Matou-kun. I was able to hear you even though Emiya-kun was trying to hide it."

"Do you understand now? There's no way I'd just sit there if Sakura's been kidnapped. You lured Emiya-kun to you at the price of making me your enemy."

"Kuhso you're here for Sakura too?
 ...Sakura. Sakura, Sakura, Sakura, SakuraSakuraSakuraSakuraSakura...!
 I don't believe this! Are you still concerned about it!? She's just a quiet bitch that shrinks with fear! Look, I'm a Master!
 You shouldn't worry about them! You should just be concerned about me...!!"

"I see. Then why don't you make your Servant fight?
 Archer only cut her stomach. He hasn't destroyed the core of her embodiment, her neck or her heart. Go ahead and heal Rider if you're a legitimate Master."
"Kuhdamn you...!"

Shinji scrambles away and takes out a book.
"That's"
That's Shinji's Command Spell that burned up at that park.
He still has it...!?

"Get up, Rider! It's your Master's order! Get up and beat Archer...!"

There's no reply.
Rider is crouching, motionless.

A puddle of blood is under her, and the blood keeps flowing.
She is the one who needs help right now.
To order her to fight is to hasten her death.

"Damn...! You're my Servant, so fight until you die, you bitch...!"

Shinji's fingers tighten on the book.
That must be how he uses his Command Spell.  With trembling movements, Rider tries to stand.

"Stopthat's enough, Shinji, give up...! Rider will die if you push her any more...!"
"Hah! Servants don't die that easily! You just shut up and take care of that piece of trash...!"

Shinji does not relent.
"......!"
I let go of Sakura and rush him again.

At that instant...
"...No...! No more...!"

"Sakura?"
I stop and turn back.
Clutching her stomach, she moans as if in the throes of a nightmare.

"Wha!?"
Shinji's book burns to ashes, just as it did that night.

"What?"
Wind blows inside the enclosed hallway.
It's coming from Rider, who was lying on the ground, and from Sakura, who is still crouching.

"No way. This is Rider...?"
Tohsaka stands ready while Archer silently watches the enemy that stood up.
Rider is completely healed.
The power flowing from her body is just like when she was at the Ryudou Temple.

"?"
Then.
Her figure disappears.
Rider suddenly disappears from my vision...

"Get down, Emiya-kun!"
"...!"

The moment I duck, long hair flutters right above me.

"Sakura...!"
Rider has instantly jumped with Sakura in hand.
She lands opposite usbetween Shinji and the rest of us.

"Huh? ...What are you doing? Who told you to bring Sakura?"
"No, there was no such order. As a Servant, I merely protected my Master."

Rider lets Sakura down and glances at Shinji.
...Her eyes are covered with a leather mask, but her expression is frighteningly cold.

"D-Don't be stupid. I'm your Master. Why are you wasting time instead of protecting me"
"Shinji. A Command Spell appears on the body of a Master. I have never accepted anyone who does not bear the holy sign as my Master."

"What?"
"You are a fraud. You have lost the book which granted you false ownership, so I can no longer obey you."

Rider turns away from Shinji.
That motion tells Shinji that she will never look at him again.

"I see. So that's how it was, Rider?"
"Your guess is correct, Archer's Master.
 You already knew, did you not?"

"...Yeah. I knew it was strange.
 There's no way one of the Matous would be chosen as a Master.  Their bloodline has grown thin, so no magi should be born to them."

"So it shouldn't be possible for Shinji, one of the Matou family, to become a Master. But Rider was summoned, and a person from the Matou household was chosen as a Master."

"...Yes. I thought Matou Zouken summoned you and entrusted you to Shinji.
 But it's actually much more simple. Zouken doesn't need to do anything. Because the most appropriate person in the Matou household to be a Master is"

Tohsaka isn't looking at Rider.
She is only looking at...
"The legitimate successor of Matou.
 This generation's magus of the Matou line. It's you, Sakura."
"......"
She's looking straight at Sakura.

"Huh?"
I can't say anything.
Tohsaka and Sakura.
I can only look at them alternately and try to figure out what was just said.

...My left hand hurts.
My relaxed mind finally starts to inform me of the pain on my hand.


I see.
It seems my mind is calm.
Tohsaka's words and the sight of the Command Spell on Sakura's left hand have numbed my senses, butmy mind isn't surprised at all.

Only... why?
Why did such a thing happen?

"........."
Sakura is hanging her head as if trying to hide.
Judging by her body language, she didn't want me to know.

"...Transfer of a Command Spell. A Command Spell ordering her to obey Matou Shinji, huh?
 Rider became Shinji's Servant with that, and you lost your right as a Master at the same time, becoming an ordinary magus. ...So when I first had you show me your arm, you'd already given your Command Spell to Shinji."

"............"
Sakura doesn't answer and bites her lips.

Then.

"Damn, again, Sakura! Give me the right to control her again!"
Shinji runs to her as if begging her.

"............"
"Hey, say something! You don't want to fight, right? You said you didn't want to be a Master, so that's why I took over in your place!
 Why are you pretending to be a good girl now...!?"

Shinji raises his arm.
...But there's no need for me to stop him.
"R-Riderare you going to disobey me?"
"You are not my Master, Shinji. If you intend to harm Sakura, I will kill you."

Rider releases him.
Shinji backs away, clutching his arm where Rider gripped it.

"Ha, hahaI see. You'll regret that, Rider. No matter what you say, everything will be back to normal when Sakura makes another book.
 Do you know what'll happen to you once you become my Servant again?"

"It's useless, Shinji. It's almost impossible to entrust a Servant to a human, and someone that's not a magus at that. The transfer using the Command Spell made it possible."

"Y-Yeah. There's one more Command Spell.
 Sakura won't disobey me, so..."

"That's why this is it. Sakura only has one more Command Spell. If you use it, you'll have no way to control Rider.
 Rider would be freed. You can't bind a Servant with a fake right made with a Command Spell. It'll just burn your book like earlier even if you order Rider."

"Wha Then I'm..."
"Yes. You lost your chance to be a Master.
 No, you were never a Master as you were only controlling her using a fake Command Spell."

...A crack runs through.
With a sound, the existence of Matou Shinji breaks.

"HaHa. I see, so it was impossible from the beginning. I have no talent. The old man cast me aside as a failure, and I was pitied.
 ...Yeah, it's only natural. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it...! I knew from the beginning that I'm not suited!"

"Nii-san."
"No, don't worry about it, Sakura. This was all just a farce. I knew that I have no talent. You're the family's heir. There was no need for me to butt in."

"Nii-san."
"Yeah, I know, I know.
 So, Sakurayou continue."

"Huh...?"
"I'm telling you to beat them

 in my place! Look, Emiya and Tohsaka are enemies! You're the successor of Matou, so act like one...!"

"Shinjihaven't you heard a thing I've said?
 Sakura won't fight, and you have no right. We won't attack you, since you don't have Rider anymore. Just stay in hiding until the Holy Grail War ends."

"I'm not asking you. Come on, Sakura. I'm telling you. You're going to obey me like always, right?"

"......"
There's no reply.
Sakura clenches her fists, turns her back to Shinji, 
"...I don't want to. Let's stop, Nii-san."
and clearly refuses his order.

"Sakura. What did you just say?"
"...I don't want to. You broke your promise. You said you wouldn't kill Senpai, but you broke our promise.
 So"


Sakura doesn't turn to look at Shinji.
Shinji looks at it like someone else's matter and laughs.


I feel a chill, and in that instant...
"All right. Then you can die."
I hear the sound of glass breaking.

"Ahh!"
Sakura falls.
Her knees lose strength and she falls to the ground.

"Hah, bye, Sakura! If you're going to hold a grudge, don't hold it at me, but hold it against that old man for making your body like that. Well, you were gonna end up like that anyway. It's better for you to be freed from the pain now!"
Shinji runs away.

"Ahha, ah!"
Sakura tears at her chest.
Her earring breaks and chemical-like liquid is pouring out of it.

"Ahnono......!"
She goes into convulsions.
No, it's worse.
Sakura's shaking so bad that it seems like she's going to crumble like a building in an earthquake.

"Sakura...!"
I don't get what's going on.
In my worry, I run to her.

"Fool! Don't you understand what's going on!?"
"...!"
Someone stops me.
I don't know when he got here, but Archer is grabbing my shoulder.

"Get away from here. You will not be able to restore her if you feed her without care."
Archer pushes me back and says something strange.

"Feed her...? What do you mean?"
The question dies in my throat.


The hallway tints red.
The air becomes a mist, moistening our skin, and every wall starts to sweat like honey.

"Ow, guh!?"
...My chest is burning.
This air.
This red world is a different world made by magic.
This must be a boundary field that melts everything within its framework, on this premise.

"Tohsaka, this is"
I can't breathe.
No, the mist clogs my throat and burns me from the inside when I breathe.

"...It's the boundary field Shinji set up here.
 But it's much stronger now that Sakura is Rider's Master."
"Wha"

I look.
...On the other side of the hallway is Sakura, clawing at her chest in agony, and Rider, who is confronting Archer to protect Sakura.

"Move aside, Rider. Your master is running wild. She will be addicted to it unless she is stopped before she gets a taste of another's magical energy."
"I refuse. My role is to protect my Master. I cannot let you through as long as you are trying to kill Sakura."

"...Oh. So you will stand there and let your master die? Your Master is using up magical energy at a high rate. Do you understand that she will certainly die if you leave her alone?"

"No. She can avoid death if she takes in more magical energy than she loses.
 Fortunately, there are two magi here. Shinji escaped, but they cannot escape now. I shall take your Master before Sakura is consumed."

"Hehso your character doesn't change even with a new Master, huh?
 It seems you value yourself over other people's lives."
"That goes for you too. You are trying to protect your Master by ignoring mine."
"I seethen there's no need for either one of us to hold back!"

Archer charges.
...Without heed for the corrosive boundary field, he rushes at where Sakura still crouches on the ground.
And he clashes with Rider as she blocks his way.

"Heyare you okay with this, Tohsaka!? He started fighting with Rider...!"
"...Of course they have to fight. We won't last like this. ...And as a fellow magus, I have to prevent Sakura from becoming a heretic."

"Huh?"
Heretic...?
Are those people who use magic against the law of the Association, or people who cannot stop the Magic Circuit and destroy themselves...?

"Wait. What is that? Why Sakura?"
"She's running wild. Rider made this boundary field, but Sakura's the one maintaining it. I don't know what Shinji did, but Sakura's attacking indiscriminately now."

"...I bet Sakura is like us. It's just painful and she just wants air, so she's sucking on other people's air, or magical energy in this case. I can't leave her be as the supervisor of Fuyuki."

"Wha? You can't leave her be? What are you going to do to Sakura!?"
"...Ask Archer. I only know of one way to stop a magus like that. But Archer might know of some other way."

"...Well, we have to do something about Rider before that anyway. From what I can see, Archer is the stronger of the two, but it seems his output is down."
"...Output is down?"

I look back at the hallway.
Archer is overwhelming, even in my eyes.
In terms of pure power, he is stronger. There's no way that Rider can hold him back.


But.
It's strange.

Rider's strength is her agility.
She shouldn't be good at fights where she has to protect someone.
Being forced to protect someone should put her at a disadvantage.
Archer should've already defeated her and moved on to Sakura.
But that's not the caseso could Rider be overwhelming him...?

"Fu!"
Archer's sword swings through empty air.
Her hair flowing as she moves, Rider arches back and avoids the attack, then steps in and slashes at Archer.

But Rider isn't the only one who attacks and defends at the same time.
Archer repels Rider's dagger with his other sword and pushes her back.

Advance and retreat.
They are evenly matched. Archer cannot press forward, Rider cannot force him back, and they consequently clash swords without any progress.

"Kuh"
The impatient one is Archer.
Though his enemy is weaker than him, he cannot repel her, and the boundary field is slowly taking his energy.

And to add, Tohsaka and I are at our limits.
Just stopping our breaths is painful, so being in the hallway stabs at our minds.
At this pace, we'll fall before Archer defeats Rider.

"Damn"
Archer clucks his tongue in annoyance.
There.

"I understand your power.
 I am sorry, but you cannot defeat me."
Rider stops and makes an announcement in a regretful voice.

"What...?"
"I said you cannot beat me. You are not using your Noble Phantasm. I do not know if your Master has forbidden you from doing so or if you are concerned for Sakura's safety.
 Regardless, if you will not use it, this is it. You cannot defeat me."

Planting her feet, her only weapon, Rider confronts Archer.
...She looks so defenseless that the match could be decided if Archer attacked her now.

"...Hah. I'm not worried for your Master. I just think that there is no need.
 And you cannot use your Noble Phantasm either. Matou Shinji was your Master until just now, so you do not have enough magical energy stocked up to use it."

"Yes. Shinji could not give me magical energy. So I cannot use my Noble Phantasm right now."

"...That's right. There's no need to waste my magical energy against an opponent who will not use it. I will slash you with my next attack, proceed and slash that girl, and everything will end."

"Yes. Let's say that's how it will be.
 It will be easier for me to kill you if that is the case."
Rider answers calmly.

What does she intend to do?
Without even readying her weapon, Rider stands against Archer...
"...No, Rider...!"
...but stops when she hears the voice.

"Please endure there, Sakura. I will solve everything."
"Stopplease stop, Rider. I didn't call for you for something like this."
"...I cannot follow that order. Your life takes priority above all else."

Rider raises her arm.
There's four meters between her and Archer.
Maintaining that distance, the black Servant puts her hand on her wrap text="face"]face and...

"Also...
 This is what you wished for, Sakura."
...She releases the black seal.

  Everything solidifies at that instant.

Rider's naked eyes.
They are inhuman eyes, one of the highest rank among numerous mystic eyes.


Grey eyes.
They look like crystals, and they are too abnormal to be called eyeballs.

The corneas do not take in light.
The pupil sees the world through a square.
The iris is solidified, not allowing the eyes to close.
The millions of cells that make up the retina are composed of ether.

Are they art that the gods admired, or are they nature that the gods cursed?
Rider's gray eyes are abnormal, and at the same time, too beautiful for any human to have.

 "!"
Archer is frozen in place.
...It must be because he saw her eyes from such close range.
His eyes are frozen even if he wants to close them, and his arms are frozen even if he wants to cover his eyes.
He tries to charge forward and slash at Rider, but his legs are already petrified up to his knees.

"No way, mystic eyes of petrification...!?"
Tohsaka's voice is almost a scream.
...I can't tell what kind of face she's making.
My eyes are also captivated by Rider's mystic eyes, and I can't look away.
My blood is thickening.
The flow is solidified, and my senses are ceased.

Mystic eyes.
A single action magic that magi have.

It takes the eyes, passive receptors of the world, and makes them function actively to influence the world.
It indiscriminately casts its magic upon anyone within sight, though the effect is vastly increased if the target meets your gaze.
In short, it's something not to be looked at, and it is a frightening magical nature that entraps anyone that looks at them.

Their abilities and concealable nature make the mystic eyes proof of a first-rate magus.
The technique to make one's own eyes into a Magic Circuit is close to that of a Magic Crest.

But then, artificial mystic eyes only have strong enough powers to cast Charm or Whisper.
Possessors of truly powerful mystic eyes are always born with them.

Binding. Coercion. Contract. Burning. Illusion. Extreme luck.
Mystic eyes that directly intervene with another's fate are called Noble Color, and among the highest-ranked of them are the eyes of petrification.

No magus of this age possesses these eyes.
There are only a few magi that make petrification magic possible.
How great a miracle is it to be possible to petrify others just by looking?

...Breaker Gorgon.
It is the curse of the gods sealed by the powers of shrines.
It is said that such evil eyes were only possessed by evil beasts and spirits in the age of the gods.
The magical Noble Phantasm that can petrify people with its glance, the symbol of the heroic spirit Medusa!

"Get away, Rin! The real attack is coming...!"
Archer screams, his body now petrified up to his waist.
...Beyond him...
A dark-red wave is expanding from within Rider, who has released her mystic eyes.

"Wait... even if you tell me...!"
Tohsaka is moving too slowly.
Something terrible is flowing forth from the other side of the hallway.
The wave becomes sharp like a spear and aims straight at Tohsaka.


She'll die.
Tohsaka must be more entranced than me, as she cannot even move a step.
Unable to dodge, she will be impaled by the spear.
With the scene of several seconds in the future in mind, I...
There's no time to think.
I can still move my legs and arms.
Then I just need to move forward and pull Tohsaka

"Tohsaka!"
"What?"
Tohsaka doesn't even budge when I grab her arm and pull.
It seems she's heavier than she looks.

"Damn, you're heavy!"
She doesn't move even when I pull with both my arms.
Then all that's left is...
"Damn, just move!"
I charge at her to push her away...!

"Ow."
I hear a dull piercing sound.

"W-What are you doing!?"
"Toh"
I can't hear her voice clearly.

...My body is burning.
Everything is hazy, as though I have a high fever.

"Senpai?"

...A familiar voice from a distance.
My sense of reality is fading.
My mind whites out and my left arm bleeds red, mixing like paint.

"No."

I see Sakura staring at me as I fall to the floor.

"Nooooooo...!!!"

And she falls to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut.

"How do you feel? Have you calmed down?"

Sitting on the church's long bench, I nod silently.

"I see. Then there's no need for treatment. Your wounds should all heal as your energy returns, so just rest for now."

Tohsaka sits a bit away from me.
...The distance between our minds is much greater than this.
There's no idle conversation as we wait for Kotomine.

"!"
My left hand screams with pain when I clench it.
It feels like there's a nail driven through my palm.
The cut from grabbing the knife hurts more than the bruises from Rider or the stab wound from Sakura.

The dark clouds block the view of the night sky.
The rain clouds tell me that it's going to rain soon.

"......"
...I guess the spear-like thing that attacked Tohsaka was Sakura's magic.

The magical nature that the Matou household inherits is "absorption".
When lack of magical energy made Sakura suffer, she unconsciously cast the spell.
She probably aimed at Tohsaka because she had the most magical energy there.
It stabbed and entangled around my arm because I pushed Tohsaka away, and it sucked all the magical energy out of me.

Magical energy is life force.
It's natural for me to lose consciousness when it's sucked out of me.
I'd already used up my energy when I fought Rider, so I easily fell unconscious, and Tohsaka brought me to the church after that.
...I hear Sakura fainted when she saw me fall.

"She attacked herself."
Tohsaka murmurs and explains to me that she's getting treated in the back right now.
I'm the only one who can move.
Archer and Tohsaka are sealed by Rider's mystic eyes.
Then I just need to get the main cause!

I run at Rider.
Even if I can't beat her, I should at least be able to make her look away from Archer for a second...!

"...!? Are you stupid...!? Don't look directly at her...!"
I ignore Archer's voice and run at Rider.

If those are mystic eyes of petrification, I just need to close my eyes.
The hallway is small.
I know how much distance there is between us.
Rider can attack me or I can haphazardly attack her. Either way, Archer should be able to do something during that opening...!

But my legs freeze.
    No, they are literally petrified.

"Wh"
It's not just my legs.
The petrification does not stop and reaches my waist, hardens my chest, destroys my arms, and locks up my closed eyes forever.
"Why?"

"How foolish.
 Trying to block my mystic eyes by merely closing your eyes. It doesn't matter if you look at me with your naked eyes or your mind's eye, as it is a curse to look at me in any way."

", "
I can't move my throat or my mouth.
...I can't even tell what's going on.
Even if Tohsaka screamed, or if Archer fell to the ground...
I have no way to know, as I'm petrified.

My body has turned to stone, and my mind is swiftly following.
...The three sisters from the legend are immortal.
Just like them, my body will never change.
My legs won't move.
I can't move and can only watch as the black spear pierces Tohsaka...
"What?"
And I see it change its course at the last second.

The weapon wavers.
The weapon that came flying at Tohsaka changes its direction at the very last moment.
The black spear rotates.
As if it has found better prey, it lances towards me.

"Ow."
A dull piercing sound.
...My body is burning.
My vision is wavering as if I have a high fever.

"Senpai?"

...A familiar voice from a distance.
My sense of reality is fading.
My mind whites out and my left arm bleeds red, mixing like paint.

"No."

I see Sakura staring at me as I fall to the floor.

"Nooooooo...!!!"

And she falls to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut.

"How do you feel? Have you calmed down?"

Sitting on the church's long bench, I nod silently.

"I see.  Then there's no need for treatment.  Your wounds should all heal as your energy recovers, so just rest for now."

Tohsaka sits a bit away from me.
...The distance between our minds is much greater than this.
There's no idle conversation as we wait for Kotomine.

"!"
My left hand screams with pain when I clench it.
It feels like there's a nail driven through my palm.
The cut from grabbing the knife hurts more than the bruises from Rider or the stab wound from Sakura.

The dark clouds block the view of the night sky.
The rain clouds tell me that it's going to rain soon.

"......"
...I guess the spear-like thing that attacked Tohsaka was Sakura's magic.

The magical nature that the Matou household inherits is "absorption".
When lack of magical energy made Sakura suffer, she unconsciously cast the spell.
It stabbed and entangled around my arm because Sakura needed help, and it sucked all the magical energy out of me.

Magical energy is life force.
It's natural for me to lose consciousness when it's sucked out of me.
I'd already used up my energy when I fought Rider, so I easily fell unconscious, and Tohsaka brought me to the church after that.
...I hear Sakura fainted when she saw me fall.

"She attacked herself."
Tohsaka murmurs and explains to me that she's getting treated in the back right now.
I smell rain.
The plaza is empty, and no one is visiting the church.
There...

Stands a man, waiting for me without his master.

"Archer."
I strangely don't wonder....
Why he's here and why he's waiting for me.

The red knight silently stares at me and closes his eyes once as if to part with something.
"You know, right, Emiya Shirou?
 What you are fighting against, and who you must kill."

He clearly states the question I must answer.


His words freeze my heart.
...I know.
I vowed to fight to stop the war, to stop Masters who involve innocent people.

That was my decision, and that's why I asked for Saber's help.
I can't go back on my word.
ThenSakura is the Master I should be stopping first.


I know, but I can't say anything.

The knight in red remains silent.
We stand there staring at each other under the gray sky.

"......Then do as you wish. My goal has changed. Now that the thing has appeared, it is not the time to be caring about personal grudges."
"What......?"

"...This is a warning.
 If you're going to protect the belief you've had until now, that's fine.
 Butif you choose another path, there will be no future for Emiya Shirou."
"Does that mean I'm going to die?"

"If you equate self-imprisonment with death.
 Isn't that right? You have existed until now to let people live. How can you throw away that oath and discard everyone to save one person?"

His declaring words contain no scorn.
Archer's words contain determination and emptiness.

"I don't know which path Emiya Shirou will choose.
 But if you are to deny everything you've done to save one personthe crime will definitely judge you."

...Archer leaves.
Unable to stop him, I start down the hill, paralyzed by indecision.

When I finally come back to myself, I'm sitting on the bench in the park.
I don't feel like going home, and I can't wait at the church.

This park is far away from both.
...It's been a few hours since I found out Sakura is a Master.
Its location suits an indecisive guy like me.


An answer.
I have to come up with an answer, but my brain is so messed up that I can't even come up with what I should be thinking about.

She has suffered sexual abuse. It is easy to imagine what kind of training Matou Zouken imposed on her.
 To be blunt,  Matou Sakura is not a pure virgin, but a woman who has known men

".........Shut... up."
Don't repeat it.  I understand.
I'm a magus, even if I'm just an amateur.
I know what it means, and I can tell what Sakura has been through

That girl tried to hide that fact from you, but always sought salvation. Someone who sat by, oblivious, has no right to care for her

"Shut up, shut up, shut up...! I know. You don't have to tell me such a thing!"
...Such a thing...
Why couldn't I notice it?

"......!"
One of my back teeth cracks.
I grit my teeth too much today. It's a wonder it didn't break until now.

"DamnDamn, damn, damn!"
I grind on the bare nerves.
Pain assails my brain.
But it can't even drown out the hatred in my brain.


A fire ignites inside my head.
Now that I know the truth, thinking about our time together drives me crazy.

Sakura was smiling.
She was always smiling gently.
I never knew what kind of pain she went through, and I accepted her as a matter of course.

...I don't care if her smiles were real or fake.
It makes me want to kill him, just thinking about what kind of pain was hidden behind her smiles.

"Matou Zouken!"
I can't forgive him.
I don't need recompensation. I want to eliminate him and remove him from Sakura's life.

Because everything is his fault.
Sakura would've been able to live as a normal girl, and she would've never had a crest worm in her body if it wasn't for him.
She wouldn't have become a Master, and Shinji wouldn't have lost himself if Zouken didn't exist.
So...
If he had never existed, none of this would've happened!

I punch the bench.
The wound on my hand opens up, and blood drips down onto the white bench.
The clear colors transfer into my head.

"How stupidwhat would've happened if he didn't exist?"
I'm disgusted with my own foolishness.

"...That has nothing to do with this. Why am I pushing the responsibility onto someone else?"
Why am I trying to make myself feel better?
I won't deny what Matou Zouken has done to Sakura.
Just thinking about it disgusts me.  It makes me jealous, as if something important has been taken away.

But it doesn't lessen my guilt.
I'm the one who didn't notice.
No matter what Zouken did, it's my fault for not noticing.

"No. It's not that I didn't notice. I..."
I just didn't try to notice.
The night when I confronted Zouken.
He said Sakura was unrelated, and I believed him.

...How stupid of me.
Why did I believe his words?
There's no way she'd be unrelated when she's of the Matou family.
On the night I lost Saber, I realized Matou Zouken is a monster who doesn't care about other people's lives.

If that monster gave Rider to Shinji, there's no way he'd do nothing to Sakura.

But...
I believed his words because they were convenient for me.

I could've easily realized it.
It's something I could've guessed with even a little thought.
...That's why I wasn't surprised.
I knew it was obvious when I found out Sakura's a Master and that she's been raped until now.
But I didn't think about it because I couldn't keep going if I realized it.

If I realized, I'd have to fight.
If Matou Zouken is evil...
The superhero has to fight against him.


...No.
It's clear what I must do.
If Sakura is going to be Zouken's puppet and use Rider to indiscriminately attack people, it's clear what I must do.

That's why I learned magic.
I've been able to live because I have to save people from unreasonable disasters.

"!"
So it's clear.
It's just like that red knight said.

Senpai. If I become a bad person

I don't want to hurt Sakura, and I feel sympathy.
But there can be no exceptions.
No matter how important it is to me, if it would create a disaster like that time...

Yes. I wouldn't mind if you do so.

"Uh, guh......!"
...I just need to eliminate it.
I shouldn't have to think twice, so why...
"Haa, uh, guh!"
Why am I desperately trying to keep myself from throwing up...?

"Ahhaa... haa, haa, haa"
I endure the nausea.
...How long has it been?
I don't have time to be worrying about stupid things.
Tohsaka said she'd be back when the surgery ends.
The town smells like rain.
I have to go back to the church before it starts raining, find out how Sakura's doing, and

"Let's play, Shirou!"
I'm suddenly embraced from behind.

"...Ilya."
I can tell without turning around.
The one I meet at this park is always this white girl.

"Heehee, were you surprised? I had to greet you because I saw you."
Ilya laughs cheerfully.


Her innocence is painful right now.
I know it's selfish of me, but I don't want anyone smiling in front of me right now.

"Oh. What's going on, Shirou? Why are you ignoring me? It's rude to keep looking down when a girl's talking to you."
"......"
...I wish she'd be quiet.
I don't have the composure to talk with someone right now.

"Humph. Hey, Shirou! You have to listen when people talk to you!"
"......Ilya. I'm sorry, but I can't afford to do so right now.
 If you want to play, you'll have to do it by yourself."

"What? I got to see you, so that's boring.
 You never came here after that day. If I let you go today, I bet you won't come again."

"...I didn't promise to meet you here every day. And it's night already. Don't Masters kill each other at night?"

My unkind words bring a renewed wave of nausea.
...I hate myself so much that I want to punch myself.
I'm driving Ilya away so that I can be at ease.

"Why? You're not a Master anymore, right? So I'm going to let you go for tonight."
"'I'm not a Master anymore'... Ilya?"

"Hah. There's nothing I don't know about. You lost Saber, and Rin was almost defeated by Rider. But Rider's Master collapsed, so there are only two more left."
Ilya speaks cheerfully.


It looks like she knows about Sakura's condition and...

"It's obvious now who's going to win. Rider's Master will self-destruct, and Archer isn't a big deal.
 No one can beat my Berserker now that Saber's gone.
 See, so let's play! You're not a Master anymore, so I'll specially invite you to my castle!"

Ilya hugs me without reserve.
Seeing her innocent smile makes me so angry that...
"Shut up...! I said I don't have such time! Go play by yourself if you want to play around!"
"Kya...!?"
I push Ilya away in a fit of rage.

"Oh"
It's too late to regret what I've done.
Ilya is standing there in shock.
I can tell without looking how shocking that must've been for her.

...I have pushed aside an honest, pure show of affection.
It's like a parent rejecting a child.
I have just ruined everything Ilya felt for me.


She stares at me in silence.

"......"
Unable to hold her gaze, I look down
"I'm sorry, Shirou."
A small hand pats my head.

"...What?"
I raise my head again.
Ilya is looking at me with a worried expression.

"......Ilya. Aren't you going to get mad?"
"No. You're about to cry, Shirou. I don't know what happened, but it'd be too bad for you if I hate you. So I'll be your ally no matter what you do."


My vision is covered in white.
...It's just one phrase.
But that phrase washes everything away from my head.

"My... ally?"
"Yeah. It's natural to protect the ones you love, right?
 Even I know that."

Someone's ally.
Ilya easily tells me the motive to be on someone's side.


...I know what's right and what's wrong.
What I've protected until now, and what I want to protect right now.
I know which choice is correct, and which is wrong.
With that in mind, I
I open the door.
Tohsaka is already here, standing in the corner of the chapel.
She's not sitting down but standing there, and I can see her determination.
She has the cold face of a magus, saying Sakura will be her enemy if the crest worm isn't removed.

"......"
Tohsaka doesn't look at me, and I have nothing to say to her either.
The sound of rain echoes inside the chapel.
How long has it been?

"The operation is complete. There is nothing more I can do."
Breaking the deep silence, Kotomine Kirei appears.

"Ehhey, Kirei. What happened to your Magic Crest?"
"Hm, you can tell? As you can see, I used all of it on Matou Sakura's treatment."
"Y-You used it all?"
Tohsaka is astonished.

"......?"
I don't get it.
All I can tell is that something happened to Kotomine's Magic Crest, and Tohsaka is surprised about it.

"D-Do you understand? We're talking about a Magic Crest here!
 Why does something you built up for generations go away in just a few hours...!?"

"It could not be helped. The Crest I received from my father is not permanent, like the one you have. It is a consumption type that goes away the more I use it. We have never been a family of magi to begin with.
 You can think of it as a lower-rank Command Spell."

"Then you really..."
"Yes. I've used up all of it for the treatment. It was the extraction of an eleven-year old pus. It should not be surprising that it took all of my remaining Crest."


...We both gasp.
The priest is saying he used all of his Magic Crest to treat Sakura.
Tohsaka's expression tells me how valuable the compensation was.
Kotomine threw away all of his fortune for Sakura.

"...Kotomine."
"What? Do not tell me it's troubling for you. You two are the ones who told me to save her. I merely answered your wish."

"Oh... no. It's not troubling at all. ...Um, thank you."
"Do not thank me. You will take it back later anyway."
"Take it back later...?"
Does that mean

"So, how's Sakura? You did that much, so"

"She escaped death, but it is just temporary.
 I was able to remove most of the crest worm, but some parts were buried too deeply to be removed. Some of it has eaten into the nerves. I can extract it all if I remove her heart, but that will kill Sakura as well."

"All I could do was to remove the crest worm that did not metabolize with her nerves, decreasing her pain and the pressure from Zouken. Her life should have ended tonight, but I prolonged it on a whim. Well, it will all be vain effort if the worm in her nerves start moving again."

"Whathen Sakura is..."
"It means nothing has changed.
 She will have no problem living normally, but Zouken can easily drive her berserk.
 That old man can force her to fight, whether she wants to or not. In short, she is a bomb with a lit fuse."


I'd be lying if I said I'm not agitated.
But I'm not surprised or puzzled.
I've made my decision already.
I chose to be on Sakura's side, no matter what happens, no matter what state she's in.

"I see. Then there's only one thing left to do. I'm sorry for making you use you Crest."

Tohsaka starts to walk.
I instantly understand what she's going to do.
"Hey, stop, Tohsaka...!"
I grab Tohsaka's hand and stop her.

"What? Talk to me later."
"What are you saying? Are you planning to kill Sakura?"
"Hey, it's something that has to be done. Didn't you come here, prepared for that?"

I know what's right.
The thing that keeps me alive.
I can't turn my back on the thing that has kept me alive.

"I'm sorry, Ilya. I can't follow such an obvious thing."
I turn my mind into steel.
That's it.
The gastric juice coming up my throat, the pain in my stomach, and the tears in eyes. Everything stops.

I can't let my conviction waver.
For the sake of everyone who could not be saved, I can't let any more people share in their fate.

"...I see. So you're choosing the same method as Kiritsugu. You're going to cast away the person you love most for people you don't even know about."


The man who turned away from the Einzberns for something he believed was right.
I've chosen the same path.
Ilya has been betrayed twice now.
Not choosing Sakura also means not choosing Ilya.

"That's right. Kiritsugu and I are the same. If you want to curse someone, you can curse me."
My mind has turned into hard steel.
Getting scorned or cursed is not heavy for me at all.

The silver-haired girl doesn't say anything.
I have denied her wish, so now would be the time to take her revenge on Kiritsugu.
But...

"I pity you, Shirou.
 You're going to be deceiving yourself forever with that crying face of yours."

Ilya tells me goodbye with a fading smile.

It starts to rain.
There's no one in the park.
It should be over at the church by now.

I open the door.
Tohsaka is already here, standing in the corner of the chapel.
She's not sitting down but standing there, and I can see her determination.
She has the cold face of a magus, saying Sakura will be her enemy if the crest worm isn't removed.

"......"
Tohsaka doesn't look at me, and I have nothing to say to her either.
The sound of rain echoes inside the chapel.
How long was it?

"The operation is complete. There is nothing more I can do."
Breaking the deep silence, Kotomine Kirei appears.

"........So, how's Sakura, Kirei?"
"I have done my best. That is all I can say."
The result is as expected.
There was never a chance that Sakura could be saved.

"Matou Sakura is sleeping. She should wake up tomorrow morning.
 What will you do as the successor of the Tohsaka family, Rin?"
"I don't even need to say it. It's the supervisor's duty to eliminate a magus who has turned into a heretic. All the more so if the magus is a relative of mine."

The back of the chapel.
Tohsaka walks on, probably heading to the room Sakura's sleeping in.

"Aren't you going to stop me, Emiya-kun?"
Tohsaka turns back to me at the door.
I reply with silence.

"So you won't mind even if I kill Sakura?"
"I have nothing to say. Butif I can take your place, I will."
"No. This is my role. I can't give you this role."

Tohsaka opens the door and disappears inside.
"I'm surprised. I thought you would stop her."

"...Hm. It seems you are determined.
 The Holy Grail War will now return to normal. This is a bit disappointing, but I am looking forward to the end."

"...What's there to look forward to? Are you predicting who will win?"
"Predict? There is no need to predict.
 You will win.
 Since you have cast away Matou Sakura, you will use any means possible to kill Matou Zouken, Ilyasviel, and Rin. I am saying I am looking forward to how this will end."

"...Why? I won't fight Tohsaka. There's no reason for me to stop her, even if she's going to obtain the Holy Grail."

"You will fight her. You will be forced to fight her when you find out about the true identity of the Holy Grail. Having killed Matou Sakura, Rin will go mad unless she obtains the Holy Grail.
 She will try to win for her belief, and you will try to destroy the Holy Grail for your ideal.
 You two are incompatible with each other now. You two shall act out the final stage of the Holy Grail War."

The priest leaves the chapel as well.
...The room Sakura and Tohsaka are in.
He knows what happened there is already over.

"Are you saying I will remain until the very end?"
"Of course. You are Emiya Kiritsugu now. There is no way you cannot win."

...The priest has left.
The only one in the chapel is Emiya Shirou, with a mind of steel.


The priest's words are true.
I will continue fighting, defeat Zouken, Ilya, and Tohsaka, and destroy the Holy Grail.

That is the end of this war.
That is the responsibility I took when I swore to be a superhero.
It is the first price I have to pay to become my ideal.

There's no need to talk about the obvious outcome.
Emiya Shirou will turn his mind to steel, and become a superhero.
Morning.
When the bright sunlight wakes me, I realize my neck is stiff.

"Mmwhoa......"
My neck feels heavy because my shoulders are stiff.
I probably strained my neck when I slept on my stomach.

On the other hand, my back feels much better now.
I don't feel any pain, so it shouldn't hinder my normal life.
"Crap. It's past seven."

"Ouch!"
I feel a sharp pain in my stomach.
It's fine as long as I stay still, but it hurts when I suddenly move.

"It's a bruise, so I bet it'll hurt for a while."
But it's nothing I can't endure.
It's not like it's bad enough to stop me from moving, so I should be able to act normally.

I get changed and leave my room.
I smell breakfast from the living room, so I bet Sakura's preparing it.

"Morning. I'm sorry I slept in. Is there anything I can still help with?"
"Good morning, Senpai. It's rare for you to sleep in."
"Ugh, I'm sorry. Um, it was already morning when I noticed."

"It can't be helped because you're injured. I went to wake you up earlier, but you didn't even show signs of waking up. I think your body's tired."

Wow.
I have no memory of Sakura coming to wake me up.
Not only are my shoulders stiff, but it seems my head is still asleep.

"I'm sorry. I'm gonna go wash my face. I'll be back right away."
"No, please take your time. I'll prepare breakfast by myself today, so please go wash your face."
Sakura is really energetic.

"......?"
Well, if she's making the offer, I shouldn't turn her down.
"Then I'll go ahead and go wash my face."

"Yes. I'm confident in today's miso soup, so please look forward to it."
I nod and head into the hallway.

"Wait."
Something's strange.
I went past her without caring because she was energetic, but this is just like

"......!"
I hear something falling to the ground.
I don't know if it's because I've heard it many times these past few days, but I realize it's the sound of someone falling.

"Sakura!"
I run back into the living room.
...Sakura must have been on the ground, as she slowly raises her upper body.

"Sakura."
I support her staggering body.

"......!"
Her body is hot, just like before.
Her breathing is ragged and her shirt is wet with her sweat, telling me how bad her condition is.

"OhSenpai."
She must have come to her senses.
Sakura looks at me with unfocused eyes.

"Geez. I told you to take your time, but you came back right away. ...Um, please hold on. I'll prepare breakfast right away."
She smiles and brushes my hand off of her.

"Sakura."
It doesn't seem like she's pushing herself, but rather that she doesn't notice she's sick.

"Hold on. You don't have to make breakfast. Just go back to your room and lie down. You have a high fever."
"Huh...? I have a fever?"

"Yes. ...Damn, it's really bad if you don't know it yourself! Why"
Why didn't I notice something so obvious?
Even though I was depressed about Saber, there's something wrong with me if I can't care for Sakura's health.

"Um, Senpai...? I'm really fine. I just fell, so it's not like I'm dizzy or anything..."

"Don't say stupid things! You have such a high fever! I don't even need a thermometer to tell that!"

"Oh"

I pull her into the living room.
I have to let Sakura rest for now.
I'll report to the school that she's going to be absent, make some breakfast that's easy to digest, and for lunchyeah, I'll ask Fujimura's old man and have one of their housekeepers come over.

"U-Um... where are you going, Senpai? We have to eat breakfast before we go to school."

Sakura still hasn't grasped the situation.
All her energy must have been a result of the fever.

"You're not going to school. You're resting in your room today. I'll let the school know. I'm going to see Fuji-Nee in class, so I'll tell her then."

"EhI'm not going to school?"
"Right. Who else would it be? I'm... well, I'm injured, but I'll be fine. There's no reason for me to stay home."


...Well, there's no reason for me to push myself and go to school. Because I lost Saber, I don't have such liberty.
But there's something I have to do.
I can't be staying in my house until I go tell Tohsaka about last nightabout Matou Zouken and Assassin.

"Anyway, you're to stay home today. You're working hard every day, so you can rest once in a while. I'll come home right away after I'm done with my business."

"Ohno, I'm really fine...!
 So let's eat breakfast and go to school. This fever will go away if I do...!"
"Such a thing won't happen, you idiot. You're being absurd, Sakura."

"I-I'm not being absurd!
 You're the one being reckless. I'm feeling perfectly fine, and you're injured! But I'm the only one staying home? That's"
"Eh... Whoa, Sakura!"

"Huh? That's strange, Senpai. I'm... having trouble... breathing"
Sakura's breathing hard and is about to fall to the ground.

...I support her, but her body is heavy.
She must not have the power to stand up, or maybe she can't stand up because her body is heavy.
Either way, Sakura's so sick that she can't walk by herself, and she's the only one who thinks she's fine.

"...You idiot. Look, I'm going to make you stay home today no matter what. I don't care if you don't like it or not, but you'll end up staying home tomorrow too if you use up extra energy."

"......But, Senpai. I... have to... go to school."
Delirious, Sakura punctuates her sentence with ragged breaths.

Ignoring her, I lift her up and head to the guest room.

She's already asleep when I get there.
But she must still be semi-conscious.
She's breathing painfully and takes a firm grip on my arm.


I lay her on the bed.
"Oh... Senpai...?"
Her voice is vague.
Sakura is staring at the ceiling, not at me.

"Sakura."
Her ragged breathing, flushed cheeks, sweat-dampened clothes, and heaving breasts...

"!"
She looks so erotic that I quickly look away.
Why am I so imprudent when Sakura's sick!?

"...Crap. I guess I'll have to ask their housekeeper."
...I can't change her clothes or wipe her down.

Her breathing has calmed down since she is lying down, so she should get better with some fever medicine.
Once she can walk again, I can take her to the hospital to go get some medicine.

"Sakura. I'm going to go get someone, so sleep until then. You're familiar with Fuji-Nee's housekeeper, right?"

There's no reply.
Her breathing still sounds painful, but it seems she's asleep.

"Phew. You're obstinate in weird ways, Sakura. Why do you want to go to school so bad?"
I'm just talking to myself.
I know there won't be a reply because Sakura's asleep.

"Bye. I'm going to school."
I step away from the bed and head to the door.
Then.
"...I want to go to school with you, Senpai."
I hear her answer.

"Sakura...?"
I turn around.
Sakura is still asleep, and her eyes are closed painfully.
"...Oh, she's just talking in her sleep."

I leave the guest room.
On my way out...

"......Because I have to protect Senpai."

She says this in feverish tones.

I drop by Fuji-Nee's place on my way to school to have their housekeeper come by.
I sometimes forget because Fuji-Nee's not the type to dress up, but the Fujimura family is one of the richest households around here.

It has dozens of scary-looking people that call themselves company employees even though it's not even a company.
Many of them live in the outbuilding, so they are a large family.
So there are many housekeepers, and one will be free to spare if I ask.

So.
I get one of the emergency housekeepers, who took care of my place a few times before Sakura started coming over.
She's acquainted with Sakura, so I can trust her to take care of her.

I wait for Tohsaka by the front gate.
The sky is gray, and it looks like it'll rain any minute now.
There's a chill wind, so it'll be a cold night if it rains.

"What are you thinking about?"
Then.
Tohsaka is in front of me when I notice.
She must have ran here, as her shoulders are moving up and down.

"Nothing. I just thought it might rain."
"Oh, the weather? I guess it'll just be a drizzle. We have to go patrol at night, so it'll be a pain if it rains too much."

...Hm.
It seems Tohsaka has already made plans for us to go on patrol tonight.
I don't mind, but I'd like to go by my house and check on Sakura before that.

"Tohsaka, about that..."
"I know. I'll train you as your cooperator, so prepare yourself. I'll make you a proper magus."

With those confident words, Tohsaka sets off down the hill.
...Crap.
I can't bring up the subject of going home early if she smiles like that.

We make the long walk up the hill south of the intersection.
This residential area is filled with Western-style houses.
Tohsaka's house is at the top of this hill, past Sakura's.

"Wow"
So this is Tohsaka's place.
Sakura's house is bigger, but this house feels more like a Western mansion.

...And it somehow feels cold.
There's been an air that seems to reject anyone nearing this place ever since we finished climbing up the hill.

"Why did you stop? This is my house."
"YYeah, I know. I was just coerced."

"...Yeah. My house is different from yours. It's just that even someone who's ignorant of magical energy like you can feel the coldness of this house."
Tohsaka goes into her home, speaking in bored tones.

"Hey, come on. I don't have any traps set up, so you don't need to hesitate."
She beckons me from the entrance.

"......No. It's not because of the atmosphere that I'm hesitating."
Muttering to myself, I gather my composure and go in.

...This place certainly does have a cold atmosphere, but that's nothing.
She has no idea what a big deal it is for a guy to come over to Tohsaka Rin's house.
...Well, I'm sure she won't understand even if I explain it to her. If I'm lucky, she'll just laugh.

Wait.

"W-Why are we in your room and not the living room!"

With an utter lack of concern, she shows me through the living room and into her bedroom.

"It's because this place has more instruments ready.
 The living room is where you have tea, but we didn't come here to drink tea, right?"
"Uhum. You're... right, but..."
Um, I wish she'd think of me as a boy her age.

"...? Just sit down wherever. I'll be using sage and cards to consecrate you, but tell me now if you don't like either."

Tohsaka opens the box by her bed.
It looks like a treasure chest from an adventure movie.

"Hmm... Kishua's agate is useless for this. ...Oh, I'm out of sage. Can you bring some up from downstairs, Archer?"
"Scarlet sage, right? ...Well, I don't think you'll need to go that far to distinguish this man."

"I'll do whatever I please. You can rest downstairs after that. We have a pact, so you don't need to protect me."
"You're right. I doubt he has the nerve to betray you. I shall get ready for tonight."

That must be Archer.
His presence must be thin when in spirit form. I didn't feel much magical energy from him.

"...I'm surprised. I didn't notice that he was in the room."
"That's how it is if he's in spirit form.
 Even if he takes form, his magical energy won't leak outside as long as he's in this house. It's elementary for a workshop to shut in the magical energy."

"Oh. So is it the same for Makiri... no, Matou's place?"
"Yes. But that place has no need to hide magical energy anymore. If they are hiding magical energy, it'd be the energy leaking out from the magus himself and not from the house."

"Well, either way, it takes nothing to hide magical energy. I'd take Archer with me to school too, but I'm resting him during the day since he's not up to par."

Tohsaka rummages through the treasure chest with a difficult expression.
...It seems she can't find what she wants. Is she the kind of person that never keeps anything in order?

"...Really, why doesn't the wound he received from Saber heal when all other wounds can be healed easily? I'm sure they had some connection... Geez, why am I finding my master's jewels now? I can never find them when I want them, dammit!"

She leans forward and keeps fumbling around.
...That chest looks small, but it seems big enough to be able to fit Tohsaka inside.

"Man."
There's nothing to prepare for.
All I can do is pray that she'll find the thing she wants, or just look around her room aimlessly

"......?"
Then.
I see something.

It's a photo.
A bookshelf that's about waist-high is at the corner of the room.
On it is a photo that looks to have been forgotten.
Dust falls off of it when I pick it up, and I can tell it has been left alone for a long time

"...It's not that she never cleans. Just this picture is undisturbed."
Does Tohsaka not like seeing herself as a kid?
...No, if that were all, she could just put it away. Maybe it's important to her, but she doesn't want to touch it...

"......But..."
People sure can change.
Tohsaka looks like she's five or six years old, and she's really cute in the picture.

"...So she had long hair back then, too.... Huh?"
The girl in the picture looks just like she is now, except younger.
That's why I notice the one thing that's different.

"Thanks for waiting, I'm all ready now. There'll be a little pain, but it's nothing you should be worried about... Huh, what's going on, Emiya-kun?"

"Oh. This, Tohsaka."
I show her the picture I found.

"Oh, that's an old photo. I just put that in the corner, but is something wrong with it?"
"Huh... Well, there's nothing wrong, but..."

It's nothing much, so I hesitate.
It's nothing I need to ask about, but it just caught my attention.

"Oh. I see, you want to say I have a different ribbon on, right?"

I nod.

"That's natural. I'm a girl, so I have lots of ribbons. Even if it's my favorite, do you think I'd keep the same ribbon for over ten years?"

Oh.
She's right now that she mentions it.
It's just an ordinary ribbon.  Why was I so concerned about it?

"I'm kidding. That's what I want to say, but ribbons are special. It's the last resort for female magi. It's an appropriate magical item, so there aren't many substitutes for it."
"...Wow. Then is that ribbon some sort of a magical item?"

"Yes. Holding the hair in place means holding the magical energy in place. My family doesn't have mystic eyes, so we have to at least keep our reserve magical energy from our hair.
 It's something that controls your body, so it's best if you make it yourself, right?"

"That's the first ribbon I made. It was my favorite, but I parted with it for various reasons.
 ...Well, let's stop with the idle talk. I'm starting the consecration, so sit down in that chair"
"I'm not prepared for such a thing. I came back for Sakura.
 If you're going to kill her, then I'll stop you."
"!"

"Then what are you going to do...!?
 Look, Sakura can't live unless she fights as a Master.
 She has to absorb other people's magical energy to survive...!
 Don't you see how this will end!?  Killing her here is for her own good...!"

"...No way! Why are you jumping to conclusions when she hasn't done anything yet!"

"How could I not? If this were just about Sakura, there'd be hope. But it's not, is it? That damn old man holds her life, and she's his puppet as long as he lives.
 Do you think he's ever going to let her go?"
"That's..."

"See, you understand. Zouken will never give her a moment's peace. ...Then... If she's going to go through endless torment with no hope of escape, all we can do is kill her here and minimize the number of victims. Sakura and all the people Sakura will kill would be saved."

"Unlike you, I can't endanger everyone while clinging to a forlorn hope. The weakness to delay your decision is going to hurt her even more."


Tohsaka's right.
It's not that death itself is salvation, but if our goal is to save people, her solution is the best.
Any other idea would just be a selfish mistake.

Ten people will die if we don't do anything.
But if we can save nine by sacrificing one, then
That's...
The reality I have always tried to deny, but have known deep within my heart to be true.

"No. You're mistaken."
"Emiya... kun?"
"I won't let there be any victims.
 You're the weak one, jumping to conclusions before even trying."

"D-Don't kid me...! Do you know what that means!? Save Sakura? What does that mean!? Are you going to save both her and the people she's going to kill!? Don't make me laugh! You can't do such a thing alone...!"

"No, I can't. But I'm going to protect Sakura. I'll think about what the result may be starting now."

"! I see, then you're my enemy.
 ...Let go of me. Or you're going to be blown away."
"Go ahead. But Tohsaka, don't think everything will go your way."

...Our hands tighten on each other.
Mine is from tension.
Tohsaka's iswell, I want to believe hers is because of tension too.
It's give-and-take, but we can't back down because we both have things we believe in and

"What the...!?"
"What...!?"
Outside the chapel.
We hear the sound from the next room and exchange looks.

"Did you hear that, Emiya-kun...?"
"A window broke. And after that..."

"Running footsteps. The only ways out of here are through this chapel or the back door. What is she doing, breaking the window to go outside?
 ...Oh, I see. Most windows here have fixed fittings.
 She had to break it to get out. For someone who's still recovering, she's pretty violent."

"Recoveringdo you mean Sakura!?"
"Who else? From the room she was in, you can somehow hear everything said in the chapel. I am sure she fled when she heard you discuss killing her."

"Wha-"
"Forgive me. It is a structural defect."
"Don't lie, you fake priest...! I'm sure it's intentional!"

Tohsaka shakes off my hand and starts running.
She runs not to the room, but to the door leading outside.

"Tohsaka!"
"We'll talk later! Finding Sakura comes first! Geez, where is she going to go in her condition...!?"
She quickly opens the door and runs outside.
Tohsaka goes into the rain without an umbrella.

"!"
I don't have any time to lose either.
I don't know where Sakura went, but she can't be left by herself now!

"Wait.  I do not mind if you plan to search for Matou Sakura, but there is something I forgot to tell you."
"What? I don't have time for one of your long speeches...!"
"Do not say that. This is important. I will be troubled if I do not tell you. Rin ran off without listening to me, so I need to tell somebody. Do I not?"

"...Is this about Sakura?"
"Yes. She does not have long to live.
 The crest worm continues to corrupt her body as we speak.
 It is easy to extract it, but her body would never withstand the shock. It's like pulling out four-tenths of her nerves. She would die as a human being before the pain caused her to die of shock."

"But leaving her alone will lead to the same result.
 The loss of magical energy is slowly eroding her sanity. Soon she will lose all sense of self. Once that happens, she will be nothing more than a rampaging Master.
 She will sacrifice many people to maintain her Servant, and when the strain becomes too much to bear, she will self-destruct.
 In short, you cannot save that woman, no matter what you do."


I feel dizzy, as though I'm looking into a strobe lamp.

"Broken things do not repair themselves, and lost things never return. If you wanted to save her, you should have done so eleven years ago.
 Do you still intend to save her, Emiya Shirou?
 She will die in the next few days no matter what we do. Is there a meaning in saving such a person?"


I can't breathe.
I can barely stand under the impact of his words.

"...I don't know anything about that. But you saved Sakura. Isn't that reason enough?"
"Well. I only treated her out of duty. I cannot turn away someone who came seeking help."

"Don't lie. You wouldn't use up your Magic Crest just out of duty. I don't know why, but you wanted to save Sakura.
 You didn't want to let her die. I feel the same way too."
I glare at the priest.
...He must understand, because he nods slightly.

"Yes. Then hurry. Rin will surely kill Matou Sakura if she finds her first. Provide that lost child with shelter before that happens."
He doesn't need to tell me.
Turning my back to him, I follow Tohsaka into the rain.

My breath is white.
Under the cold winter rain, my breath seems to freeze and blow back against my face.

"Sakura."
There's no one on the road.
The street lamps light up the night in vain, and I run without aim.
...I'm going to find Sakura.
It's not just the premonition that something terrible is going to happen if I don't find her quickly.
I just want to hold her hand right now and feel her warmth.

"HaaHaa, ha"
I run blindly.
I don't know where she went.
...Sakura no longer has any place to go.
There's no place for her at my house nor at the Matou household. She has to be wandering in the night.

"...She shouldn't have gone far.  If you needed to find shelter where there weren't any people"
It's a wild guess.
But the only thing I can do right now is to check every one of the possibilities

"Ha, haa, haah."
I cross the bridge.
Sakura wasn't around the Shinto station, and I didn't hear anything about a girl like Sakura being there.

Even though it's night, it's not so late that places will be deserted.
There weren't many, but I saw a few people walking about.
But if none of them saw Sakura, maybe she avoided Shinto and went back to Miyama City.

She's probably still in her school uniform, so she would stand out in this rain.
If she wanted to avoid attention, she would head to Miyama Cityand that's what I'm thinking as I run through the rain, when...

"Sakura."
I come to a stop.
Under the bridge.
Sakura is standing alone on the dark, desolate, brick road.

I go down to the park.
...Does she notice me?
Sakura is looking down while exposing her body to the rain.

...I can't think of anything to say to her.
All I can do is take her home.

"Sakura."
I call out to her as I approach.
"No, please don't come...!"
And...
Sakura refuses with desperateness I've never seen before.


I stop.
Sakura is still looking down, tightly clutching her skirt in her hands.
She looks like a criminal mortified by her actions.  It's heart-breaking.
...I can't go any closer.
I feel that I shouldn't until she raises her head.

"Sakura."
"...Please go home.
 If you come near me right nowI don't know what I'll do."

Her voice is shaking.
She's trembling because of the cold rain and her feelings of guilt.
...I can't erase them from her.
All I can do is...
"Let's go home. You haven't recovered from your cold yet, right?"
...Extend my hands.

"...Senpai."
Sakura's wet hair sways.
Sakura bites her lips.
"I can't go. Where can I go back to now?"
Her voice is heavy with self-loathing.

"Sakura."
"It's fine, Senpai. You don't need to force yourself to care for me."

"...Because you know already, right? You heard what I am. You heard what's going on with my body, didn't you? Thenthis is..."
...All over.
Her white breath tells me the end of her sentence.

"Don't say such a stupid thing. What I heard is unimportant. The only Sakura I know is the one I've been with.
 So why does it have to end because of something like this?"

"...Because it will end.
 I'm not a virgin, Senpai. I was raped at the place I was adopted as a kid, and my first time was a long time ago. Not only that, my body has been continuously violated by unknown things."

Sakura's nails dig into her elbow.
...It's a masochistic action as if punishing the dirty stains on her body.


"That's not the only thing. I'm a magus of the Matou family, and I've been hiding that fact from you.
 ...I didn't tell you when I became a Master, and I pretended not to know anything when you brought Saber-san over.
 Don't you see? It would've been so much more convenient.  And you wouldn't get mad at me that way, right?"

"Sakura."

"But I'm really stupid. I shouldn't be able to deceive you, but I thought I could.
 I thought it's fine even if my grandfather's worm is in me. I thought I wouldn't lose if I held myself firm, but I easily lost.
 ...The stuff that was splashed on me was just aphrodisiac. It's not poison or anything, but it makes my body more sensitive. That's all it took to make me go crazy and hurt you."

"...Tohsaka-Senpai is right. I'm a coward, I'm a crybaby, I'm selfish... I knew this was going to happen, but I couldn't disobey my grandfather or end it myself.
 I didn't want to be hurt or scared, and I value myself more than others, so I couldn't find the courage to kill myself...!"

...She's crying.
Sakura is crying.
She's crying and doesn't know what to do, which just makes her cry even harder.


Feeling her pain, I regret what I've done.
I have never seen her cry before.
The reason behind those tears...
Why didn't I realize sooner that she can only cry when condemning herself?

"Don't crySakura."

"You seeeverything is my fault.
 I'm just a puppet for my grandfather, and I could go crazy any minute now. Sooner or later I'll do something terrible. So where can such a person go, Senpai...!?"

Sakura corners herself.
...Nobody is condemning her.
That's why she has to do so herself.
She has to say she's the evil one. She has to condemn herself and punish herself.

"So, don't cry."

...Sakura once said it.
That she's a coward who needs someone to lead her by force.
I finally understand what she meant.

Someone I want to protect.
Someone important to me.
Someone I never thought I would lose.
If I don't want her to cry anymore...
I have to take her hand and lead her to a place in the sun, so I should now

"...I'm sorry, Senpai. I've been deceiving you all this time.
 I never really believed I deserved to be with you. Every day I thought about ending it all... just acting like a stranger from that day on.
 I'd just pass by you in the hallway, ignore you after school, go home alone at night, and forget everything that happened...!"

Oh.
If she'd done that, I would've gone crazy.
I'm sorry I didn't realize that.

"But I couldn't...! My body would tremble at the pure thought of it, and it was really frightening. It was scarier than the time I put a knife on my wrist, and I couldn't stop myself from going to your house. I was scared of deceiving you, scared to stop deceiving you, and everything around me was scary. I couldn't move at all, and I didn't know what to do...!"

But I believe this is for the best.
Sakura says I should never have learned about this.
But if that were the case, she would just have kept on crying.

"...I'm stupid, right? You would've eventually found out. But it's too late now, and I can never go back to your house. I thought every night that I should get away from you before it happened.
 It's for your own good, and I knew I would stop crying at night, but"

I can't let her cry anymore.
If Sakura has to blame herself because nobody will blame her...

"ButBut I still wanted to hide it from you...!
 I wanted to protect my time with you...!
 That was the only meaningful thing for me, so why...!"

Even if nobody would forgive her, I would keep forgiving her in her place.

"Oh"
I embrace her cold body.

...My arms are terribly unreliable.
I can't hold her tightly, nor can I pull her close.
...I can't save Sakura.
I want her to be with me, and I can only stay by her side.

...Awkwardly, I wrap my arms around her.
Even if this is all I can do right now, my determination is definite and firm.

"Senpai, I"
"Don't cry. I understand you're a bad person now."


She gasps.
Sakura is confused, torn between guilt and regret.
To deny those feelings, I tell her what I truly feel.

"So I'll protect you. No matter what happens, even if you try to kill yourselfI'll protect you, Sakura."
"Sen... pai."
"I promise. I'll be your superhero."

...I hold her a bit tighter.
Even if it's just a touch, I do so to tell her that my oath is more firm than anything.

"......"
How much effect did it have?
The stubbornness flows out of Sakura, and her shoulders relax.

...No matter what she says, Sakura is still the same.
Her sensation and her warmth are the same.
Our breaths are white, and the pouring rain has turned to a drizzle.

In the freezing night...
"No, SenpaiI'll probably end up hurting you."
Her words sound like a confession.


The rain is stopping.
The night is cold as midwinter, and Sakura doesn't try to free herself from my arms.
...And...
"I'm going to hurt you, Senpai, but"

I want to stay like this.
A tear trickles down her cheek as she says it.

And with that, the choice is made.
Something decisive has ended.

I don't know if this is love or not.
Buta premonition lingers in the back of my mind...
Telling me that the end of this love will not be compensation.
The rain has completely stopped by the time we return to my house.
...We've been holding hands ever since we left the park.
We calmed down as we walked, and by the time we got to the hill, we were actually embarrassed, but in the end we didn't let go even for a moment.

"Huh......? The light at the door is on. Did you come back here, Sakura?"
"...Um, I don't think it's me. It might be Fujimura-Sensei."

"Oh yeah."
We go to the door, hand in hand.
Her cold hand has become warm.
I'm relieved to feel the warmth of her life, and I enter my house as if I've just come home from school.

"Welcome home. I know it was rude, but I came in without your permission."

"T-Tohsaka"
"Nee...... Tohsaka-Senpai."

"Yes. I guessed you would come back here eventually, but I didn't think it was going to be both of you. ...Well, I thought it might be possible in your case."

"!"
I quickly push Sakura behind me and confront Tohsaka.

"Tohsaka, you still...!"
"Of course. I can't leave Matou Sakura alone as a magus of Tohsaka. The Association will be after me if I don't punish her as the supervisor of Fuyuki. It'll be too late then."

"I don't care about your circumstances. Sakura hasn't done anything yet. If you still want to do something to her, you'll have to silence me first."
"You're right. You're a free magus that doesn't belong to the Association, so it might be good to discipline you here.
 I'm going to kill Sakura. I'll kill you too if you get in my way."

"......"
My senses become alert.
...Tohsaka's fingertip.
Once it moves, that'll signal the start of the battle.

I'll escape outside with Sakura before Tohsaka can finish her spell.
After thatI'll decide what to do after that on the spot.
For now, I'm going to concentrate on getting away from here.
The difference in our skills.
I can't even spare to think about what I might do against Archer, who should be here.


Tohsaka's lips start to move.
When I notice she's merely speaking, not casting a spell...
"Stop, please stop, Nee-san...!"
...Sakura jumps in between us.

"Sakura."
"S-Senpai's right. So far, he's the only one I've hurt. So if he's forgiven me, I shouldn't be punished yet."

"Hey now. Do you really understand the state your body is in?
 How can you say that?"
"...I can say it. I'm still fine.
 Are you serious, Tohsaka-Senpai? Senpai isn't a Master anymore. Saber-san's gone, and he's just my Senpai now, but you're saying you're going to kill him?

"Of course. It doesn't matter whether or not he's armed.  If he's planning to get in my way, I'll have to dispose of him."

"Then. If you're still going to fight Senpai, I'm going to fight you. I won't lose to you as Rider's Master."
Sakura is trembling, but she confronts Tohsaka with the utmost courage.


...Is she surprised by Sakura's determination, or does she think it's disadvantageous to fight here?
"I see. If you can say something like that, then fight on and win the war as a Master. Come to think of it, there is one way that you could be saved.
 You would easily be able to disenchant Zouken's bindings if you obtained the Holy Grail."

"Oh... Tohsaka-Senpai."
"It's not that I'm letting you go.
 ...We'll have our chance to fight as Masters. I'm just saying this isn't the appropriate place."

She passes by us.
To my surprise, she doesn't show any enmity as she passes by.

"Tohsaka."
"......Hmph. So our alliance only lasted a day, huh? We can't cooperate as long as you're protecting Sakura."


"But don't forget. We don't know when Sakura might run wild.
 It's your own fault if you die when that happens, but since you took her in, you'd better make sure you're the only victim."
She leaves without turning around.

"...Senpai. Um, I..."
"Don't look so worried, you idiot. That's her way of being ironic. It's her hobby to make fun of people."
"......"

I do my best to cheer Sakura up as we go into the hallway.
We're both freezing, so we should quickly get changed and warm ourselves up.

'...Since you took her in, you'd better make sure you're the only victim.'

That means that when she kills me, I have to kill her as well.
Tohsaka left, leaving me with what I must do at the very least.

...That will never happen.
I keep convincing myself as we head to the living room.

...Our clasped hands are really warm.
Sakura is here, alive.
That's all I care about now.
I can't make Sakura uneasy by worrying about other things, but...

"...Hm?"
Wait.
I think Sakura's hand is too warm.

"Sakura. Did your cold get worse again?"
"Huh...? U-Um, how is it? Do I feel hot?"
She must not know herself, as she asks me a strange question.

"No, it's not terribly hot, but you're warmer than me. It feels warm when I touch you."
"Ohi-it's probably a cold...! I think I caught a cold because I was in the rain for so long."
...?
I don't know why, but Sakura lowers her head in embarrassment.

"I see, you're right. Then you have to hurry and get changed and warm your body up. I'll cook dinner, so you go check your temperature, and if it's high, you're to come back to the living room wearing something warm. I'll make sure to cook something that's easy to eat."

"Oh... N-No, I don't need dinner. Um, I'm going to bed, so you can rest as well...!"
Sakura leaves in a hurry.

"...?"
Oh well.
I'll catch a cold too if I stand here like this, so I should take a bath and warm myself up.
I finish taking the bath and return to my room.
Now that I've changed out of my wet clothes, I finally feel like I'm home again.

"Phew."
I sit down and let out a sigh while relaxing my shoulders.
...Today was a long day.
Many things happened, and there were many ups and downs.
I sort out the things I've lost from those I still have.

"...Right. Sakura is Rider's Master."
It seems Sakura had given her right to Shinji, but she is Rider's Master now.
Then Rider must be nearby, protecting Sakura.

"...Yeah. I've seen Rider a few times already.
 If she'll be protecting Sakura, I have to go introduce myself to her properly."

...She's unapproachable because of her appearance, but I think she's understanding.
I don't know when Sakura will be attacked by Zouken, so Rider is the only one I can rely on.

...Well, according to Kotomine, Sakura's condition will get worse the more she uses her Servant, so relying on Rider is a last resort.

"All right. I'll have Sakura introduce me to her tomorrow.
 Oh... but she might hold a grudge after losing to Saber."
My shoulders slump.
...But Rider will be living here too, so I should at least greet her

"Who is it!?"
"......!"
I raise myself so that I can jump back instantly and glare at the shouji.
...Outside the room.
...I can see the silhouette of someone standing on the porch.


...There's no reply.
The figure seems to be waiting for my reaction.


...Damn.
There's nothing I can use as a weapon here. I guess I'll have to attack first before

"S-Senpai. Um, are you awake...?"
"Huh...? Oh, it's you, Sakura."
I sit back down.
...Man.
She should've said something. What's wrong with her?

"What's up? You can use the bath whenever you like. If you need a change, there's Fuji-Nee's clothes, right?"
"...Yes. I've already taken a bath and borrowed Fujimura-Sensei's clothes."

"...?"
Now I'm really confused.
I don't think there's anything else to ask.

"Um... Senpai. Can I come in?"
"Yeah. Why are you being so formal?"
The shouji opens.
And the person entering the room is...


Sakura, in normal clothes, acting strangely.


I hear someone gulp.
I realize that it's me and feel myself heating up.
"Uhum..."
I cover my mouth with my hand and look away.


...This is bad.
I looked away, but the urge to look at her is overwhelming.
My heart's beating rapidly, and my head is so confused that it might run away unless I keep the reins on.


In short, I'm about to go crazy.
I don't know why, but Sakura is unnaturally beautiful right now.

"......"
Sakura just stands there.
I finally realize that something else is strange.

"...Sakura? You're acting weird. How's your fever? Do you have a cold after all?"
"...No. I do have a fever, but it's not because of a cold.
 It's not because I'm sick that I'm burning up."
Sakura looks down awkwardly.

"!"
The gesture almost makes me let go of the reins.

...Sakura acted like this from time to time over the last couple of days.
I thought I'd grown used to noticing parts of her that I didn't know about, and that she's a girl my age.
But... I think this is on a different level entirely.

"...Sakura?"
"...It's no good, Senpai. I can't suppress it by myself any longer."
Sakura blushes and tries to endure the embarrassment.

"WWhat can't you suppress?"
"...It's exactly what you're thinking.
 ...The worm in me is eating my magical energy and telling me it's not enough. ...It wants more. My body started to heat up just by holding your hand and thinking it's warm."


I can hear the heat in her unsteady words.
Sakura is feeling embarrassment and something like joy from exposing her dark side.

"...You know, right, Senpai? I was trained as a magus at the Matou household. ...Grandfather tampered with my body so that he could turn a child of another bloodline into a magus of the Matou family."

"...The result is this lewd body that desires men. ...My body heats up and goes crazy unless I get semen from a magus."


...I get dizzy.
I don't know when I entered another dimension. but the room itself starts to warp and laugh.

But I'm the one who's strange.
I should be angry at Zouken, but I can only stare at Sakura's body.

"...Senpai. Why did you protect someone like me? I'm already impure. Even if I like you, I can't do anything for you.
 So why are you protecting me, going as far as making Tohsaka-SenpaiNee-san your enemy?"

Sakura's voice echoes in my head like a clanging bell.
...The reason I'm protecting Sakura.
I don't even need to think about it.
I don't even need to think about it, so I can tell her even in my current state.

"You're wrong. I didn't protect you. I just wanted to be with you.
 I need you, Sakura, and I couldn't think about being separated from you.
 So I can't give you to Tohsaka, even if she is your older sister."

"Are you saying that as family? 
Or do you see me as a woman?"

There's no way that I can see her as family now.
I've wanted Sakura by my side these past couple of daysno, for a long time. ...It's just that I can't lie to myself any longer.

"Yeah. I love you, Sakura."
I'm still entranced, but I manage to say it.
...I know it's something I shouldn't say, something I shouldn't give in to, but I can't fight against it any longer.

"Then please make love to me.
 Or elseI'll feel so uneasy that I'll go crazy."

"But Sakura..."
My voice of reason mounts one last, desperate defense.
But...
"...Senpai. Am I dirty...?"
Her words destroy every obligation in me.

", Sa..."
My tongue is not working.
Proper thoughts freeze in my brain.
Sakura's bare legs.
I try my best to look away from the spectacle that grabs a hold of my heart.

"Sa... kura"
Is my mind not the only thing frozen?
My eyes keep staring at Sakura, and my body, even the fingertips, doesn't move.

"......Senpai."
Embarrassed, Sakura trembles a bit.
The motion causes a silver droplet to stream down her legs.


The smell makes me dizzy.
I shouldn't be able to smell it, but seeing the light reflected off of it makes me feel her warmth.

"...Please look, Senpai. Please don't look away and watch my lewd body."
"!"
I can't oppose her voice.
...I know I'm disgracing Sakura the more I stare at her, but I can't avert my eyes.

The juices stream down.
Her bare vagina is more than wet enough.
The lewd juice flows out and streams down her legs.
Although she closes her thighs bashfully, she cannot contain the flow which is down to her ankles now.

The moonlight entangles with the trickling juice.
Sakura's love juice does not let go of the light it catches.
The light sparkles in between her legs.

So...
"...It's strange, right? I-It's natural for you to want to look away. ...I've been like this ever since we held hands.
 ...It does this just by being near you, and no matter how much I pleasure myself, it won't settle down. I can't take my mind off you, Senpai, and I..."
How could I ever call her dirty?

"Why? You're not dirty. You're beautiful, Sakura."
"Senpai."
Her voice flushes a bit.
She looked like she was about to collapse, but now she seems a bit more steady.

"...I'm not lying. You're so beautiful that I had to lie to myself so that I wouldn't notice.
 ...So don't condemn yourself like that. It's not your fault that your body's like that."

My heart thumps.
I talk as I try to suppress the blood from going to my crotch.
It's the last-ditch resistance brought on by my reasoning.
To that...

"Then please make love to me. ...I want you right now, Senpai."
...Sakura destroys it with a heated voice.


It's as if she whispered it by my ear.
Sakura's voice seeps down to my bones and destroys my small reasoning.
No, there's no way to fight it from the start.
No man can stay calm when faced with the naked body of the woman he loves the most.

"Sakura."
"...You don't have to move. ...I'll make you feel good."

Sakura tempts me with words like burning steel.
I understand it in my head.
I know I want Sakura.
My penis is so erect that I can't hide it anymore.
Sakura is wanting me, and Sakura's body is needing magical energymy semen.


Then there's no reason to oppose her.
I can satisfy both if I accept Sakura.
...But...
Wouldn't that keep the most important reason unclear?

"...Senpai."
Sakura's voice is coming from near me.
Sakura's body is right in front of me now.
...I can't move.
Is it because of tension or confusion?
Every part of my body is bound, and I can't stop Sakura.

Her skirt falls to the ground.
...I hears the sounds of clothes being taken off.
Sakura takes off her clothes to get naked, and I'm taking off my shirt even though I can't move by myself

"...Please, Senpai... I can't bear it any longer"
Sakura sounds like she's apologizing.
"Sa... kura."
The zipper on my pants is lowered as soon as I hear her voice.


My reasoning cracks.
My head blanks out when I see her young and vivacious body.

"Ah...... Hm....... I'm going to touch it, Senpai..."
Sakura's fingers touch my erect penis.
She handles it like a valuable object.
She entangles her white fingers around my hot and hard penis.

"Ah, s"
There's no way I can stop her.
Sakura's fingers are touching my thing.
That feels good enough to make me moan.
No matter how much my useless mind tells me to stop, my body is already tempted by Sakura.

"...I'm sorry, Senpai... I know you don't like this, but"
Sakura turns around and slowly lowers her waist.
Hot juice drips down onto my crotch.

"Haa... Hmm... Yours is so hard..."
...The love juice flowing out of her wets my manhood like honey.

"Mm... We have to make sure it's wet..."
Sakura grabs my shaft as if to soak her honey onto my shaft.

"Hold, on"
Her fingers stimulate my body, and I feel something sticky between us.
I'm about to fall from just this, but Sakura is...
"Haa... Hm, mm... Ah, I can, right, Senpai?"
She sighs painfully as if she cannot wait any longer.
And she pushes the head of my penis onto her crevice.

"Ahh... ah, mm, fu..."
"......!"
A slight shock runs through my back.
My erect head enters Sakura with a sound.
Her wet vagina accepts the hard foreign body without resistance.

A wet sound.
The tip, which should be too big to enter Sakura's small hole, easily pushes in between her walls and plunges deeper in.

"Hah, ah...!?"
I don't understand.
Just putting the tip in feels so good that I'm going to go crazy...!

"Hold... on, Sakura......!"
I quickly pull my hips back.
But my body is still numb.
Sakura doesn't listen to me.

"Mm... ha, it's big... butah, haa... It's coming... in"
She breathes with her shoulders and slowly lowers herself.

"Ah......!"
The sound.
I can't bear the sound of me tearing Sakura apart.

"Ah, mm...! Ah, fua, ahhm... Sen... paiSenpai's touching... me..."
Sakura's crevice.
The red part has accepted the tip of it already.
The walls roll up as my penis is pushed in, and at the same time, they try to accept the penetrating object and guide it deeper inside.

"...Haa... Haa, haa, ah..."
It's tight, but not, at the same time.
Sakura's slit and my penis melt and join into each other.
And from behind her too.
We're in such a position, but Sakura's the only one moving.

"Ha"
It feels so good that I want to vomit.
A woman's back is before my very eyes.
Her big butt is squashed in front of me.
I'm piercing Sakura from behind.
It makes me imagine that I'm inserting it in her butt instead of her pussy, and it's all the more unbearable.

"Ah, ah."
"Ha, aha... It's getting bigger, Senpai... Does it feel good...? Mm... aha, ah! ...Ah... It feels good for me too"

I'm scared.
I bear the welling cum because I'm scared.
I grit my teeth and endure the oncoming surges of pleasure.

"Ah... Ah, no... Senpai...? Mm, ahh... um, is it painful...?"
Painful?
No way. It can't be painful when it feels this good.
I'm just scared because I can't suppress myself.

My desire is up to my throat now.
If I can move, I want to push Sakura down and pierce through her.
I'm scared of myself for wanting to fuck Sakura like mad.

"...D-Don't Sakura...! If I continue, I'll"
I'm scared that I might lose my sanity.

"Ah... Haa, hmm, mm...! ...No, I'm sorry, Senpaiah, I can't... stop myself"

"HeyI'm saying... don't...!"
There's no way she'd listen to me.
My cock is deep inside Sakura.
Sohow could she stop now?

"Haa... Mm, the big thing's coming in"
Sakura moves as she moans in an intoxicated voice.
The surge that led me inside is now trying to keep me inside.

"...!"
Her walls are pulsing.
Her thick walls grasp at my penis and softly wrap themselves around it.

"Ah, aha, hm... Can I, Senpai...? It's in, so I'll move now"
Her warm pussy has me caught.
Sakura slowly starts to move up and down.

"Ah, aha, ahh...!"
"......!"
I grit my teeth and bear it.
I will release my cum along with my mind unless I do so.

"Ahh, fua, ah, haa...!
 ...Aha... Goodit's so big."
I'm caressed with numerous fingers and tongues.
Sakura awkwardly moves up and down while squeezing her walls.
"Hah, hmm, mm, mm......!"

A sound of liquid.
Her love juice leaks out.
She's moving as if to taste my penis with her vagina.
It's a diligent service that tells me how she feels.
She's not good, but she's trying her best to please me, and that fact itself is a pleasure.

"Ah, it's touching me inside... It's coming in slowly... Haa... mm, ah...! I'm glad... I'm so happyI'm sorry, Senpai."
Her voice sounds like she's crying and intoxicated at the same time.
Sakura is apologizing, but shaking with pleasure at the same time.

"Hm... mm, fu, mm...! You can see it, right, Senpai...? I'm connected with Senpai... Mm... I'm happy... I always wanted to do this with you, Senpai...!"

...Sakura heats up and starts to move faster.
Her movements were kind, but now they're getting more intense.
She's happy.
Her movements reflect her emotion by sucking, squeezing, and entangling herself on me.

"...Sa... kura"
"Ah, haaI-I'm going to do my best...! So, you too, Senpai...!"

...My reason is melting.
Her walls expand and contract, matching her movements.
They contract when I'm going out, but they suck me in when my tip is reinserted, drawing up my urge to ejaculate.
"Haa... ah!"
It feels so good that I can't keep my mouth closed, and my saliva drips down my chin.

"Mm... Is it too strong, Senpai...? Aha, then... I'll slow down... a bit"
Her juice covers my cock while her butt moves vertically.
"!"
It's like a simple up and down movement, but it's actually a pot of meat that wriggles around from time to time to stimulates my manhood.

"Ah"
...This is hard.
I never thought it'd be this hard to keep my reasoning and suppress my urge to ejaculate.
It feels good inside Sakura.
But it feels like torture as well

"Hm... Ah, aha, mm...! ...Huh? ...I'm going slow... but I can't... stop my hipshm, ha, haa, nhaa, ahh...!"
Sakura's movement does not stop.
A shock goes through my abdomen every time her firm butt presses on it.

"Haa, guh...!"
...Her wet meat.
Her delicate walls vibrate to invite me into the deepest part of her.

"Guhah."
"Hm, nha, why!? Why am Iah, faa, hm, ah...! ...Ah... I'm sorry, SenpaiI'm sorry, Senpai...!"

Sakura apologizes, but her pussy squeezes my erect shaft even harder.
...I could ejaculate any second now.
Our genitals are wet with her juice and my pre-cum.
Sakura's pussy still has some room even after accepting me.
It expands, contracts, wraps itself around me, and squeezes me.
The varying movements are like those of an educated prostitute.

"...Haa... Haa... Hm, ahh... Amazing... Yours is amazing, Senpai"
"Sakura. Please... stop."
"...Ah... Ah, no...! ...Mm, no, I can't, Senpaiahh, mm, I can't stop myself!"

...The swirl greedily demands more.
...My reasoning is crumbling apart.
Her soft walls are like an aphrodisiac.
My penis is wet with aphrodisiac, and the pleasure is melting my brain.

"AhAh"
The overdosage of aphrodisiac causes my form to be vague.
I can only open my mouth and suppress my voice.
...I'm swallowed by pleasure.
I'm like a bug that fell into a pot of aphrodisiac.

"Guh."
My desire washes away my reason.
...This isn't just a pot of aphrodisiac.
This is a never-ending sea of pleasure.
The body accepting me right now is of the finest quality that any man would be addicted to.
That body is telling me to go crazy.
I'm telling Sakura to stop for her sake, but she isn't listening to me.
Thenthere's no need torestrain myself.

"Hm, Senpai... Senpai, please use your hips too... Mm, nha......!"

There's only a fragment of reasoning left in me.
Sakura doesn't know how I can't retreat and keeps moving her hips to pleasure me.

And...
The obscene body that wriggles like a snake...

"Haaah, ah!"
...Crushes my hindering reasoning.

"Ahhau, Senpai...!?"
I raise my hips.
I grab her butt and sink my nails into her hot body.

"! ...! Ahh... haa...!! Faa, mm, aha...! Hmha, it's amazing, Senpai, you're so rough...!"
I plunge into her without any consideration.
I'm ignoring Sakura's condition, but she just shakes her butt in delight.

"Ahmm, haa, ii...! I'm glad... More, Senpai...!"
She raises her indecent ass.
Sakura holds out her body without me ordering her.

"Fuu, nha, ah...! It's big, and thrusting me from behind, ah, hmm......!"
Sakura moans.
She arcs her back and takes the thrusting meat on all fours.

"...! Senpai, Senpai...! Senpai is so, ah, nha, mm...!!!"
I pierce her without hesitation to make up for all the time I couldn't move.
Over and over.
I violently pull back, push in, pull back, and move my penis as if to oppose the welling urge to ejaculate.

"Ya, mm, ah... Hia, ahhhhh...!!!! Senpaiah, hah, amm, ah, fua...!"
It might be painful, as Sakura's voice starts to contain some agony.

But I don't stop.
Our sex turns ferocious.
Sakura tries to accept it and raises her butt.
", Haa"
My vision, the only thing not invaded by the pleasure of Sakura, breaks with that.

Her butt is lewdly raised, exposing her excretory organ.
It squeezes tight.
It's straining as if to bear the pain, and it's closed as if to follow her pussy's example.
It is wet with my pre-cum and her love juice.

"Ahkuh."
The dirtiest place on Sakura is dirtied with our juice.
It's so lewd that I want to start laughing, and it makes me all the more crazy.

"Ahit's embarrassing, Senpai's, aha, ahh, watching my butt...!"
Our juice splatters around every time I push into her, and the juice sticks onto her butt.

"Ah, kuh"
The scene fires up my desire.
Sakura's asshole. I see the place where even Sakura cannot see, and a sense of domination assails me.

"Mm, Senpai...! It's good, it's deeper, ahh, nha, it's good, so good, ahhhh...!"

I keep thrusting.
My thrusts get stronger.
My penis is fully expanded, stirring up Sakura's vagina.
She accepts it painfully.
"It's painfulah, move more, Senpaiplease go harder and squash my butt...!"

And Sakura's walls change as if to match my sexual desire.

"Ha, you!"
The waves of pleasure that I thought were at their limit grow bigger.
My brain is filled with Sakura's sensation and is about to explode.

"Haaaha, haa, ahaa, mm......!"
She desires me without end.
But that's not only her wish, as it is also mine.

"Ah... Mm... no... I'll overflow, hmm, if you do that"
I raise my butt and thrust up.
"Mmm, ah! Ahh, nha, haa... Ah, fuaaaaa...! Senpai, I'm going to come...!"
I don't pull back and rub my tip inside of her.

Dry sounds constantly echo through the room.
The room is stained with the sound of our moving hips, the sound of the juice splashing, and Sakura's moans.

"Haa, ahI like youI like you, I love you, Senpai...! I've loved you for so long, nha, I can't keep it in anymore...!"

"Ah, kuh!"
I keep moving, while Sakura accepts it and shakes.
The pleasure changes every second, not letting me rest.
Her walls change shape every time she arcs her back and stimulates me from different angles.
I feel faint.
My mind is constantly being stimulated and is about to escape my body.

"Fua, haa, ah, ahh, ahh...!!! More, Senpai, together, Senpai...!!!!"
"!"
I can't end easily.
If Sakura wants it, I have to answer her.

"Ahh."
And I want to savor Sakura without end.
I don't need my reasoning.
I don't care even if my mind escapes my body.
I can kick away such nuisances that keep me from being human!

Our membranes rub against each other.
My grotesque member is wet with foaming love juice.
Her contracting walls suck on my blood-congested penis.

", "
It'll end anytime.
I'll ejaculate with the next thrust if I let down my guard.
I frantically grit my teeth, wanting this pleasure to last longer.

"Ah, haa... Hm... Does it feel good, Senpai?"
", Ah"
I can't say anything.
I'll be unable to endure it if I say something.

"If it's goodplease say my namehaa... I want you... Senpai, to say my name...!"
Her pussy contracts with her voice and squeezes me.

"Sakura."
I pierce her.
She doesn't need to tell me.
My head is filled with Sakura and Sakura only.

"Sakura"
"Yes...! Senpai, Senpai...!"
Her back is covered with sweat.
My member is covered with both our juices.
Sakura's crotch is covered with something viscid and is reflecting light like something about to emerge from a pupa.

I'm melting.
My senses are so vague that I'm starting to think I'm melting.

"AhaSenpai called my name... You properly said my name when I'm so indecentnha, Senpai... Senpai, Senpai, Senpai...!!"
Sakura responds every time.
I feel a definite sensation every time she squeezes on me.

"SakuraSakura...!"
My desire gets worse.
Her lewd and meaty butt, her smooth back, her messed hair, her sweet moaning.
Everything is like a dream, and my consciousness is about to...

"NoI, I, I'm!"
It must be the same for Sakura.
The body that desired me raises itself, as if drawing on its last power.

"Ahh, ahh! ...No, I don't want this myself...! II want to feel good with you, Senpai...!"

Her pussy squeezes me with all its might.
"Guh......!"
I thrust it in as if to fight against it.
I feel pain as my impulse breaks the dam.

"Sakura, Sakura......!"
"Nha, ahhno, don't let me go, Senpai...!!!"
I release the strained power.
My restrained desire is let loose as if guided by Sakura's orgasm.

"Ahhmmmm, Senpai... is ejaculating... a lot..."
"!"
My cum ejaculates as if to shoot down her womb.

"Waithey"
Something's wrong.
I've let enough out, but it doesn't stop.

"...Ahh... Mm... Aha, ahh..."
Sakura takes in my hot impurity.
Sakura sounds satisfied and drains her strength.

"Ahkuh."
A long ejaculation I've never experienced before.
My cum fills up Sakura and flows out.
I've let out enough, but it doesn't stop ejaculating.

"Ah... aha, amazing, it's still coming in. Senpai... Senpai's hot juice... it's coming in me and flowing out"
Sakura sounds like she's in a trance.
...My consciousness fades.
I can't hear Sakura's voice.

A never-ending ejaculation.
It's more than what my testicles can generate, and it's a pleasure as if I'm ejaculating my organs out.

  I see a dream after that.

We're both tired and sleep together after having sex.
Sakura hesitated with a blush, but she nodded when I asked her if she wanted to, and came into my futon with a red face.


I'm dreaming.
I'm sleeping and was so tired that I won't wake up till tomorrow, so this has to be a dream.
That's why...
I'm still having sex with Sakura.


I'm desiring Sakura even in my dreams.
That's how exciting the sex with her was.
If it's possible, I want to embrace her and sleep together like this.
...I want to tell her that I love her.
She was filled with pleasure every time she said Senpai, and I want to respond to her affection.


I'm having sex with Sakura.
I'm having sex with her even in my dream.
I'm still having sex with her even though we've already made love like mad.

I had sex, but it wasn't enough, so I'd rather fuck her really violently so that I can really destroy her
"Oh."
What am I thinking?
That's going too far.

"Ah"
My vision wavers.
Sakura's not there.
I was holding on to Sakura, but I'm now holding something strange.

"Ha, ah......"
It's hot.
My foothold is melting.
I'm sinking into an eternal desire.
I'm literally drowning in a sea of pleasure called Sakura.

...I see a violent dream.
I see an ominous dream in a sea of hot coal tar.
Tohsaka's analysis ends rather quickly.
She lit an incense, did something like tarot fortune-telling, and asked me a few personality assessment-like questions.

And Tohsaka says...
"You don't correspond to anything. Further analysis would be useless."
...And quickly gives up diagnosing my Magic Circuit.

"Hey. Does that mean you can't tell?"
And when I ask her...

"Excuse me. I found out that you're not related to the five elements. Any more consecration is out of my expertise, so it's useless to keep going.
 I'll just see what magic you can use and figure out from there."

...That's how it is according to her.
I run through the "strengthening" magic using the clay she prepared.

It's called an ether cluster, and it's a strange object that returns to its original form no matter what happens to it. It's a good conductor of magical energy.
I strengthen it so easily that I'm afraid it won't recover, but...

"It's like shiniku, so don't worry about it. It restores its original state in a day even if you bundle it with strong magical energy."
...She says something like that.
Shiniku, by the way, is meat that never goes away, no matter how much of it you eat.

...Anyway, I keep repeating the strengthening magic on the clay.
I can't fail in front of Tohsaka, but I only succeed two out of ten times.
Activating my Magic Circuit, which was easy when I had Saber, took a lot of time and effort.

Tohsaka asks me a few questions while I cast the strengthening magic.
Whether I'm self-taught, whether I can use any other spells, how Kiritsugu taught me, and what I have the easiest time imagining.

So.
Tohsaka's expression darkens further with each answer I give, and by the end she's shut up entirely.
I don't know what she's angry about, but it's really awkward to be here if she makes a face like that.

"Tohsaka? ...Um, I know it's only a matter of course, but are you regretting cooperating with me because I'm such an amateur?"
I ask her the most likely thing.

"Huh...? Yeah, I do regret that you're an amateur, but in your case, you were taught wrong... Or should I say that I'm surprised you're still alive with the way you're doing things."
Tohsaka ponders.

"...? Heeey, Tohsaka? You lost me."
".........?"
Why is she glaring at me?

"......Fine. I guess if I'm going to correct you, we'll have to start with the fundamentals.  But let's go back to what we were talking about earlier. Is it true that the things you projected are still in your shed?"
"Yeah. Things don't normally go away unless you break them, right?"

I told her that I use projection as a breather in between strengthening magic.
It seems Tohsaka is particular about it, and told me to use projection using the clay.
She told me to make a vase. Everything started out smoothly, but in the end I still failed.

"Hmph. For now, I'll teach you how to turn your switch on and off.
 It's faster to make an actual switch in your body.  Stay over tonight. It's a drastic measure, so you'll have to stay in bed all night."

"What? You mean here?"
"What's with that face? Don't worry. I'm not going to be performing surgery on you. You'll just drink some medicine. Well, you won't be able to move for a while because it's so strong."

"Oh... Um, it's not that I don't like drastic measures..."
...I look at the clock.
It's almost five.
I didn't notice since it's cloudy today, but it's getting late.

Tohsaka is helping me as a fellow magus.
I'm worried about leaving Sakura alone in her condition, but today's an exception.
...Tohsaka's cooperating with me, so she takes precedence.

"...Hey, why the painful look?
 You don't mind taking drastic measures, right? Then just give up and accept it."

"...Yeah, I will. But let me make sure, Tohsaka. This thing will end today, right? I'll really be in trouble if I can't move tomorrow."

"...Well. I can't deny that possibility, to be honest. I can't tell how it'll turn out, and it'll take longer if your body has matured to the point where it can't be tampered with. And there's the possibility of the operation itself failing.
 Well, that's all up to your luck. How's your luck recently, Emiya-kun?"

...It's bad.
It's worse still given that the one asking me holds my fate in her hands.

"...Hold on. That's really troublesome.
 I have to go home by tomorrow."
"Huh? Your home?"

 "Yeah. Sakura's lying sick at my house, so I want to go check on her. I won't be able to rest easy while I'm lying in bed unless I'm sure she's all right."

"CrapI forgot about it."
...She's astonished.
Tohsaka stares at me, bewildered, and...
"You idiot! I wouldn't have kept you here for so long if you'd told me earlier...!"
...As if trying to get back at me, she gives an unexpected response.

"We can talk about the switch later! We can do that at your house!"
"W-What...!?"
She yells at me as she crosses the room and puts on her coat.

"Let's go. We're done with what we have to do here, and we can do the rest at your place. We'll continue as soon as you're done with nursing Sakura, so let's hurry."
"Eho-okay. That'll help me out."

"...Humph. I'll tell you now since I don't want to have to keep remembering this.
 Your nature is in projection and not strengthening.
 I don't know where you made your mistake or what your misunderstanding is, but you're a magus that belongs on the 'side that creates'."
Tohsaka walks off down the hallway.

"...?"
I tilt my head in wonder, but I follow Tohsaka and leave the Tohsaka household.
"Hold on...! Didn't you join forces with me because you couldn't save people by yourself..!?"


I stop.
Her words splash cold water onto my heated brain.

"I'm sorry. But Sakura's in danger. I know it's suicidal to go alone, but this is all I can do."

"...I thought so. But I can't readily help you as long as Shinji is holding Sakura hostage.
 But Emiya-kun. If you can manage to get Sakura back from Shinji, I can do the rest."

"You'll take care of Shinji?"
"No, I'm talking about Rider. Servants are ones who fight other Servants, right?
 I'll be hiding, so do anything you can to save Sakura. If you can manage that, I'll save you no matter what, even if you are about to die in the next second."

Tohsaka sounds like she's trying to convince herself.
...This is just going to increase the burden on her.
I'm fully aware of that. I got Tohsaka to help me, and now Tohsaka's trying to fulfill our promise.

That convinces me.
I'll rely on Tohsaka.
In return, I'm going to get Sakura back.

"All right. I'll leave the follow-up to you."
"Yeah. But that's under the condition that you're still alive to protect Sakura.
 Even Archer can't protect Sakura while fighting Rider. It's meaningless to save Sakura at the cost of your life."

The school building is deserted.
Thanks to the series of comas, the school closed early.
It's not even six o'clock, but there are no students or teachers to be seen.

"Can you tell where Shinji is, Tohsaka?"
"...Knowing him, he's probably inside. I'm sure he's waiting in familiar territory on an upper floor."
That could only be one place.
Shinji is in the classroom on the third floor.

"I'll go ahead. You come later, Tohsaka."
"...Okay. I'll go through the gate after ten minutes.
 I didn't tell you, but a boundary field's set up here. I'll be found even if I hide my presence, so keep their attention so they don't notice me."

I nod and start running.
There's hot steel in my back.
The Magic Circuit is already made.
I tell myself that my only weapon is meant to protect Sakura, not to harm my enemy.

"...!"
I stop.
On the third floor hallway are a black Servant and Shinji, holding a knife at Sakura.

"You!"
My mind explodes.
My feet start to move again.
Thenthe black Servant blocks my way.

"Stop. My Master will harm her if you take another step."
"...!"
I slide to an abrupt halt.
My mouth hurts.
I'm gritting my teeth so hard that they're screaming.

"Shinji!"
"Yo. Just like I thought, you came flying over here. I knew you would come alone if I told you to."

"!"
My cool brain boils up once again.
My head shakes so much that I almost forget about the Servant in front of me.

"...What is that?"
Why is he doing such a thing?

Sakura is Shinji's sister.
An older brother should protect his younger sister.
Family members should help each other and laugh together.
So why doesn't he understand?
     Something I couldn't protect.
Why can't he understand how Sakura must feel to have her own brother holding a knife to her!?

"Are you serious, Shinji?"
"Of course. I'm using the last trump card because I'm serious. Why are you stupid even at a time like this?"

"...!"
Before I know it, I'm running.
I can't stop until I get Sakura away from him.


But she's in my way.
Rider is blocking my way, protecting Shinji.

"...I do not understand. Why did you come here?
 In coming here, you showed you were willing to obey my Master. If you planned to fight, you should not have come alone."

"!"
...Rider's right.
...I have to calm down.
Since I obeyed Shinji, I have to think only about saving Sakura and not defeating Shinji.

"Phew."
I take a deep breath and pull myself together.

Shinji is enjoying my dismay with Sakura in his arms.
...Sakura hasn't raised her head since I arrived.
She's not unconscious.
She's standing unassisted.
Her head is down because she doesn't want to raise it.

"Shinji. Did you tell her about us?"
I glare at him, unable to hide my anger.
"Huh?"

"Oh. Oh, I see!
 Yeah, don't worry, Emiya. Since you wouldn't tell her, I told her everything! I told her we're both Masters and tried to kill each other!"

"!"
"Did you want to hide that from her? Are you stupid? Of course she'll find out! She knew you were hiding something, but she couldn't ask you because she's just your underclassman!"
"......!"

He presses the blade against Sakura's cheek.
Sakura looks away, but grits her teeth so that she won't raise her face.

"Come on, don't be reserved and ask. Emiya won't hide anything now. See, it's your wish come true!"

She doesn't reply.
With her head down...

"Hey. Why aren't you saying anything?
 I told you to ask him. I'm telling you to ask him what he thinks of you and if he hates you after finding out that you're a dirty woman of Matou!"

"Shinji!"
...Her figure looks like she's apologizing to me, and I can't contain myself anymore.

"It's fine now, right? I came here, just like I promised. Let Sakura go."
"What? I didn't promise you anything. I gave you a command.
 I just said I wouldn't do anything to Sakura if you came alone."


"Don't glare so much, Emiya. I'm not a devil. I'm glad that you want to save my sister. I'll meet your sincerity if you act accordingly. I can send Sakura home once we're done.

"I seeis that a promise, Shinji?"
"Yeah. I'll let Sakura go if you do as I say.
 This is a promise. I swear."

"All right. So, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to get on my knees and beg?"
"Nope. What's the fun in making a guy beg? I brought you here to fight. I told you we're settling our match."

...Rider takes a step forward.
There's no enmity or intent to kill.
Rider steps forward to obey her Master.

"But it's boring to just fight, right? It's not fair since I'm not a magus, and it's obvious that I'll win in a fight.
 So to be fair, I'll have her fight you."

"!"
...Heh.
Fight Rider empty-handed, huh?
That's like telling me to die.

"I won't take your life. I've told Rider to go easy on you.
 Well, I'm sure you'll be a nuisance if you keep running around after today, so I'll have her break your limbs."

...Rider is not holding her dagger.
It seems she really is going to go easy on me.

"Isn't your job easy? You just have to stand there and get hit like a dumbass.
 Oh, but don't go down too soon, okay? If you faint before I'm satisfied, I'll have Sakura take the rest."


...Rider comes closer.
Three more steps.
Then I'll be within her reach.

"...Heh. Don't resist, but don't go down easily?
 You're contradicting yourself. What do you want, Shinji?"

"Hah, that's obvious, isn't it...!?
 I just want to beat the crap out of you...!!"

Rider springs forward.

I raise both my arms in preparation for her attack.
At that instant
An impact that almost blows the bones away with it pierces my right arm.

"Guh!"
She aimed at my arm that was guarding my face.
My arm is still attached.
But it's numb and I don't feel anything.

"Haa......!"
I lace my senses as fast as possible.
I can't do anything bare-handed.
Unless I strengthen everything that can be strengthened, my limbs will be torn clean off.
I have to turn my uniform into steel and turn my body into something even stronger, or the next attack will kill me!

"!"
A tremor runs through my left arm.
The blow like a bushhammer penetrates through my strengthened uniform and tries to break my left arm.

"Haayou!"
Both my arms have been rendered useless in a mere second.
No, they do move, but I don't feel them.
I can't use my deadened arms to block her attacks.
If she takes another shot at my head now, I'll be knocked out for sure...!

Rider is merciless.
She beats me relentlessly, just as Shinji ordered.
Her movements remind me of a machine.

"Ah, guh......!"
I protect my face with arms that barely move.
From the start, I can't perceive Rider's attacks to block them accordingly.
I have to concentrate on guarding my head so that I won't get knocked unconscious.

"Kuh, guh!"
What is Rider thinking?
Even though my arms are an easy target, she ignores them.
She only hits my exposed chest and stomach.
...They are agonizing blows, but aren't as strong as the attacks that numbed my arms.

", "
...It's strange.
With the strength Rider showed at the Ryudou Temple, a single blow should be enough to tear me in half.
...Is she going easy like Shinji said?
Well, she is going easy on me by not aiming at my face, but even with that in mind, something's not right.

"!"
In short, her power is way too different.
A Servant's power is in direct proportion to the magical energy you can feel from them.

Rider was a strong Servant back at the Ryudou Temple.
But the Rider before me now is the Rider that was defeated at the park.
I don't know what happened, but if that's the case, I still have a chance to outwit Shinji!

"Gu, fu...!"
I fall forward.
Seemingly tired of using me like a punching bag, she steps forward and drives her fist into my stomach.


It's like a stake gouging into my abdomen.
...The attack is really effective.
The bruises from last night are screaming with pain.
Gastric juice fills my mouth and I almost fall down to my knees.

"What, is that it, Emiya? That's pitiful. You're in front of Sakura, so take it like a man!"
...I fall forward.


Rider steps back and watches.

Then...
"Ahh......!"
I grab Rider's arm and force myself up.

"! That's good, Emiya! You're as persistent as a roach!
 Ahaha, you're hilarious!"
Ah... guh.
Damn, that hurts. My head is spinning, even though she didn't hit me there

"But, well... This is a third-rate show. Even if we continue, it'll just be more of the same. I'm getting bored, so let's finish it off with an exciting knockout scene."

The same?
Are you stupid? What's the same about this?
We're standing in a different position now.
Hasn't he noticed that I switched positions with Rider when I pulled myself up using her arm?

"There are about five more meters. Your patience has won out."
"What...?"
I raise my head.
What did Rider just say?

"Enough resting. Start the second round, Emiya."
Rider shakes off my hand.
The black Servant resumes her attacks with the artificiality of a machine.

I'm being pushed back.
To avoid finishing me off, Rider's attacks stay clear of my vital areas.


My body is numb.
I'm bruised everywhere I got hit, and I don't feel pain anymore.
It's because the pain from within is worse than her attacks.
Rider has attacked me to destroy my body.

"Prepare yourself."
The black Servant closes the distance with an emotionless voice.

And in that moment, I am certain.
This isn't part of Shinji's plan.
Rider's decision not to go for my head, and that I can still move my body...
It's not because Shinji ordered her to go easy on me, but

"All right, you don't have to hold back anymore! Kill him, Rider!"
"...!? Nii-san, stop...!"

Rider's hair flutters as she steps in...
...and hits me in the chest with her most powerful strike yet.

"Guh"
I can't breathe.
I don't feel the ground anymore.
Her attack almost blows me unconscious even though I knew it was coming.

"Senpai...!"

I hear a scream and a delighted laugh as I fly through the air.
...Sakura's voice is close.

I fall.
Under normal circumstances, I would've hit the floor and died.
The impact of the fall doesn't matter.
It's an attack strong enough to blow a human away.
It wouldn't be surprising if the strike blew a hole in my chest.

"......Hah."
But I'm alive.
Anyone can jump back if the timing is set so perfectly.
That attack wasn't meant to kill me.
She's kept me conscious and mobile, not because of Shinji's order, butof her own free will.

"Now."
The range is perfect.
I turn my body right before I hit the ground, straighten myself instantly, 
"Huh?"
and grab the knife in front of me with my left hand.

I catch it by the blade.
I don't care about it digging into my hand because it's numb.

"W-What!?"
I raise my other arm.
Without a thought for the pain...

I punch him square in the face with my clenched fist.
"I'm not prepared for such a thing. I came back for Sakura."
"!"

"I see. I get your point.
 You're going to protect Sakura over other people, right?"
"Yeah. Don't say I'm mistaken. If you're going to kill Sakura, I'll stop you."

"Stop me? I think not. You can't even move an inch, let alone stop me. You can't interfere, no matter how badly you want to protect her."

Tohsaka's voice contains no emotion.
And...
"What......?"
...I try to react and realize that I can't even move a finger.

"Guh...!? Tohsaka, you...!"
"...You said I can't say you're mistaken. But you did make a mistake. If you wanted to follow your own path, you shouldn't have given me the right to decide."


My heart beats loudly.
No, it's not my heart, but the bind made right beside my heart.

It's nothing.
It was an ideal answer.
I'm not satisfied, but if that's what you say, that's how it'll be.

"Curse of coercion..."

"Yes. It was just horseplay, but I never thought it would come in handy like this. You can't go against me from the moment you swore absolute obedience to me.
 ...You made a contract with me instead of making a promise. Instead of being my ally, you chose to be my servant."

"Wha"
"I'm going to go kill Sakura, Emiya-kun. But don't get it wrong. You couldn't have stopped me even if you didn't have the geas.
 This is my duty. You're not at fault here."

"! Tohsaka, w"
I can't even tell her to wait.

...Tohsaka leaves.
"No waywhy?"
I still can't move.

"Damn, don't kid me! Why!?"
I struggle with all my might.
I have to free myself quickly.
I fight the binding, hoping that it's not too late.

And suddenly, I'm free once again.


My feet won't move to follow her.
Though I've been freed, I'm still frozen in place.
And then I understand.
My body stopped moving when I defied Tohsaka.
Then...
Have I been freed because there's no longer a need to hold me here?

"Sakura."
My legs give way.
Without a place to go, my mind breaks.

My vision loses light and stains the church black.
Emiya Shirou is in weightlessness.
I threw away my previous ideal to protect Sakura.
It's a new path that I can't yield to anyone.
But I've already lost the person on whom I'd depended.

The fight will continue.
The Holy Grail War will continue, and I will end the war along with Tohsaka, the one who killed Sakura.

...But that is no longer my concern.
Emiya Shirou's position has been eternally lost.
From now on, I must continue onward with neither a guide nor a goal
It seems Sakura is in critical condition.
The liquid that came out of her earring was poison, and Kotomine is purifying it now.

Tohsaka doesn't say anything.
Neither Archer nor Rider are here.
Only the two of us are in the church, waiting for Kotomine's return.

"Tohsaka."
Still sitting down, I call out to her.
"What?"
"I want to ask you something."

"......I thought so. Fine, I'll tell you. It's no use hiding it from you, and it's meaningless to do so now.
 So you want to ask about Sakura?"

I nod.
Tohsaka takes a deep breath and starts to talk in her normal tone.

"It all started quite some time ago. The Matou blood started to run thin, and their children were born with fewer and fewer Magic Circuits.
 The family is originally from another country, so I think the land of Japan didn't suit them.
 Their decline started when they started living here, and the Magic Circuit finally disappeared in this generation when Shinji was born."

"...The history of Matou ended with that.
 They should have taken an apprentice or something if they'd wanted their quest to continue.  But the Matous are a distinguished family, and to the last, they refused to take in an outsider.

"As a result, their successors had less magical energy, and it finally ran out in the end.
 ...They finally started looking for an apprentice when that happened, but no magus would come to a fallen family. Hundreds of years of Makiri history should have ended at that time."

"But they weren't people who could give up then. Shinji's father adopted a child and taught the child magic."

"So.
 I expect you wouldn't know because your family is a special case, but a family of magi hands down its secrets to only one child. They don't teach magic to any other children. Zouken said this, right?
 If there is a sibling, one is your successor, while the other is raised normally or put up for adoption."


There's no need for two successors.
In a case of siblings... no, "sisters", what would be done to the one who wasn't needed?

Some may raise her and hide from her the fact that they are a family of magi.
But that's difficult and inefficient.
If they trained their Magic Circuit over many generations, it would not be their wish to waste the excellent gene even if she is not chosen as the successor.
Then

"Tohsaka."
"Yes. I had a sister a year younger than me.
 ...The declined Matou family had no hope of someone giving them a child for adoption.
 It's only natural for them to rely on the Tohsaka family, the ones they held a pact with for a long time."

"I don't know which one of us my dad intended to make his successor. But I remained a Tohsaka, and she was taken to the Matou family.
 That was eleven years ago.
 I couldn't go see her much after that. It was an agreement made with Matou, and I couldn't readily go see the successor of the Matous."

"I see. Then you and Sakura are..."
"Real sisters. ...Well, we never called each other like that."

...I don't know how much emotion is contained in those simple words.
But that makes me understand.
Why she always asked about Sakura.
Why she didn't let Archer use his Noble Phantasm.

"...That's good. You're on Sakura's side."
A dim light shines into the gloom of my mind.
...I don't know what's going to happen to Sakura, or what she's going to do from now on.
But if Tohsaka cares for Sakura, there just might be hope waiting on the ominous path ahead.

"No. I'm not her ally or anything."
But...
Tohsaka denies me as if reading my thoughts.

"Not her ally...?"
"Right. If Sakura can't be cured, I'll dispose of her, just like I would with any other Master gone rampant. I can't sit idly by while a magus indiscriminately attacks people. If Kirei can't treat Sakura, then I'll just have to get rid of her myself."

"WWhat are you saying...!? Sakura's your sister, isn't she!? Don't ever say something like that...!"

"Sakura is a child of the Matous. She stopped being my sister eleven years ago."
"Tohsaka, you"

"...Hmph. The outcome won't change even if Sakura is my family as you say. It wouldn't change anything. In fact, that would give you even less right to interfere."
Tohsaka speaks as if it's a matter of course.

"Then you're..."
No different from Shinji.
But before I can say the worst thing possible...

"What are you doing? The operation is complete, but she is still in critical condition. If you want to make a commotion, go do so outside."
...Kotomine Kirei emerges from the back of the church.

"...Hmph. I can't tell if you two are on bad terms or in good harmony."

"Oh"
"H-Heh. You're just mistaken."

"I see. Then sit down. I shall explain the state Matou Sakura is in."



Taking our separate seats, we listen intently to the priest.

"To put it simply, there is a poison, a worm, in Matou Sakura's body. The worm is called crest worm. It is like an artificial sanshi, the three corpses. Do you recognize this name?"

...I shake my head.
Sanshia bug said to inhabit a human body that reports the person's evil deeds to the Judge of Hell.
I've heard of sanshi, but I've never heard of a crest worm.

"So you do not know. Well, it was originally just a harmless parasite.
 It's a familiar that lives off of its host's magical energy. It is of the lowest rank of familiars, as it does nothing beyond telling its master whether or not its host still lives."

"......I see. So it's like a monitoring device.
 So Zouken's monitoring Sakura with that?"
"Oh. When was it decided that Matou Zouken is the master of the crest worm?"

"I'm sorry, but I'm in no mood for your long talk. Who else but that old bastard would do something like that to Sakura?"
"I see, that is certainly true. Matou Shinji cannot use crest worms. So it can only be that vampire."

"Right? Just go ahead and tell me the result. Can Sakura be saved or not?"

"You are being hasty, Rin. You seem to understand her condition, but the boy does not. We should explain for his sake, right?"
"......!"
Tohsaka looks away awkwardly.
Judging by her expression, she doesn't want me to find out.

"Well, what shall we do, Emiya Shirou? Rin says she just wants to know the result."
"......No. Please explain things in order, Kotomine."

...I'm sorry for Tohsaka.
But I can't yield to her about this. If this has to do with Sakura's life, I have to know everything about it.

"Then let me continue.
 The crest worm I explained earlier is undermining Matou Sakura's nerves.
 It must be the result of eleven years spent growing within her. The crest worm has turned into a nerve, like a Magic Circuit, and it has entangled with her own, swarming all throughout her body.
 It has transformed into her Magic Crest.  Under normal circumstances it is suspended, having no effect on Matou Sakura's body."

"But once activated, it will violate Matou Sakura's nerves and will keep moving using her magical energy.
 That's what happened earlier. The crest worm roamed through her body, absorbing her magical energy."

"Had she remained in that state for half a day, she would certainly have died.
 The crest worm would suck all of her magical energy as its power, then eat her flesh as nutrition. It means she would have her body consumed after her magical energy was sucked dry."

"If you have a Magic Crest, you should well know how painful it is.
 Even the faintest trace of a foreign substance puts a human body through discomfort, and can even be life-threatening. Having another creature entwining its nerves with your own, moving within you, would easily be enough to kill you."

"......In that regard, I'm surprised Matou Sakura was conscious until just now.
 I do not know if Matou Sakura has a strong will, or if she is just used to the crest worm's activation. We will need to ask her if we want this answered."


I hear a sound.
It's the sound of my teeth grinding.
'If you have a Magic Crest, you should well know how painful it is'?

I couldn't possibly know.
I cover myself in sweat just to insert one Magic Circuit into my body.
Sakura has it several times worse.
I couldn't even guess at her pain.

"...Hold on. You said if it's activated, right? Then the crest worm isn't usually active?"

"That is correct. The poison put on her only awakens the crest worm.
 The crest worm is only an observation device.
 It is only activated as punishment for the host, Matou Sakura, when she breaks a 'certain condition'."


Just listening to his words makes me go crazy.
I know it's not something Kotomine did, but I almost attack him for saying that.

I suppress my selfish emotion and...
"What is the condition?"
I urge him to go on and tell me the heart of the matter.

"Matou Sakura fell, and Rin tried to save her. But Rider prevented her from doing so.
 Then the condition is obvious. To abandon the battles as a Master. That should be the restriction of the crest worm."

"She has approved of the battles by entrusting Rider to Shinji. But the crest worm will torment her as she refuses it now. It has calmed down for now, but the crest worm will keep tormenting her.
 It will tell her, 'What are you doing?
 If you are truly a Master, then go kill the other Masters.
 If you cannot, I will eat you and kill you'."


My mind almost breaks down.
Just hearing about it makes sparks flash in my vision.  More than anything, I want to kill that old man.

"...That's the condition Sakura must follow?"
"It seems so. Nothing else seems likely."
"Then! Can't she just not be a Master? If she uses up her Command Spell and cancels the contract with her Servant, she won't be a Master anymore"

"I would not recommend that.
 I told you that the condition of the crest worm's activation is to abandon her duty as a Master.
 If she cancels her contract with Rider, the crest worm will consume her for sure."

"I see. So she can fight and survive, or refuse to fight and be killed by the crest worm. Those are the only options Sakura has, right?"

"Right. The crest worm will torment its host for as long as the Holy Grail War continues.
 If her condition keeps up, her body will not last long, and her mind will be destroyed. She has a Magic Crest all over her body, after all.
 You should understand how absurd that is, Rin."

"...Yeah. Even though it should be familiar with my body, I still periodically get the urge to cut off my arm.
 I'm like this with one arm, so her function as a human being should be violated if she has it all over her body.
 She's no magus, but a cluster of Magic Circuit. The human mind should be overwritten by the wave of magical energy."

"Whathen Sakura is..."
"She is in danger if her condition keeps up.
 I don't know how many more days she can last, but the crest worm will spread further with each successive day. She will die if we cannot remove it before it infects her whole body, but her body will not last that long in any case."

"The only thing I did was to purify the poison.
 The surgery to call back her lost magical energy and mind is after this, but the chance of success is very low.
 That is all.
 To sum everything up, Matou Sakura cannot be saved. Are you satisfied now, Emiya Shirou?"


There's no way I'm satisfied.
Sakura can't be saved?
That's ridiculous.
She was doing so well until yesterday, so why are things like this now...!?

"What about removing it? Can't you extract the crest worm?
 If you know it's there, you should be able to take it out, right!?"

"Extraction would be difficult. The crest worm has already integrated itself into her Magic Circuits. Even the one who implanted it wouldn't be able to extract it now.
 ...Yes. If you wanted to extract it, you would have to rely on a miracle, or the Holy Grail."

"!"
The Holy Grail.
So that's where it ends up, huh?
Sakura's only choice is to keep fighting as a Master, and the power of the Holy Grail is the only thing that can save her?

"I understand the situation now, Kirei. Let me thank you."
She bows without showing much gratitude and confronts the priest.

"But isn't this too sudden? The crest worm wasn't implanted in her yesterday. So why did she suddenly reach her limit?"

"Why do you ask that now?
 Matou Sakura's body was tampered with many years ago. The changes were so extensive that even her hair and eye colors no longer reflect her heritage. This did not start recently."

"Well, it seems it was never intended to kill her as it's doing now.
 It seems Matou Zouken did not intend to use Matou Sakura in this war. She is not adjusted to fighting. I would assume she was treated that way because unexpected conditions were met."

"Unexpected conditions, huh? ...I don't know what those are, but that means Sakura suddenly won Zouken's confidence?"

"Probably. I would assume some change occurred within her that Zouken did not expect.
 But that is only one factor. There are other reasons for her drastic change.
 She is now constantly using magical energy to maintain her Servant. If she cannot spare any for her crest worm, what will the starving worm do?"

"...I see. Regardless of the conditions, it'll drain her body to acquire the magical energy it's not getting
 But she wouldn't lose magical energy if she doesn't use Rider, so"

"Yes, she should be able to live as before, for a while.
 But I don't think the old man will let Matou Sakura do as she wishes."

"......Right. He wouldn't plant a creature like that in her otherwise.
 The worm will kill her if she doesn't fight,  and her body will also be destroyed if she fights and uses up magical energy.
 No, not only that, but Zouken can do anything he wants with Sakura because he's the one who planted the worm in her."

"He can do anything he wants with Sakura...?"
"Yes. Zouken is holding Sakura's life in his hands. So defeating Zouken is the only way to save Sakura.
 But Emiya-kun.
 You have to defeat Sakura before you can defeat Zouken. She's his puppet. I'm sure he would use her as his shield if you corner him."

"Exactly. Matou Sakura is a convenient tool for Zouken. He will control Matou Sakura as he instigated Matou Shinji.
 In fact, she is superior as a Master. She is urged on by her worm, and she will run even wilder than Matou Shinji, just like Zouken wants."
"!"

"...But I will be a bit irritated if everything goes his way.
 I will perform the surgery on Matou Sakura. I have purified her poison and anesthetized her. The healing and the extraction of the crest worm will be performed next."

"Huh...? Hey, Kirei..."
"It is hopeless, but I will do my best. I cannot simply allow Matou Sakura to die. And what sort of priest would I be if all I could do was rely on the Holy Grail?"


Tohsaka's surprise is natural.
His words are surprising even to me, and I've only known him for a short while.
...This isn't a guess, but a conviction.
Kotomine is seriously trying to save Sakura.
It might just be because he's a priest, but this is too much even for that.

"...What's going on? This is the first time I've seen you support someone like this."
"It's not just a whim. It is simply too wasteful to let her die.
 Well, I suppose it is better for the two of you to have another Master eliminated."

The priest's response is plain.
Tohsaka glares at the priest...
"I'll leave her to you. I'm going to come back when the surgery should be over."
...And leaves the church with those words.

Tohsaka leaves, and the church regains its silence.
The priest silently sees Tohsaka off, and I can't even stand up because I can't think of anything.

"What are you doing? You are of no use to me here. I want no distractions. Go kill some time until the surgery ends."
"I won't bother you. I trust you when it comes to surgeries. You helped that woman before too."

"Hah. The scale of this surgery is much greater than before.
 Matou Sakura stopped herself by shooting herself. She is suffering from autointoxication probably because she harmed you. To put it simply, she killed her own mind to stop herself since she was controlled by Zouken."

"The procedure I'm about to perform is like starting a heart that has stopped. ...Well, the crest worm has kept her body alive. If all I have to do is recover her mind, it should succeed."

"But your presence here is a liability.  If you come barging in when you hear her scream, I will certainly fail. In any case, you bear no responsibility for her sufferings. You and Matou Sakura are strangers now."

"Strangers?"
"I am telling you not to have any sympathy for her.
 There is nothing you can do. Leave, like Rin has done."

"Why? Can't I pray for her sake here if I can't do anything?"
"That is a crime. You have no right to share her pain.
 Do you not understand? I am telling you the surgery will fail if you are here. You are only a harmful enemy to Sakura right now."

"Wh"
I can't finish my sentence.
His words are heavy, and they are pointing out the crimes I didn't know I had committed.

"Matou Sakura feels some kind of guilt towards you. If you are near her, she may refuse to wake up."
"...Guilt towards me...?"

"Yes. It is more like repentance than guilt.
 She is a victim of sexual abuse. It is easy to imagine the kind of training Matou Zouken imposed on her.
 To state the fact,  Matou Sakura is not a pure virgin, but a woman who knows men."


I'm not surprised.
I know this feeling.
It's just like when I found out Sakura was a Master.
I silently accepted the truth when I saw the Command Spell on her hand.

"The girl tried to hide that fact from you, but always sought salvation.
 I don't know how long the abuse called inheritance of magic lasted."

"Butwhat do you honestly think you can do now, when you stood by her side, completely oblivious, for all that time?
 That's what I mean by you not having the right to pray here. But if you still care for Matou Sakura, leave. That's all you can do for now."


...I get up.
  It's not that he's talked me into it.
It's just thatwhat he's saying is correct.
I shouldn't be here if I really care for Sakura.
I shouldn't be allowed to care for Sakura when I can't think at all.

I turn my back to the priest and head for the door.
"Oh. I do not think I even need to mention this, but..."
I don't have the composure to turn around.
I stop, still facing the exit.

"That incident you mentioned earlier. A woman was attacked when Matou Shinji still controlled Rider. She was saved thanks to you, but she would have died under normal circumstances."


I'm pissed.
Somehow, I understand why he's bringing this up now.

"That's right. I need not mention who is at fault here. When Servants attack people, the responsibility lies on the Master."

"Are you saying Sakura's at fault?"
"Of course not. I am only talking about the responsibility. I am not talking about good and evil. In reality, that woman is alive because of you."

But...
If I made a wrong decision back then, Rider would've killed that woman.

That means
"Yes, this is about the future.
 If Matou Sakura recovers, it will be the same in the end.
 The same thing is bound to happen again even if she regains her consciousness.
 Which one will you protect then?"

We don't know when Sakura might do the same thing.


I have nothing to say to him.
I quickly make my way to the exit as if to run away from his words.

"Emiya Shirou. Do you remember why you became a Master?"

I grit my teeth and walk on.
His words are an ultimatum.

"You said you would be a superhero.
 Then make your decision.
 Will you, or will you not cast aside your own desires like Emiya Kiritsuguto protect your ideal and your belief."

I shut the door.
The door to God's house is heavy like the cross.

I'm sure I'll regret it if I lie to myself and keep going.

Where the responsibility lies, existence of good and evil.
Losing Sakura will weigh more heavily on me than either of those things.
...I don't even need to think about it.
I just want to protect Sakura, that's all.

"Yeah. It's a matter of course to protect the girl you like. Even I know that, Ilya."
"Right? I'm your ally because you're that kind of person."

Ilya smiles delightedly.

Her innocence encourages me.
...I don't know if this is the right choice or not.
But I do know I won't regret it.

"I'm sorry, Ilya. I have to get going."
"Yeah. I'll forgive you since you have that expression. Let's meet again, Shirou."
"Yeah. See ya, Ilya. And thank you."

I leave the park.
I start running to the church as if to shake off my doubts.


...My answer's determined.
I don't know how much Sakura supported me after my father died.

The girl I tried to see as just another fellow student.
I kept on deceiving myself because I wanted her to stay by my side.
But such deception will no longer work.

Emiya Shirou does not want to lose Matou Sakura.
That's all.
If I can't think things through, I'll just have to trust in the only definite feeling I have.

...But within my determination...
'If you are to protect just one person'

...I can't shake off Archer's premonitory words.

Rain starts.
The winter rain mercilessly shoots down at me as I run.
...Dragging sounds.
These sounds are familiar.
They are the sounds of crawling worms.


This place is familiar as well.
The dark, damp, secret room.
An underground mausoleum.
This green room is the first room given to her after she was adopted by the Matou family.


A lone figure stands in the center of the room.
...It may not be human, but its appearance is that of a human.
This figure called for her, commanding her to fight in Matou Shinji's place.


She was prepared for this.
At the very least, she accepted the possibility up until two days ago.
But now her determination is gone.
Once she discovered that Emiya Shirou is a Master, her will to fight left her.

She visited the Emiya household to keep watch over him.
But Emiya Shirou did not have the aptitude to become a Master, and he had no knowledge of the Holy Grail War.
That fact became clear at once. Thus, there was never a reason to keep watch over him.
She stayed as his underclassman, using the role of keeping watch over him as an excuse.

She had an optimistic view that there would be no need to fight him.
Although she knew her true identity may be revealed at some point, she never dreamed that they would end up fighting one another.
Sohow did it come to this?

"...Grandfather. Do all Masters need to be killed?"

She knows what the old man's reply is going to be.
She knows, but she can only ask.
But...
"Well. You can keep one or two as playthings, if you like. All I want is their Servants. After stealing them, you may turn the Masters into your toys or puppets."
The old man's answer is not what she expected.

"What...?"

"Do you not understand? I said there is no need to kill all the Masters. We will eliminate those that are dangerous to keep alive, but those who will not be obstacles can be spared.
 It is the wish of my cute granddaughter, so I shall be a bit flexible, even if this is our greatest desire."

Hearing his words, she lowers her guard a bit.
...The old man becomes strangely kind sometimes.
When teaching her the family's magic, he is an inhuman monster, as cruel as a beast.
But sometimes, when they are talking, he becomes just a good-natured old man.

"......"

But she cannot be deceived.
She does not know if this is a whim or a calculated act of kindness. Moreover, she knows she will end up fighting him if she agrees.
Even if she does not have to kill him, just having to fight him is bad enough.

"Is that still not enough? ...My, you are a troubling one. That cowardice will prevent you from ever obtaining what you desire. Look, this is a good opportunity. If you want something, take it by force.
 Sakura. How long do you plan to remain a mere watcher? Reach out and claim your desire. You have the power and the right."

"......"

She does not answer.
First of all, there is nothing she wants.
She admires him, but she would never expect him to accept her.

She is impure. She is not suited for him.
So someone more appropriate should stand next to him.
All she wanted was to be by his side until that time came.
It'll all be ruined if she wishes for anything more.
...Not only her...
He, too, will come to a bad end.

"...Grandfather. I cannot fight. I will give Rider to Nii-san."

She speaks with a trembling voice, prepared for re-education.
She knows what awaits her for disobeying him.
The fear of being thrown to the worms, of losing one's sensation, is something one can never get used to.
The longest she was able to keep her sanity was two hours.
She almost goes crazy, thinking that she will have to endure many times that, no, at worst until the Holy Grail War ends.

"......"

Her body trembles.
Fear of punishment makes her want to scream.
...But it is not the pain that she fears.
All she fears is...
...That when the pain becomes unbearable, she will do as he commands.

".........Hm. It cannot be helped, I suppose. I cannot force you and lose my valuable successor. I shall remain an observer as well in this war."



She gasps.
She does not know how serious he is, but he has accepted her excuse.
The trembling goes away, replaced by a warm sense of relief.

But into that defenseless mind...
"But it is a bit disappointing. Looking at all the Masters in this war, the daughter of Tohsaka is looking pretty good. The unlikely might happen if luck favors her."
...Enters the old man's disappointed voice.

"Nee-san is?"

Evil enters at that time.
She knows it intuitively.
Nee-san will certainly win. She is that kind of a person. She obtains everything she wants and passes through as if it's natural.
...Nee-san will take everything she wants without even a glance towards her, the one standing in place.
ThenNee-san will win.



Her body turns cold as ice.
...She doesn't care about that.
She's used to it.
She's used to it.
She's used to it.
She's used to such treatment.

Nee-san will take it all.
Nee-san is going to eliminate everything, the pain she went through, the bright future ahead of her, and the only person she can rely on



...The ground wavers beneath her.
The words make her dizzy and nauseous.
...Her chest is hurting.
Something unpleasant assails her.
...As if a needle is in her chest.

...It has started raining.
The chilly winter rain mercilessly beats against the gutters.


She slowly opens her eyes.
...It seems she was dreaming about what happened a few days ago.
She is sleeping on an operating table in a room made of stone.
In front of her is a black priest she has never seen before.

"You are finally awake. Do I need to explain to you what is going on, Matou Sakura?"
".........No. It's my body. I know all about it."
She answers simply.
She does not focus on him, but on the sound of the rain against the walls.

"All right. Then get changed quickly. Tohsaka Rin and Emiya Shirou are waiting in the next room. We have to explain your situation to them. You cannot run after that if you are naked, right?"
"......Are you going to let me run away?"
"That is your decision. I merely helped you. It is not for me to plan your actions for you.
 Well, it was a waste for me to save you if you die. I do want you to remain until the very end, though."

"...Why is that?"
"It is more fun that way. Tohsaka Rin and Emiya Shirou will suffer more if you live. It is delightful the more sufferers there are."
The priest turns his back after he answers.
The priest will go to the chapel now.
He does not look back at her, hugging her knees on the operating table.

"Well. Will they kill you, or will they let you live? You may wait here if you are interested in their decision. Though it does not look it, this building has a flimsy structure. For some reason, you can hear all the conversation going on in the chapel."
He smiles and leaves.

"......Senpai. What should I do?"
She embraces her knees.
The quiet weeping is drowned out by the sound of rain.
Hi, is everyone doing well?
This is the Tiger Dojo, the place to save those who fought hard in vain and died!

...Wait, the ground's shaking...

We have taken over Tiger Dojo!
Disarm yourself, Taiga!

That voice, former pupil number one...!?
Hey, what's goingwhaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?

Tiger!
Look, Taiga! This is our secret weapon!

Ready, target the Tiger Dojo!
Gunner, fire!

CHEEEEEEEEEEEST!!!!!

......Huh?

Kyaaaaaaaaaa!???

Tiger! The Tiger I got from the former ***** army has been destroyed in one blow!?

Yes! I'm surprised as well!
By the way, Private First Class Ilya! I was really surprised that you came with a tank!

Oh... Teehee. I overdid it trying to surprise you. Am I full of fun?

I'll kill you!

Osu, thank you (cry).

It's fine if you understand.

I'd usually pull this joke a bit more, but it's getting tiresome, so I'll let you become my pupil again!

 Eh, really, master?

Yup, really. There are twelve more Tiger Dojos.
I can't handle them all by myself.

Actually, I don't know what you'll come attacking with next if I let you loose.

All right! Regular role get!
But twelve more? Isn't that a lot? Does Shirou get killed by  that many times?

Yeah, he will.

The chance of Shirou's death is highest in this route.
And it's in bad taste too. In contrast to the splatter-like deaths you cause, this route is more horrifying.

Wow. The one's character is displayed.

Yeah. So you be careful in your choices, okay, Shirou?
This dead end is, um... it's because you tried to fight by yourself even though Saber-chan's gone.

That's no good, Shirou. Your opponents are all monsters, so you have to team up with a monster you can use as a shield.

I know you don't want to, but go back to the choice and ask Rin.

And be careful with the choice after that. I don't know about a man doing everything he is told to do.

That's exactly right, master! Be able to say no!

Shirou with great determination!

That's right.

Then let's meet again in the next Tiger Dojo!
The 9th day has four Tiger Dojos, so be careful in your choices!

See ya!
...Um, it's the Tiger Dojo, but... isn't it a bit strange this time?

Osu, that's not true.
It's the normal, peaceful and fun Tiger Dojo!

Uh, I feel murderous intent again... No, this isn't just my imagination. I think something bad is glaring at me.

Well, this dead end is your usual abrupt death!

Once you see Rider's eyes, you can't get away from her mystic eyes. It's smarter to go into defense rather than trying to attack.

Wait! Hold on! Something is weird, there's someone behind me! But I'm too scared to turn around and look!

Hmm, but Shirou sure does die in bizarre ways.
It's rare even in our world to die of petrification.

It's near me! The rare death is right near me!
Why do I deserve this!?

Why? It's because Sakura's the type to bear grudges.

Don't you remember saying it before, Taiga? You said Rider's Master is a twisted snake woman.

Whoa, maybe I did say something like that...

Whoa!
Heeeelp meeee, soooomeone!

Well, the Tiger Dojo is over!

You reap what you sow.
Be careful about talking behind people's backs!
...Hmm, I can't say much this time.
This is one result.

........................................................................Idiot.

Hey there, don't complain!
This Tiger Dojo is cancelled! We'll wait for you in another Tiger Dojo!
Heartless collection! The evil bill collector!

Osu! Heading straight for the underground kingdom after carelessly signing a contract!

Yeah. Man, these contracts sure are scary.
They pull your leg when it counts, even when you don't mean it.

Don't get tricked by such sales, okay, everyone?
The scariest things are always right next to you where you don't expect them.

Right, Ilya-chan!?

...? Stop it, that's embarrassing.
I don't know why, but I feel bashful if you stare at me so much.

See, isn't she scary?
So, the cause of this death is your contract with Tohsaka-san.

She makes unreasonable demands of you, but there is one thing you should not say "yes" to.
Try starting over from the beginning of day 9.

Osu! And I also hear that her affection point goes up if you go against one of her questions!

Oh, as expected from the heroine (candidate) returning from the main storyline!
You have awesome information.

Ugh... I thought we promised not to say that...

Well, this is the last Tiger Dojo in day 9.

What lies ahead is a hell filled with dead ends!
Face the battles with care!

See ya!

"Phew."
I put down the empty bowl.
But the side dishes are still untouched.
It was all I could do to finish the rice and miso soup.  I don't even want to think about eating anything else.

But it can't be helped. Forgive me, Sakura.
I want to get away from here and give myself a chance to calm down.

"...Senpai. Um, did you not like the breakfast today?"
"Ugh."
Strategic retreat, failed.
It seems I'm the only one who didn't notice that there is no escape.

"......"
I hand her the bowl silently.

"Oh, seconds!? I made a lot, so please eat up."
...I take the refilled bowl and resume breakfast.


...I guess it can't be helped. I'll prepare myself.
I'll just have to deal with the fact that I'm blushing, and I won't make excuses for looking at every move Sakura makes.

But still...
"Sakura. Isn't she a problem?"

"...? What do you mean by that, Senpai?"
She looks at me in wonder.
In other words...
It seems that the presence of Rider sitting silently next to her doesn't bother Sakura at all.

"Well, by problem..."
I take a look at Rider.
She must have realized she's out of place.
"You do not need to worry about me. Please go ahead and eat."
Her elegance is a match for Sakura's.

"Huh? Were you feeling uneasy because of her, Senpai?"
"It seems so. We fought several times, after all.
 I am sure having your bitter enemy at the table with you is uncomfortable."

"That's not true. Senpai doesn't hold a grudge against you."

...This is troubling.
I don't have a grudge against her, but she has a rank of A+ in terms of people I cannot get along with.

"...What shall I do?
 It seems he is not eating much because of me. I can leave if I am annoying him."
"I'm saying that's not true! Right, Senpai? You don't mind even if Rider's here, right?"

"......"
I'm troubled.
I'm troubled, so
"...All right. I'll be honest.
 But I want to tell you beforehand that I'm not good at flattery or pretty words, so I'd be grateful if you took that into consideration."

I stare at Rider.
I can't imagine what she's thinking, but it seems she knows I'm serious.

"I'll tell you clearly. I don't have a grudge against you. I don't have a problem with eating with you. Even though I find you hard to deal with, I do like you, Rider."
I tell her straight, fighting down my nervousness.

"Impossible. Are you not afraid of me?"

"Well, you are scary, but you're on our side now, right?
 You've saved me once, and you fought to protect Sakura at school. There's no way I can hate you. ...But like I said, it is a bit tough to deal with you."

"...I do not understand, but you do not seem to be lying. ...Let me ask again. You are not scared of me?"

"I said I am scared of you. I'm fully aware how scary a Servant you are.
 ...But you're good on the inside, and you're really similar to Sakura. So I can trust you, and I want you to keep protecting Sakura, even if you do make me a little uncomfortable."

Ugh... It feels like I'm confessing my love to her.
She might ask me again if I keep looking at her, so I'll turn away and evade the
......Wait.
Crap, what am I saying in front of Sakura...!?

"Sakura. You're mistaken. This is about if I like her or not, it has nothing to do with..."
"I don't care! Well, I now know that you're a cheater who'll fall for anyone with a pretty face!"

"Mm."
Wow.
Is this the first time I've seen her this angry?

"Wait, Sakura. Calm down. I just like Rider as a person, not a woman. You trust her too, right? It's just like that.
 First of all, you say she's beautiful, but you're more beautiful to me. Compared to you, Sakura, Rider is just..."

Wait... I-I just felt hostility from Rider...!

"Um, she's equally beautiful, so I don't think we should be comparing who is more beautiful."
...This is bad.
I feel like I'm hastening the inevitable with each word I speak.

"Let's stop. This isn't an appropriate conversation for a meal. I propose that we start talking about something else."
I raise both my hands and appeal.
You could also interpret it as surrender.

"No, we're not done yet. This is a good opportunity to learn how you truly feel."
"I agree with Sakura. This is a small matter for me, but we should make things clear."
They both lean forward.

"Senpai. Which one of us do you prefer?
 We're talking about your feelings, so you should know the answer."
Uh.

"Sakura is right. Though it is unimportant, I am curious about your answer."
Ugh.

Please tell us.
I feel my back touch the wall behind me.
There's no retreat, and I'm going to make one of them mad the instant I open my mouth.

"Uh... guh."
But the problem isn't an instantaneous one.
This problem I've encountered will continue looming over me in the future.
...Sakura and Rider.
Maybe it's just women's sense of solidarity, but they sure are alike...
...I hesitate to say it, but it's true.
We're going to be together, so I should be forthright with them now to prevent misunderstandings.

"...I'm sorry, but to be honest, I find her hard to deal with. It's not that I hate her, but I get nervous when she's around."
The air becomes heavy.
...Sakura was being considerate, but this only worsens our discord

"You need not be troubled, Sakura. His reaction is normal."
"Eh... no, you're wrong, Rider. Senpai is just not used to you for now, so..."

"I do not mind. His current reaction is preferable. He is stating the truth.
 ...Yes. It seems he cannot lie, just as you said."


I'm surprised.
Rider can smile kindly like that?

"Emiya Shirou. Let me ask you again. You hold no ill will towards me?"
"No. You make me uncomfortable, but I certainly don't hate you."

"That is fine. Please maintain that stance.
 I am Sakura's Servant. Sakura's safety is always my priority, and circumstances may require me to attack you again. It is for both our benefit to be on guard against each other."

"R-Rider...! Please stop. Senpai is important to me, so don't say it like that...!"
"...You're right. I shall withdraw my comment about attacking you.
 We shall cooperate for as long as you protect Sakura. Please give me your best regards."
Rider bows politely.


I understand her point.
I don't know when she might become my enemy again, but I feel her determination to protect Sakura.

"All right. Let's do our best."
"Yes. That should please Sakura as well. I shall stay in the shadows, so you can protect Sakura in the light."
Rider speaks plainly.
The conversation ends there, and we resume breakfast in the strange atmosphere.
...Hm.
To be honest, I can't quite figure out how to deal with her.
But I already know Rider is my ally.
The reason I can't calm down is not that Rider is here, it's that

"Aren't you going to eat, Rider? Isn't it hard for you to just sit there when we're both eating?"
Um, I feel bad because it feels like I'm forcing Rider to fast.

"I will not eat."
S-She's mad for some reason.
"Why? Servants get hungry too, don't they? Saber ate a lot, even though she didn't say much."

"She is different from us. I am not interested in how humans consume nutrition. Andyour manners do not suit me."

"Oh. You should've said so if you can't use chopsticks."
"Eh, Senpai?"
"Hold on. I'm going to go get dishes and a spoon for Rider."

"...! Yes, then I'll make an omelet. That'll be quick, right?"
"Sakura."

"It's all right. This is your first time eating, right? You're going to be doing a lot of things for me, so please let me do at least this much."
Sakura happily says this and comes into the kitchen.

"Oh, how about we make some soup while we're at it? We still have some consomme, right?"
"Oh, that sounds good. We have some tomatoes, so let's make this in a flash!"

...Sakura starts to cook for Rider.
Rider watches Sakura as she happily starts cooking.
Breakfast is over, and it's now nine o'clock.
I skipped school today.
Things are getting serious, so I have no intention of going to school until the Holy Grail War ends.

My only reason to go to school was to meet Tohsaka.
Now that the reason is gone, there's no meaning in going outside, and most of all
It's too dangerous to have Sakura go outside.

"......"
Sakura's been looking healthy enough, but we don't know when she'll collapse like she did yesterday.
Although she recovered, thanks to Kotomine's treatment, she's walking a thin line.

...I don't know what Zouken intends to do, but I can't let Sakura meet him in her unstable condition.
If the crest worm is activated, it'll all be over.

Shinji did it using a drug.
But for Zouken, the one who put the crest worm there, it should be easy to activate just by looking at her.


Kotomine said it too.
That Sakura won't last long.
That I'm the only one who knows about this.
...I can't tell Sakura or Tohsaka.
I have to end the war before Sakura finds out what I'm doing.

I don't have the power to save Sakura.
But the Holy Grail, the thing that is said to grant any wish, should easily be able to save her.

"Senpai? You're making a scary face and acting strange. We skipped school, so I think we can relax..."

"No, we should rest after the war. We have to think about how to win now."
"...Senpai. You still want to continue?"
I'm taken aback by her uneasy tone.

"......"
...I vaguely understood, but Sakura doesn't want to fight.
She should know the Holy Grail is the best way to cure her, but she's not even considering it.

...Hatred of battle.
Sakura is terrified of harming others.
She's right, and I have no intention of contradicting her.
Sakura can stay that way.
I'm the one who's made her cry all this time. Therefore, it's my job to fight for her.

"Yeah, I'm going to continue fighting. If we could talk it out, I'd do it, but we can't be saying that. I don't think Zouken will release you, and I'm sorry, but I can't give him the Holy Grail.
 ...There are four more Masters. I'm going to make you win and have you use the Holy Grail."

"...I'm happy to hear you say that. But... can you fight Tohsaka-Senpai?"
"I'll fight her if she gets in our way... Well, I really want to entrust her with something as dangerous as the Holy Grail. I'm sure she can manage it and save you as well."

"...Is... that so? She's a magus. I don't think she will think about someone as weak as me."


I can't say it's not true.
...Tohsaka is a nice person. I already know that.
But with that aside, Tohsaka is a magus.
Last night, she said she would kill Sakura.
Even though that might've been the only choice at the time, she was willing to take it.

...So.
If the Holy Grail turns out not to be able to save Sakura, she would surely use the Holy Grail, something far superior to Archer, to kill Sakura.

"...You're right. But still, Tohsaka won't be able to do it.
 She can't kill you."
"Eh...? Why do you think so, Senpai?"

"Well, I don't have any proof, but deep down she's an amazing person. I bet the future she chooses is a really happy one where nobody has to die. So it's fine.
 Tohsaka will surely save you in the end."

"...Um. So about Tohsaka-Senpai. You... um..."
"Hm?"
"...No, it's nothing. I'll believe in her if you say so."

"Yeah. Then again, it'd be a shame to put everything on her shoulders, and I don't want to just hand it to her in any case. I want to be the one protecting you."
I chose to lead Sakura's way, so I can't give that role to anyone else.
I'm going to do my best to make Sakura happy.

"...Um, Senpai. I appreciate your concern. But I don't think you're in a state to fight. Saber-san's gone, and you're enemies with Tohsaka-Senpai now.
 There's no need for you to involve yourself in the Holy Grail War. So please go back to your usual life.
 ...I don't want you getting hurt because of me."

"Idiot. That's not your fault. I'm doing it because I want to, and it's not something I can withdraw from now. You should know that too, Sakura."

I participated in this war as Saber's Master.
I didn't become a Master because I was dragged into it. I became a Master by choice.
ThenI can't withdraw now.

I'll fight, even if I have to do it alone.
I will see this conflict to its end.
...This is also my atonement for Saber, who lost her life fighting for my selfish goals.

"...Then no matter what, you will..."
"I won't stop. So I think we need to come up with a plan of action. Is that fine with you, Rider?"
"I do not mind. You are correct. What is your opinion, Sakura?"

"......"
Sakura agrees with silence.
...Good, it seems she understands.

"All right. We need a plan, but before that..."
I glance at Rider.
...I'm getting used to her presence, but I want to do something about this.

"What is it?"
"It's about your eyes. Why don't you take off your blindfold when you're in the house?
 I know about your mystic eyes, so you don't need to hide them, right?"
Isn't it uncomfortable?

"...So my beauty is being spoiled by its appearance?"
"To be frank, yes. Your clothes may be fine, but isn't it hard to keep that blindfold on? You're beautiful, so why don't you take off that sultry thing?"
"That is what he says, Master. I shall consider it, depending on what you say."

"No!
 Absolutely not!!"

"Huh?"
 ...Wait.
Why is Sakura objecting so desperately?

"Why? Doesn't it trouble you to have Rider walking around blindfolded?"

"N-not at all! First of all, she has mystic eyes. What would you do if you're affected by them on accident?"
"Hm. Would such a thing ever happen, Rider?"

"Yes. My eyes are more like evil eyes.
 It would be difficult to keep from targeting you even if I saved my magical energy."
"Whoa, are you serious? You can't control your own eyes?"

"No. Hence my title.
 ...But I cannot hope for an effect equaling yesterday. You now know that my eyes are mystic eyes of petrification. This recognition weakens the effect that a surprise attack has, so you should petrify at a slower rate."

"I see. So my body won't suddenly go numb like yesterday?"
"It would depend on the situation. The effect will be magnified if you let your guard down."

"Hm. So I just have to not let my guard down, right? Then there's no problem. Even if I'm captivated, you're on my side, so you can dispel me right away."

"Yes. I will not take your life. In that regard, there is no danger."
"No, no, I said no...! Rider's eyes aren't just to petrify others!"

"You are right. Then I shall keep them sealed."
Sakura lets out a sigh of relief.

"......?"
...Hm.
I don't really understand, but it seems Rider's going to keep her blindfold on.

"...I see. It bothers me, but if that's what you want, I'll have to deal with it."
"Yes, I do not like revealing my face. Please do not bring this up again."

Where did her previous lightheartedness go? Rider is suddenly acting cold now.
...She's hard to understand.
I guess I just can't get along with her all that well.
And she is left alone.
There is no reason for the boy to fight.
The one who is no longer a Master walks into danger while she, the danger's cause, is resting.
That fact depresses her even more.

"He has headed to the forest. Do you regret it, Sakura?"
The servant asks her master.
The girl does not nod, but narrows her eyes and shakes her head once.

"...I can't regret it, Rider. There's no point now."
"You are correct. That was certainly a meaningless question."
"Yes. But it's not all painful. I know it's wrong to say this, but I'm happy. I'm happy that Senpai's doing something for me."
But her face is filled with agony.
The mouth that says she's happy is heavy as if bound by a feeling of guilt.

"But that's wrong. Grandfather will show no mercy. As long as Senpai keeps fighting, there's a chance that he'll die.
 And most of all"
It's troubling for her if he stays in the war any longer.
It will bring a bad fate down upon them both.

That's why she wants him to simply return to his normal life.
She will not last long.
That being the case, she wants him to live.
...But...
At the same time, she clings to hope.
For as long as he fights, she can be with him.
No, it delights her that the person she loves is fighting and getting hurt for her sake.

She doesn't want him to fight.
But having him fight makes her happy.
The two contradictory wishes compete for control within her.

"...What a lie. It's not competing at all."
With a pained murmur, she acknowledges the darkness within her.
Yes.
She wants him to fight. She wants him to save her. She wants him to answer her to make up for all the times he did not.
For that reasonhe can get hurt.
And she thinks about something she shouldn't.

"Hah, kuh......!"
She clutches her chest.
As if responding to her dark passions, the worm within her stirs against her nerves.
...It was only for an instant.
She imagined him getting hurt for a mere instant, and the worm has begun to violate her once again.

Wriggle, wriggle.
Wriggle, wriggle.
Wriggle, wriggle, wriggle.
The squirming in her body makes her ears ring.
It melts into her blood, causing a chill to run through her body.
The feeling stimulates her, and she thinks her body is lewd and evil.
...The worm that melted into her blood becomes aphrodisiac, heating up her body.
The waves threaten to wash her consciousness away.
She always thinks with her heated head.

That her limbs are too dirtied to be called human limbs.
Sexual desire easily fills her body, and she clings on the ground in a vulgar manner.
Her panting does not stop, and her hips wriggle like mucus.
It is no different from the thing entangling her nerves.
The worm violates her the more she tries to deny it, her consciousness is melted away, and...
She feels like she is a worm herself.
And in the end, an ominous feeling dominates her whole body.

"Sakura."
"...It's fine. I'm still all right. More importantly, Rider. Please go with Senpai."
"...I shall obey if that is an order. But Sakura. You do not have long to live either. To use me is to shorten your remaining life. Is that fine with you?"

"...Yes. I won't last long anyway.
 I'm fine now, but I lose track of what I'm doing if I let my guard down. ...My memory becomes more vague by the day, and I can't feel anything in my limbs anymore. Even my sense of time is going, so that a day doesn't flow properly for me.
 ...Like today. It feels like it's been a week since I saw Senpai off."

She says it as if it's nothing.
...She has accepted death.
She's fighting the ugliness of clinging to hope, and she has ordered her to protect him.

"Understood. I shall obey my master and guard Emiya Shirou."
"Thank you. ...I'm sorry, Rider. If I'm no good anymore, then go make a contract with someone else. I don't want Senpai... but maybe it's okay if it's with you."
She forces a smile.
The Servant in black nods and turns her back to her master.

"...An ill wind blows. I will be using my Noble Phantasm. Is that permissible?"
"Yes. Please bring Senpai back if things turn out to be dangerous."
"I know. But Sakura.
 I believe we should be on guard against that priest over the old man."
Rider speaks without looking back.


That's a surprise for her.
This Servant does not state her opinions. She silently does as she is told.
She has never shown concern for her the way she does now.

"Yeah. I think so too."
She murmurs as if singing.
Her grief dispelled, she is now filled with languorous elegance.
"But don't worry, Rider.
 He can't beat me."
She smiles like a girl picking flowers.

...I open my eyes.
While staring up at the ceiling, I raise my arm and let it fall to the futon.

"It's a bit heavy."
I keep my eyes on the ceiling in a daze, not bothering to get up.
...My body feels dull.
I'm not awake yet, and I feel like I need more rest.
Even though it's morning already, I really don't feel like getting up.

"Hm... Why am I so tired?"
I try to recall what happened.
Then.


At the very least, my sleepiness is blown away in an instant.

"Um."
I look beside me.
No one is beside me. All I see is my lazy arm.

"Oh, so Sakura's already awake."
Then she should be in the kitchen.
Knowing her, I bet she's preparing breakfast and letting me sleep in.

"Man, she always pushes herself if I don't stop her."
I raise myself up.
Immediately, dizziness assails me.

"...Whoa. My body sure feels heavy."
Maybe I'm tired.
A lot certainly did happen yesterday, but, um... I don't think what happened last night would make me this tired.
I haven't been training for nothing.
It must be because I didn't get that much sleep.

"...I couldn't sleep really well. Well, my blood should get flowing once I start moving around."
First of all, Sakura's in a worse state.
And she's pushing herself even harder, so I can't be resting just because I feel a bit tired.

Mustering my resolve, I get out from the futon.
"Ugh."
And I get dizzy again.
It's not because of fatigue.
It's because, um, my appearance is very unique, causing me to remember what happened last night.

"......Um. I have to put some clothes on."
I drag the futon with me as I make my way to the wardrobe.
...Crap.
If this is causing me to blush, how in the hell can I greet Sakura...?

"Phew."
I take another deep breath to prepare myself.


It's all right. I've simulated it many times in my head.
It's nothing difficult. I've greeted her numerous times before, so it's weird to be nervous.

"All right, I'm going."
I put gasoline into my empty tank.
I turn the key, kick the gas pedal, and enter the living room where Sakura is.

Oh.
Then.
Sakura, who I thought would still be in the kitchen, is in the living room, putting breakfast on the table.

"Uhg-g-good morning, Senpai."
"UhYeah. G-Good morning, Sakura."
We both greet each other with tense voices.

"Um......... well."
"Uh......... um."
I try to say something, but my head is blank.



This is bad.
It's bad to have silence so early in the morning... no, more than that, as a man, I can't trouble a girl...!

"G-Good morning, Sakura...! The food sure looks good!"
I talk stupidly.
...Wait, this greeting isn't any different from the earlier one, you idiot!

"Oh, yes! G-Good morning, Senpai!"

...Um.
I think Sakura's response is the same as well.

She looks at me in surprise, evidently thinking the same thing.
To her, I must look the same way.

"Hah."
Thinking about it makes me relax.
We were both nervous, but we were looking forward to seeing each other.

"...Phew. This is the third time, but good morning, Sakura."
I give a natural smile and greet her again.
The instant she sees me relax...
"Yes. Good morning, Senpai."
Sakura returns the smile and responds for the third time.

And so our awkward breakfast starts.

"Itadakimasu."
"Yes, itadakimasu."
Even though we can do all the usual formalities, I'm still nervous.


I eat restlessly.
...Sakura must have gotten over it, as she's eating in a good mood.
...Hmm, are girls stronger in this regard?

"...? Is something wrong? Oh, do you want more miso soup?"
"No, I'm still on my first bowl. But it's good. Yeah, it's really good."
"Yes. I'm confident in today's food, so I'm glad you like it."

"!"
Her smile makes me choke.
It's embarrassing to be blushing when Sakura's already composed, so I start eating to hide it.
"Let's get back on topic. About our future course of action... First of all, you're not to go out of this house, Sakura. It's too dangerous for you to meet Zouken. I'll handle him."

"That is a proper approach. But how will you defeat that magus? Do you have any thoughts?"

...I hesitate to answer if she asks me like that.
There are several possibilities, but I haven't put any thought into them.

"That's"
...The choice will likely determine our fate.
There are many choices.
Of them all, the most realistic and reliable method would be...

"I think I should cooperate with another Master.
 She may not become our ally, but she may help us defeat Zouken if we tell her about the current situation."

"Another Master... Do you mean Tohsaka-Senpai?"
"Eh? No, it's not Tohsaka. I know Berserker's Master. Her name's Ilya, and I know she'll listen to me if I go to her and talk."

...And to be honest, I can't leave her all by herself.
Leaving Tohsaka aside, I don't know what Zouken will do.
He's the kind of guy that would implant a worm in Sakura and force her to fight.
Ilya and Berserker should be many times stronger than Zouken in combat, but we're talking about that monster. I'm sure he will use any means possible precisely because he can't beat them in combat.
So even those two should be careful.

"Berserker... You believe that mad warrior will become our ally?"
"They may not become our ally, but they should at least overlook us for a while. And even if we can't cooperate, I want to warn them at the very least."

The girl that came to this town alone.
Ilya was raised as a Master and crowned with the name Einzbern, so she's not a total stranger to me.

"...I see. But Senpai, do you know where this Ilya person is?"
"Yeah, she showed me once before. I remember the way. It's a big forest, so I don't think it'll go exactly as planned, but I should make it in half a day."

"Half a day... That means you're going to set out now?"
"Yeah. They say to strike while the iron's hot, and if I head out now, I should be back by nightfall."

I was pressed to make a decision, but this is good.
Ilya helped me yesterday, so I want to thank her for that.

...And.
It might prove fatal for her if I don't tell her about Matou Zouken and that mysterious shadow.

"I'm gonna get going. I'll come back as quickly as possible, so you rest in your room."
"Okay, Senpai. Then please, at least take Rider with you. She can protect you from anything that might happen."

"Oh, yeah. That's safer for me."
...But I can't agree to that.
Sakura is also in danger.
No, she's in greater danger because she can't oppose Zouken if she meets him.

"No, you protect Sakura, Rider.
 If Zouken comes, try to avoid battle since that uses your magical energy. Instead, carry Sakura and run away. I'm sure they can't catch up to you."

Rider nods obediently, apparently thinking the same thing.

"See, Rider's saying the same thing. You'll be staying home for today."
"......But it's dangerous for you too. That forest right now is..."
"Don't worry. I'll run away if I think it's dangerous. And Ilya isn't interested in anyone that's not a Master. It's not dangerous for me since I'm not a Master anymore."

I pat her on the shoulder and leave the living room.
Well.
I'll go to the shed first and find something I can use as a weapon.

Sakura sees me off as I go.
A shinai bag with two wooden swords inside and another bag filled with light food are the only things I'm carrying.
I didn't bring a map or a compass.
It's a route Ilya showed me with her magic. So all I can rely on is my memory and my instinct.

"...It's before ten. An hour on the taxi, and four hours on foot..."
I hope that's all the time it'll take.

I'll ask the taxi driver to go slow and find the entrance to the forest.
I'll get off the taxi when I find the entrance, and continue on foot from there.
I'll make it to Ilya's castle before sunset if I take the shortest route.
I'll figure out what to do next once I've met Ilya.

"Shirou."
"Huh?"
...Then.
I hear a familiar voice from behind me.
It sounds practical, and cold depending on how you hear it.
But my name is said politely, with as much intimacy as she can show.

"Sab..."
I almost say the name, voicing my impossible wish.
"Wait. I must speak with you before you leave."

"Ri... der."
I turn around and accept reality.
Rider is in front of me.
The girl who used to call me with that tone is no longer in this world.

"Fine, but what is it? I'm in a hurry, so please make it short."
"I only have one question. You said you will protect Sakura. But I have not heard your reasons for doing so, Emiya Shirou."

"Are you saying you can't trust me?"
"Correct. I do not know you as well as Sakura does."
"......"

That's a natural question.
Rider protects Sakura, not me.
As a potential ally, she just wants to know my intentions.

"......Phew. I'll only say this once, so don't ask me about this again. It's not that I'm putting undue importance on it. It's just not something to go around telling people."
"........."

"Look. I like Sakura. Not only that.
 I had sex with her last night."
"...It seems so. Sakura's magical energy was stable this morning. Sakura would have been sick again if she did not get outside provision.
 What of it?"

"That's all. I like Sakura, and I made love to her. That's the only reason I'm protecting her. It's natural for a man to protect his woman, right?"


"...Then you are fighting for Sakura? Your goal is to save Sakura. You have no intention of letting her obtain the Holy Grail for your benefit?"

"Well, I am planning to use it. I don't know what the Holy Grail is, but if it can bring Sakura happiness, I'm going to make full use of it."
"Bring Sakura happiness?"
"Yeah. I've made Sakura suffer until now. So I want to compensate for that by making her happy."

Rider just stands there without saying anything.
...It seems she understands why I'm embarrassed to tell people about this.

"All right. I answered your question, so it's my turn. I have a request to ask of you."
"O-Okay, I shall answer it to the best of my ability."

"It's easy. Can you not say my name with that accent you just used? Can you pronounce it properly? It's Shirou. Don't drop the 'u' and pronounce it clearly."

"...? ...I-I understand. Shirou is fine?"
"That still sounds weird. You don't have to put any unusual accents on it."
"Um, S-Shirou. Shirou. Shirou. Shirou, no, Shirou."

Rider struggles as she practices pronouncing my name.
......Yeah.
She has a sharp image because of her blindfold and her black clothing, but Rider is actually sociable.
I'm just guessing, but I think Rider is a klutz in her private life.

"Shirou. ...Hm, so is this the correct pronunciation, Shirou?"
"Yeah, it's perfect. I'm sorry I asked you a selfish request."

"Selfish...? You did not like to be called with the accent I used, right? Then I believe it is right for you to correct me."
"You're wrong. I did like the way you called me."

...That's right.
I liked it, so I don't want anyone else saying it the same way.
I know it's a stupid thing to care about, but she was the only one I wanted to hear call me like that.

"I'm sorry. It's really just something selfish. It's not that you're at fault."
"I understand. I shall not inquire about it if you say so."
"Okay, then I'm going. I'm leaving Sakura to you, Rider!"

I wave to Rider and start running.
I'll go to the intersection and catch a cab.
Then I'll go to the suburbs and look for the forest entrance that I only saw once.
A few minutes' walk from the national highway.
Even though I've never seen it in person, the forest's entrance looks familiar.  It's white like morning mist, even during the day.
The dim sunlight and fog steal the sense of time from this place.

"...Whoa. Am I really going to be fine?"
I can't believe how reckless I'm being.
I didn't get lost back then because I was watching it through Ilya, but this isn't something I can manage by memory alone.

"No, I can whine later. I'm desperate, so I just have to go tackle this."
I put spirit in myself as I put the bag over my shoulder.

It's past noon.
It takes about four hours to reach Ilya's castle from here, according to what I saw.
All I can rely on now are my physical strength, memory, and recollection skills

I walk through the forest.
The smell of sap is a bit suffocating.
The unpaved path is tiring to walk on.

It's been two hours, and I think I'm following the route Ilya showed me.
But it's worrying that there's no sign to confirm that I'm on track.

I can keep walking all day because of my training, but mental fatigue is chipping away at my energy.
If memory serves, I still have two hours to go.
I can easily imagine what'll happen if I don't end up at the castle in that time.
My physical limit is far, but I'll make trivial mistakes with a disturbed mind.

Rehydration and monitoring your condition are your highest priorities during mountain climbing, and you have to worry about which foot you step with and the depth of the bare rock you're scaling.

Even though the forest isn't as dangerous as a mountain, this place has a different kind of danger.
Losing your sense of direction, not knowing where you are...
There's the danger of getting lost, and who knows what beasts you might encounter.

The beasts living in this vast forest are likely to have their territories.
When people stray into those territories, they're usually attacked.

Walking aimlessly is like asking to be attacked, and even a straight animal trail needs to be avoided from time to time.
Fortunately, snakes don't seem to exist in this forest.
All I see are traces of wild dogs, and that's rare too.

I bet there aren't many living things here because of the magic of Einzbern on this forest.
But there are a few wild dogs, and there may be far worse things.

"Oh, that way is bad. I'll have to watch out on my way home."

I go around the thicket that an animal may be lurking in and make my way according to my memory.
Discretion is the better part of valor.
It's a rule of thumb to simply avoid dangerous places rather than waiting until the danger confronts you and then running away.

"...But still... This forest seems different from the one Ilya showed me."

...The air around me feels different.
An ominous chill runs down my back with every step.
Don't go any further.
Get out of this forest now.
Nobody will return alive from this forest today.
I feel like the swaying trees are warning me.

"Come to think of it, this smell is..."
I thought it was sap, but that's not quite right.
...The sweet smell is nothing like the forest.
This is
Probably...

"Hold on."
I take out a wooden sword from my bag.
...I stop, concentrate, and strengthen it within a few minutes.

"Something's coming."
...I hear footsteps from the other side of the thicket.
I hear sounds among the swaying branches.


...It's coming.
It comes out and heads straight for me!

I raise my wooden sword.
Tensing my arms, I grip the sword and stand ready.

"That's it, don't move!"
"All right, don't move!"
We both freeze.

"......"
"......"
............Well.
How should I handle this situation?

"...Hey. Can you lower that? This isn't a haunted house, you know?"
...Tohsaka lowers her guard first.

"Oh, sorry."
I follow her example.

"...Hmph. What a strange place to run into you.
 I guess I'd better ask, but you're not just scouting sites for a picnic, are you?"
"Of course not. What about you? You're not the type to take walks in a forest. What are you planning?"

"How rude, I do too take walks in the forest. Well, my business today is different."
She protests.
The surprising part here is that she's not denying that she's planning something.

"Tohsaka. Are you planning to fight Ilya?"
I get right to the point.

"...What if I am? You're not a Master anymore. So you don't have the right or the duty to meddle with our battles."
"I don't. But I'll stop you if you're going to fight Ilya."

"Why? Are you planning to have Ilya join forces with Sakura?"
"That's part of the reason. But you won't come out unwounded if you fight Ilya. One of you will end up hurt if you two fight. I don't like that. First of all, I..."

"You decided to fight to stop the battles, right? I see you haven't changed your mind."
Her sharp tone gone, Tohsaka shrugs in resignation.

"......Oh."
That's Tohsaka's real face that she had on before that thing happened to Sakura.

"W-What? I can't change it so easily because it's something I decided on."

"I figured as much. Geez, I've suspected this for a while now, but..."
I don't know why.
But Tohsaka gives an exaggerated sigh...
"You're really stupid, aren't you, Emiya-kun?"
...And gives a smile that surprises even me.

"Wha"
"But this is good. You never learn your lesson, but that's what I expect from you. You should do your best as a clumsy person."

"W-What's with that triumphant expression!? You piss me off!"

"Now, now. So I guess you have business with Ilya too. You're really planning to talk with her?"
I'm angry, but Tohsaka just stares at me with a smile.

"Hm"
...Damn.
I don't know why, but I can never deal with Tohsaka in these situations. I feel like I'll back myself further into a corner no matter what I say.

"...? Why are you quiet all of a sudden? It's not like you."
"......Heh. Yeah, you're exactly right. I'm going to see Ilya, so don't bother me. I'll chase you away if you come following me."

"Huh? Oh, you know where Ilyasviel lives?"
"Oh."
Crap.
Me and my big mouth.

"Good, can you lead me there?
 I know the general location, but I only have a really old map, and I can't really trust it. It's great if you know where it is."
"Hey now. I told you not to follow me."

"Oh. Can you let me be when you're going to go talk to Ilyasviel? If I find her first, she'll be too busy to talk with you."

"...! A-Are you threatening me!?
 First of all, you're going to fight her even if we go together, right!?"

"I won't. It's best if we can cooperate with her. Our priority is to kill Zouken, right? I came here to warn her."
"! Warn her about what?"

"Matou Zouken is planning something, so I'm going to warn her not to let her guard down. You remember what happened to Caster, right? It'll be to our disadvantage if the same thing happens to Berserker.
 But I was ready to fight her even though I only came to warn her. Considering us, we can't just talk.
 I thought it can't be helped if we ended up fighting after I warned her. I have to beat her eventually, so this is just a matter of time, right?"

"But you seem to have expectations. Then I don't need to take risks, and things can end peacefully depending on your efforts."


"Hey, don't make a difficult expression! I'll go back without doing anything if you can persuade Ilyasviel.
 But if you fail, we can beat her together or I'll help so that we can both escape. How about it? It's not a bad deal, right?"

"...Deal or not, you're going to follow me anyway, right?"
"Of course not, that's a false accusation. We just happen to be heading in the same direction."

"......"
She's a devil.
But she'll listen to me, so long as I'm guiding her.
Tohsaka will go fight Ilya if I leave her be, but she'll stay quiet if I take her with me.

"I'm not too sure about the way either, okay?
 Don't complain if we get lost."
"You don't need to worry. You're heading exactly the way my map says. We won't get lost with your guide and my map."


I sigh loudly, making sure Tohsaka can hear it.

"All right, I give up. Let's go to the castle together. You won't fight Ilya, right?"
"Right, I won't interfere while you're talking with her. She's troublesome if she's your enemy, but she's reliable if she's"

"An earthquake...!?"
The trees shake.
I hear explosions in the distance.
...No.
This isn't an earthquake. Something like a typhoon is raging nearby

"Tohsaka, this is...!"
"Berserker. I guess we were a bit too late."

"Wha... Then Berserker's the one raging around!?"
"Yes. We're here, so there's only one person Berserker would be fighting against. ...What will you do? I'm going, but will you stay?"

There's no time to think.
I...
"I'll go too. That's what I came here for."
"Then stay behind me. I'll let Archer lead the way. That way you won't get cut down the moment we get there."

Tohsaka starts running.
Archer takes form, gives me a single glance, and takes the lead.

"Please be all right, Ilya......!"
I clench the wooden sword in my hand and run after them at full speed.
...I can't act carelessly.
It's dangerous to make a move before I know what I'm getting into.

"I'll stay here. Are you really going to go, Tohsaka...?"
"Yeah. But you're making the right choice. I have Archer, but you're alone.
 It's good to be careful."

"...All right. Don't let your guard down, even with Archer, okay?"
"Of course. I'll come back right away if I think it's dangerous."

Tohsaka starts running without turning around.
...The tremors continue.
Tohsaka said Berserker is fighting.
Zouken and Assassin are the only other enemies.
Berserker will not lose in pure fighting ability.
Those two cannot beat him, no matter what tricks they pull.
Butwasn't that the case against Saber as well?


...I have a bad feeling. I feel like I'm making the same mistake again

"!?"
Darkness falls.
It's not because the light has been blocked.
My retinas are seared by black light, as if I've looked directly into the sun.

"What?"
My mind, filled with ominous presentiment, is filled with a different kind of uneasiness.
A complete darkness in which I have no sense of direction.
It feels as if I'm swallowed into "nothingness".

"......No way......!"
I fumble my way through the dark forest with my smashed vision.
Bam, crash.
I hit trees as I randomly walk on.

"Haa... Haa, haa, ha, ah......!"
I clumsily charge forward.
I feel blood on my shoulder.
My forehead's been gashed open where I hit it.
But I still want something definite.
Running into things and injuring myself is vastly preferable to having "nothing".

"HaHaa, ha, ha."
It's fine.
It's fine. My eyes just broke down because of the sudden light.
The forest is still there, and I still feel the ground beneath my feet.
It's just that my vision has gone black.
But it should go away in time.

...Only a bit longer until my vision returns.
I'm worried what that light was and if Tohsaka's all right, but I'm only going to pull her leg if I go to her with my eyes like this.
I have to concentrate on getting my vision back and escaping this darkness.

......
............
..................
........................
..............................Just a bit longer.
My vision should return soon.
I'm not worried about that.
My vision will return. That's a definite fact.


I'm just worried about the sounds around me.
The storm has stopped before I knew it.
I don't hear any crashing sounds, either.
Is there a reason that I'm not hitting trees anymore...?

"Just a bit more. Just a bit more."
The darkness will disappear soon.
I have to wait in this darkness until then.
I'll concentrate on that for now.
I can think later about why the sensation of the forest is gone.
I can also think later about the fact that my vision has already returned.

"......That's right. I have to escape this darkness"
I walk through the darkness, feeling nothing.
...Even though I know I'm in a forest, when it's this dark, I start to get bad ideas.

For example...
Like a ridiculous joke that...
I'm trapped in a world of shadows without an exit.

"HaHaha, ha"

I keep walking, bitterly laughing at my stupid thought.
I feel nothing.
But it's just a bit longer.
A bit longer.
A bit longer.
A bit longer.
A bit longer, and my vision should return, and the original scene will be back in front of me
We run through the forest.
In front of me is Tohsaka, leading the way.
Behind us is Assassin, pursuing us through the trees.

"Behind you, Emiya-kun...!"
She must be worried about us. Even though she could've escaped by now, she slows down and turns to look at us.

"......!"
I know that the enemy is right behind us.
But I can't shake him off.
Servant Assassin is after us.
There's no way I can shake him off when I have Ilya with

"That is far enough.  There is no need for you."

"What...?"
I hear an ominous voice right by my ear.
When I look to my side...

I see a white death's head, smiling as he licks the dagger.

"Guh!?"
The masked figure is knocked away.
While running beside me, Assassin was thrown off-guard by a kick to the side.

"...Hah. So you cannot even kill a kid unless you attack him by surprise, you third-rate?"
Archer does not slacken his pace as he talks.

"I will take the rear. You take Ilya and run.
 Hurry. We'll all die if that thing catches up to us."
Archer is looking at Assassin and something else that is coming from behind him.


...It's after us.
That shadow is coming after us while staining the ground black!

"What is that, Archer...!?"
"We can talk later. Run, kid. You took Ilya's hand, so protect her until the very end."

Archer slows down a bit and goes behind us.
...At that instant.
Right before he leaves, he gives Ilya a look heavy with regret.

I go through the forest with the sound of clashing swords at my back.
As Assassin follows, he is obstructed by Archer's efforts.

"Nu, guh"
Unable to sustain the offensive, Assassin is once again forced to retreat.
Their attacks are matched.
Even the daggers thrown at me are shot down, and it's obvious that Assassin is not in control of the fight.
But it's not because Assassin is weak.

"Hah!"
Archer repels the multitude of daggers.
His vigor is incomparable to before.
The scales of victory are tipping towards Archer.
I don't know why, but he is as strong as a fierce god right now.

"Nuhow can you still move...!?"
With even his strongest attack repelled, Assassin raises his voice as he retreats.
In response...

"It's simple. I'm not a respectable hero like the others. A heroic spirit that is not pure is no different from that mud.
 In other words"
Archer must consider it his chance of victory, as Archer charges.
"Although it is not to your degree, I am a distorted heroic spirit as well......!"
He cuts the white skull with one blow.

"Gi!"
The black cloak scatters in all directions.
Assassin retreats, clutching at his broken mask.

It is not a retreat to regroup, but a retreat to save his life.
The black Servant runs away from Archer and disappears into the trees.

"Nice job...! We don't have to worry about getting overtaken now...!"

"Thanks for the hard work, Archer. You're tired right? You can return to spirit form and rest."

Tohsaka looks relieved.
"Rin!"
Behind her...
"Toh-"
It appears, as if born from the trees' shadows.

"Huh, what?"
She looks behind her.
At the same time, the black shadow extends its tentacle and

"Toh... saka"
I won't make it even if I run.
I'll witness Tohsaka getting pierced by that black tentacle.

"Guh"
But the one I actually see impaled is Archer, who pushes Tohsaka aside.

"Huh......?"
Tohsaka looks up at Archer without comprehension.


It's the end for Archer.
He's still breathing, and he's not bleeding much.
It should be possible for him to heal himself even if he is pierced, as long as it's not fatal.
...But somehow, I understand that Archer cannot fight anymore.

...That thing kills Servants.
No matter how strong a heroic spirit one is, one cannot beat that black shadow as long as one is summoned as a Servant.
I vaguely comprehend that fact for some reason.

"No way... What... are you doing... Archer?"
...Tohsaka must have felt the same thing.
She calls to Archer with a trembling voice, stands up unsteadily, and
"Don't come...! Run away, you fool...!"
Archer's shout stops her cold.

The black shadow throbs.
The forest is dying.
All the magical energy here is being sucked by that shadow.


For some stupid reason, it reminds me of a water balloon.
It's like putting more water into an already-full balloon.
It's expanding beyond capacity, and I get the bad image of it explo

"Crap."
We'll get sucked up.
If we stay here, we'll be engulfed for sure.
...Archer pulls out the tentacle that pierced him and starts to run to Tohsaka.
Then I
I'll protect Ilya.
I can't try to save two people.
Tohsaka has Archer, but Ilya has no one.
Then...
I have to take Berserker's place!

"Get down, Ilya...!"
I tackle Ilya, forcing her to the ground.
And the instant I cover her body with my own...
My vision and perception is filled with black.

"Oh"

    It's hot.

My body is almost blown away.
The condensed and released wave of magical energy rages through the forest as a storm.

    It's not there.

My vision is painted black.
If it's this dark even though I can clearly see, a black sun must have come falling down.

    My body's not there.

It probably melted from the heat.
My body's not there.
The loss of my sense of touch is more disgusting than the pain.

"Haahah"
But that's a problem.
I can't protect Ilya unless I have a body.
The black shadow tries to take Ilya.
I flail my right arm to drive it off.
Embracing her with that same arm, I press her to the ground.

"Haah."
And I finally realize.
My body's there. My body must be there, or else I couldn't have protected Ilya.
...Man, I panicked too much.
All I lost was my left arm.
That's the only part of me that vanished without trace.  The rest of my body is still there.

...But I still have the sense of loss.
I only lost one of the two.
But it feels like I lost my whole body.


...It's disappearing.
The shadow fades away without trace, its energy spent.

...Ilya's safe.
My ears must be numb, as I can't hear what she's saying.

What... happened to Tohsaka?
Archer is... there.
His red cloak is painted a deeper red, and he's so weakened that he might disappear in the next second.

...How strange.
Why is she here?

"Have you gone mad? If you do such a thing, you will..."
"I do not even need to think about it. Two will disappear if I do nothing, but one can be saved if we transplant it.
 ...This body is almost dead anyway. If I am to disappear, it will not make a difference even if my arm is cut off."

Archer and Rider are talking.

...What the hell is going on?
And in the end...
"One would normally die. One cannot survive after attaching a spirit body to the human body. But the boy and I are an exception. Rin should treat him appropriately once she wakes up."
He tenderly runs his fingers through Tohsaka's hair.

My vision fades to black.
The dark sun no longer shines on the forest.
Then...
The darkness must be falling on my consciousness.
"So this is it. Farewell, Tohsaka."
Archer bids farewell in a voice that sounds just like mine.
Tohsaka is closer to the shadow than us.
Archer is dying, and Tohsaka, still in shock after his injury, cannot move.
Then I'm the only one who can bring her back...!

"Tohsaka!"
I let go of Ilya and run towards Tohsaka.
I'll still make it.
There are five meters to Tohsaka, and ten more to the shadow. If I run full-speed and pull her to the side, I'm sure I can manage something

And that thought proves to be a mistake.

The expanded shadow explodes in an instant.
I don't even have time to take her hand.
The shadow tramples over the forest under one breath.
And it mercilessly swallows the prey in its spider's web.

My temperature rises.
A fatal fever from the tropics drives my human body crazy.
There's no vaccine for it, but my body struggles to get away from the heat, and my mind abandons my body and dies first.

Without its soul, the flesh is easily swallowed.
As I melt into the black shadow...

  I think I hear the cry of an infant's birth.
In the end, Ilya will be coming to my house.
Tohsaka and Ilya leave the chapel, arguing.
I guess I can say they're getting along.


...Our conversation is over.
It's our problem now, so there's nothing to talk about with Kotomine.

I follow after them and leave the chapel.
But then...
"Do not forget, Emiya Shirou. That body of yours will no longer permit you to fight."
The priest gives his usual warning.

"That's not true. It's just that I can't use my left arm. I can still fight."
"I see. By the way, how is Matou Sakura's condition?"
"Sakura's condition...?"

...That's a bit unexpected.
I thought he was going to make more sarcastic remarks, so why is he suddenly concerned about how Sakura's doing?

"What's going on? What good would it do for you to care about Sakura?"

"It seems you do not understand. I am talking about your body.
 Look, Emiya Shirou. Your body is in critical condition, but Matou Sakura is carrying a more dangerous bomb. You will be safe if you do not fight, but she is breaking down with each passing second. That is why you cannot stop fighting, even though you know fighting will only bring you closer to death."

"........."
"Emiya Shirou has to fight if you are to save Matou Sakura. But now, fighting is like committing suicide for you.
 Thereforeyou must understand that saving Matou Sakura means killing yourself."

"......So what? That doesn't concern you at all."
I chose to save Sakura.
I won't back out on my oath, no matter what happens to my body.

"I see. A devotion to offer your life is beautiful.
 But is that woman truly so valuable to you?"
"What...?"

"This is your last warning, Emiya Shirou.
 To save a life is to satisfy one's desire.
 If you would like to keep Matou Sakura alivedo not forget this until the very end."

"......"
I go outside.
Tohsaka and Ilya are waiting for me there.
Ilya is looking up at the sky, and Tohsaka is glaring at me like she wants to complain.

"You're late! What were you talking with Kotomine about, Shirou?"
"Well, it was just his usual criticism"

More importantly, there's something that's on my mind, but I don't know if I should bring it up.
...Tohsaka.
Are you calling me by my first name now...?

"...Hmph, fine. We're short on time, so I'll get right to the point. This is a serious matter, and we don't have much chance of winning if we go our separate ways. I'll forgive you for what you did yesterday, so you'd better be grateful."

Her manner is pompous, but her words are even more so.
...Um, it's hard to understand, but what Tohsaka wants to say is...

"Tohsaka. Does that mean..."
"Yeah, I'm saying we can cooperate!
 First of all, you're unreliable. We're both out to defeat Zouken, so I can cooperate with you!"

Tohsaka continues angrily.

It feels like I'm hit in the head with a hammer.
The sudden request is a great fortune.

"OOh, thank you! I owe you, Tohsaka!
 There's no greater help than having you on my side...!"

I take Tohsaka's hand and shake it up and down.
This is troubling.
I know I'm being too happy, but I can't stop myself.

"Hey, I understand! You don't have to thank me, so hold on...!"
Tohsaka retreats quickly.
...Then.
I don't know why, but she looks at my left arm.

"...Let me ask you beforehand. You do know whose arm that is, right?"
"...?"
I nod, since it's a matter of course.

Tohsaka then takes a deep breath.
"Then you're my Servant from now on, Shirou.
 You were saved thanks to my Servant, so that's natural, right?"
...And makes a ridiculous demand.

"Wha"
"What?"
I'm really lost.
I try to figure out what Tohsaka means.

"W-What are you saying...!? It's stupid to claim his ownership just because of something like that!"
Yes.  Ilya can be reasonable, after all.

"First of all, you're completely missing the point. Shirou is mine, so there's no

 way he can be yours!"
...I see.
So she's missing the point too.

"Hey, you're the one talking big. Do you think Shirou is yours because you spared him once? Then that goes for me as well. I was so angry when I met him at school that I almost went berserk myself."

"That's just because you're immature. I spared him every day, so Shirou's life is obviously mine. I can choose to keep him alive or not, and you have nothing to do with this, so stay out of this."

"I have nothing to do with this...? Don't take me so lightly! I can't concern myself this much if I have nothing to do with this...!
 Archer entrusted me with him, so I'm going to take responsibility and make sure he stays alive!"

I can almost hear their teeth grinding as they glower at each other.
"......"
I wait for it to end.
...Well.
It's going to be troublesome, no matter who wins.

So, which one is it!?

It seems they've realized that fighting solves nothing, so they've chosen me to make the final decision.

"What do you mean 'which'?"
"So whose Servant are you? I haven't heard your answer yet, so it's best to clarify it now."

"Yeah. Rin doesn't seem to realize you don't want her, so you have to be clear.
 Come on, say it. You're mine, right?"

"......"
I don't need to think about it.
The one who has the right to order me around is
"It's Tohsaka. I don't even have to think about it."
"W-Why? Rin's oppressive, greedy, and loud like a myna bird. But you still like her more? Are you a pervert?"

"No. This isn't like that.
 This is about whether I'm going to obey Tohsaka, right? Then I'm going to obey her. I can't stop Zouken by myself, and Archer saved my life."

"That's... because Archer is your..."

"I'll give her the right to command me. See, that's just like being a Servant. Tohsaka, if that's what you want, it won't bother me at all."
I confirm with Tohsaka.

"............"
"Tohsaka? Hey, don't ask someone a question and then ignore the answer."

"Ohy-yeah, I'm glad you understand.
 My Archer put his trust in you, so we're working together now. He gave everything for you, so work hard and return the favor."
"Of course. I have to return what I borrowed."

...That's right.
No matter how things ended up this way, my left arm has been replaced by Archer's.
But Archer disappeared without fulfilling his contract with Tohsaka.
It's only right that I succeed the promises he's made.
"Um, I guess it's Ilya."
I say the name that popped into my head.

"Yeah! You lucky guy!"
Ilya hugs me.
I feel like I'm her brother, so I like how happy she is...

But Tohsaka is really mad, so my happiness adds up to zero... No, I think it's going in the negatives now.

"...Hmph. You've gone to a lot of work to flatter a little girl, Emiya-kun. Or what? Do you like little girls?"
Ow... Tohsaka scornfully emphasizes "Emiya-kun" to criticize me.
Her eyes look like they're blaming the socially weak, sending a wave of pain through my stomach.

"Haha, that's unsightly, Rin. It's unladylike to take out your anger on someone else when you get dumped. That's why Shirou hates you."
"......! D-Don't talk like a grown-up and say such a stupid thing...!
 I only talked about common knowledge, and first of all, who was dumped by whom...!?"

Tohsaka roars.
Ilya laughs and keeps hugging me.

"See, isn't Rin scary, Shirou?
 But don't worry. I'll protect you if she tries to do something!"

Ilya makes a big smile and embraces me.
I'm glad.
I'm twice as glad as before, but...
...Please do something about that cold stare of hers that doesn't let me excuse myself.

"What? If you have something to say, come out and say it."
"It's nothing. Your interests are none of my business. I'm not happy, but I'm not going to say anything about it.
 But more importantly, why?"
She asks me directly.
But...

"Well. 'Why'... what?"
I made my choice without thinking, so I actually don't know why I chose Ilya.

"...Unbelievable. Do you really have a thing for little girls?"
"N-No way, you idiot! I-I-I just said it because I felt like it, and I'm Ilya's guardian now, so it's natural for me to choose her! Do you have a problem with that...!?"

Man, I'm being illogical.
"Yeah! You're my Servant, Shirou!"
Tohsaka is utterly stunned, Ilya is jumping around in joy, and it's a big mess.

"......You're taking a defiant attitude now. Well, I'll let this go, but Sakura certainly has it tough."

I'm curious.
What exactly are you "letting slide," Tohsaka?

"But don't forget. Even if you don't use it, your arm is mine.
 You have a responsibility to take Archer's place.
 Your body doesn't just belong to you anymore."


I can't argue with that.
Tohsaka lost Archer, and my life was saved thanks to his arm.
...Then I have to help Tohsaka in his place.

".........Yeah, you're right. We'll leave the Servant thing aside for now, but I'll leave you in charge of everything.
 I don't know all that much, so it's better if you take care of the plans."

"That's right. I'm in charge of thinking, and you're in charge of execution. We're cooperating, so I'll make sure you work hard."

...That's right.
Regardless of how it happened, my left arm has been replaced by Archer's.
But Archer disappeared without completing his contract with Tohsaka. It's only right that I succeed the promise he could not fulfill.
But stillI have to stop Ilya...!

"No, don't go, Ilya!"
I jump out from behind the tree.
I grab Ilya from behind as

 she runs toward Berserker.
...The mad warrior's roar, the strong wind, and an explosion that even takes away my vision.
They all flow into my numb ears at once.

I hold Ilya in my arms as the wind knocks me to the ground.
White light fills my vision, and I can't even manage to stand up.
...No.
Standing up never crosses my mind.


...My body feels hot.
Something deep within me resonates with the attack.
I don't understand why, but this heat is in resonance with the Noble Phantasm.

"How"

My breathing has been deadened, just like my vision.
I can't do anything right now.
My body will not function as a human being as long as that sword is engraved in my eyes.

"Absurd."

I'm entranced.
My heart is taken away by something I only saw for an instant.

...That thing is an illusion far superior to the numerous other Noble Phantasms.
There are many that are crafted more splendidly and with better skill.
But the beauty of that Noble Phantasm is not its appearance.
No, to describe this sword as beautiful would only dirty it.

The sword is not beautiful, but sacred.
People's conception, legends weaved only out of hope.
It's not a myth, nor is it inhuman work. It is a crystal trained by heart aloneand that is why that sword will reign as the strongest fantasy.

My vision returns.
The sky is lit with dark-red light and is dark like night.
The light that split the forest must have been darkness itself.
The fire is burning silently, but the air is still cold.
Is it something that freezes oxygen instead of burning it?
The darkly lit forest lowers its temperature.


A swordsman is standing with the black fire in the background.
With Ilya still in my arms, I glare at the pointed sword.

I don't feel any hostility from the swordsman.
I fear my death, and at the same time, grit my teeth in vexation.

It's different.
She's a different person.
It's not just her hostility.
...She's...
I don't feel any of the nobility I previously felt from her.

Her helm breaks.
It must have been Berserker's last attack.
Her face is revealed, and although she is completely different, she's still the same.

"Sa... ber."

There's no reply.
The now golden eyes do not reveal anything, but plainly look down at us.

"Shirou."
Ilya's voice is trembling.
A sword is pointed at her, and Berserker is sinking into the shadow behind Saber.
The defeat of her Servant and her impending death.
Any young girl would tremble in this situation.

"Saber."
I shake off any unnecessary emotions.
I hug Ilya harder and put strength into my free right arm.

Now's not the time to be spaced out.
I'm going to save Ilya.
I'm going to save Ilya and return to my home.
So I can't just cower and wait for my death!

"!"
Saber swings her sword.
She tries to slash at me as I stand upand at that instant, parries three arrows shot from her side.

"Archer...!?"
I get to my feet, still holding Ilya in one arm.
"Don't stop! Take Ilya and run!"
The swords clash.
Archer shot at Saber, and attacked her without pause.

"......!"

But it doesn't do much.
Even with his godlike speed, Saber easily repels his twin blades.

"Guh...!"
Archer is acting strangely.
Looking, I see that the black shadow is entangling around his feet.

"How unsightly, Archer.
 True heroic spirits cannot oppose the layer of the cursed world. Right now, you are no different from the apparitions in this forest."

...The cool voice is definitely Saber's.
She easily smashes the black shadow and...

"Guh...!"
...Sends Archer flying into the forest behind him.

"Wha"
She struck with enough force to throw him back, in spite of his defense and the shadow holding his feet.


And once again...
Saber confronts us silently.
Her eyes.
They tell me she has resolved to kill me if I do not hand Ilya over.

"...Shirou."
Ilya lets go of my arm.
It seems she wants me to hand her over, and the last switch is tripped inside my head.

"Stay back. Tohsaka is in the forest. She should be able to do something if you make it there."
I push Ilya behind me and grip the wooden sword with both hands.

...I hold it at the ready, right in front of me.
I'll drive all of my power and magical energy as soon as Saber charges at me.


That's all I can do now.
I have nothing to say to her.
I can't apologize, nor can I tell her to come back.
I can't say something like that when she hasn't said anything herself.

Saber is in front of me as an enemy.
Then the only way to answer her is to fight with all my might.

"......!"
...I take aim.
I won't even try to take her life at the cost of my own. Saber taught me that such tactics are useless.
An attack with the premise of your death is only effective against an opponent as strong as you.
Against Saber, I can't hope for something as good as a mutual kill.

Therefore, I'm only aiming at one spot.
Her helmet shattered, so her head must be damaged somewhat.
That's where I'm going to strike with all my might.
I'll defeat my enemy and live on.
Unless I get that clear image in my head, I won't even be a match against Saber!


She's coming...!
Dodge it, dodge it, dodge it, dodge it...!
I don't care if I look miserable. I don't care if I have to crawl on the ground. Unless I dodge this attack, I can never protect Ilya

"Oh."

I'm dead.
I've fought Saber before, so I know this will be fatal.
The lightning-fast attack comes from the upper left.
Slicing through my neck will be as easy as mowing rice.

...But.
My head is still attached.
Saber's sword stopped just shy of my throat.


...What happened?
She silently sheathes her sword and jumps away.

"!"
...Could that be her reason?
The black pond expands on the ground.
The "shadow" is about to crawl out of there.

...I'm sure of it.
That's the thing I saw at the park the other night.
An unknown thing that's just like a cluster of curse

"My duty is complete. I shall leave the rest to you."
"I appreciate it. This is an easy job. I can make up for losing against the Majnun."
Saber walks over to the black mud.

...And.
She sinks into the mud, just like Berserker did.


I watch her until she completely disappears.
I don't care why she's still in this world or why she's my enemy now.
Now that we're enemies, all we can do is fight.
That is the nature of this war.


...But still.
I think for a secondthat she wouldn't have been stained black like that if I had been stronger.

"Emiya-kun...!"
"!"
Tohsaka's voice brings me back to myself.
In front of me are the approaching "black shadow" and Assassin, whose white mask is distorted with a smile.

"Let's run away, Ilya...!"
I take Ilya's hand and start running.

Ilya takes one sad glance at the mud that swallowed Berserker, then keeps back her tears as she starts running.
I trudge up the hill.
The town is unlively.
It's still eight or nine o'clock, but the town is desolate and devoid of any human presence.

", !"
Before I know it, I'm stopping and leaning against a wall.
My left arm is burning.
Maybe my tension went away by being alone, but my left arm started to hurt ever since I got to this hill.

"Well, of course. Someone else's arm is attached to me, so no wonder it hurts."
...I can't get my breathing together.
My arm gets hotter with every step.
When it gets hotter than my normal temperature, pain attacks my chest from my arm.

"Oh... So that's where it hurts instead of the arm, huh?"
I lean on a fence and take a deep breath.
...I think I understand where the pain is coming from.
Basically, it's trying to cool off.
I don't know how, but my left arm gets hotter every time it moves.
When it overheats, the arm sends the excess to the rest of my body.

"!"
That heat is enough to burn me, causing the pain.
The heat enters my body with a sharp pain, and it's more like a cut than a burn.
Every time I feel the red dizziness, I feel like I'm getting a long knife inserted from my shoulders and churned inside of me.

"Guhhaa, ha...!"
...It's not something I can bear many times.
I've had my stomach torn by Berserker and my ribs crushed by Rider.
Even with such experiences in mind, the prospect of getting stabbed by my own body sends a chill through me.

"It's fine, calm downit'll calm down if I don't let it get hotter"
I try to relax while looking up at the sky.
It's been twenty minutes since I parted with Tohsaka and Ilya.
I should've been home by now, but I can't let Sakura see me like this.
...I have to keep the abnormality of my left arm to myself.

"Damn Kotomine. What did he mean, it wouldn't interfere with my ordinary life? This can't be handled easily"
I place my hand on my left shoulder and press against the arm covered in red cloth.
Hard and rigid as steel, it doesn't even budge.

...Well.
I've stopped sweating, and my breathing is back to normal.
It's getting late, so I should quickly go home and see Sakura while I still look well

"I'm home!"
After taking a deep breath, I holler out and enter my house.
"...Oh... Welcome home, Senpai."
Maybe Sakura's been waiting all this time, because she's already at the entrance.

"...? You don't look lively. I'm glad you're welcoming me home, but I can't be happy when you're making a face like that."

I take off my shoes and go up into my house.
I want to rest for today.
I'll fill her in on what's happened today after I drink a cup of tea in the living room.

"...Wait, I can't do that. I have to tell her what's going on first."
Tohsaka will be coming soon.
I have to tell her about what's going on beforehand, or she'll be on guard against Tohsaka.

"Sakura, it's about what happened today."
"...Senpai. Aren't you going to say anything about that?"
...Then.
Sakura says something with difficulty.

"What do you mean?"
"............"
She keeps silent.
She's looking at my left arm.

"Oh, you mean this? Yeah, I'm sure you're surprised if it looks like this."
It's covered with cloth that doesn't look anything like bandages.
Even if she doesn't know what went on, she would assume something happened to my arm.

"Yeah, I injured it a bit. But it moves fine, and it's all right now. This cloth is just a bother, but Kotomine told me not to take it off.
 Well, he's the one who treated me, so I'm going to obey him."

I pat my left arm to show her it's all right.
...But Sakura is even more silent now.

"Sakura...? It's really fine. It looks worse than it is. It's just a scratch. It'll heal right away, so you don't need to worry"

"I-It can't be just a scratch...! Your arm's gone now! So how can you tell me that...!?
 I won't fall for such an obvious lie! Or are you not telling me because it's meaningless...!?"


Her reply is like fire.
...My insensitivity leaves me speechless.
I haven't even considered how Sakura felt all day today, waiting for me here.

"Sakura."
"Oh...... I'm sorry, Senpai. I-I didn't mean to blame you. ...You were so reckless and didn't care about yourself, so I..."

"No. Well, you're right, but you're wrong.
 I'm not mad because you yelled at me. ...Um, this is the first time I've seen you seriously mad, so I was surprised and was contemplating my actions."

"Eh... Contemplating...?"
"Yeah. It's certainly not good to bluff. All the more if it's to you. ...I probably didn't want to look bad in front of you. That's why I bluffed and tried to act normal.
 But now that I think about it, that looks worse. It's natural for you to get mad."

"Oh... No, you never look bad."
I do look bad.
...Man, don't tell Sakura about it so she doesn't get worried?
No, I was just putting on a show to look tough.

"Yeah, I'm sorry, Sakura. I lost.
 My arm turned out fine, but I couldn't be of use to you."

"Ohthat's not true...! You were splendid! I-I didn't see it, but you looked really good!"

"Ugh... No, I really was pathetic, so it hurts me if you say that. I couldn't save Ilya like I'd planned, and all I could do was come running home."

"...No. But you still came home. I'm really happy because you kept your promise."

"Ohyeah. That's good."
I scratch my head.
...But, well...
I'm embarrassed, but happy at the same time.

"...You're right. I guess being alive is good enough."
"Yes. You're good-looking. I fell in love with you all over again."

"!"
Sakura must have cheered up if she can say something like that with a big smile.

"Uh...... um."
I don't know how to reply to something like that, so...
"Um, what should I say, Tohsaka?"
"Who knows?  If you want my opinion, I just don't want you two flirting too much at the door."
...I ask Tohsaka, who is standing behind me.

Huh?
Our voices overlap.
Sakura and I both jump back at the same time.
"S-Since when were you there, Tohsaka!?"
"Why are you here, Tohsaka-Senpai?"
And we give the same reaction again.

"'Since when?'  I thought you'd be done filling her in already, but instead I find the two of you having a lovers' quarrel. Geez, do you even understand our situation, Shirou?"

Tohsaka sets down a large bag next to the door.
Behind her is...

Ilya, silently radiating a strange pressure.

"I-I don't mind if you want to continue where we left off yesterday, Tohsaka-Senpai.
 I'll fight you as Matou's magus as long as Senpai's protecting me."

Sakura clenches her fists and glares at Tohsaka.
...Well, it's more like a frog desperately opposing a glaring snake.

"......Geez. So you haven't heard anything about it?
 Look, Sakura. I'm going to put on hold what to do with you. My first priority is to defeat Zouken. We can settle our match after that. ...Well, we won't need to fight after Zouken's defeated, so everything should be fine as long as we can defeat him."

"Ehthen you're..."

"I'm going to ally with youno, with Shirou to defeat Zouken. So it'd be a waste to live separately, right? So I'm going to stay over here and train Shirou. It'll be hard work if I want him to become strong in a short time."

"So I'm going to borrow Shirou for a while. It's going to be rough, but you two don't mind, right?"
Wha
Tohsaka Rin sets a schedule even I haven't heard about.

"H-Hold on, Tohsaka. That's too sudden"

"Y-You can't do that...!
 Nee... no, Tohsaka-Senpai. What right do you have to say that!?"
".........I have to be mentally prepared first, you know?"

I stutter off.
Of course, my opinion is dismissed by Sakura's voice and Tohsaka's glance.

"Oh, so it's fine as long as I have the right? Then it's even less of a problem. It's because of me that he's alive.
 Shirou has to do what I say until he repays the favor. You'll give me a place to live if I ask, and you'll make meals for me if I ask, right?"

Tohsaka. Those lines could bring on a big misunderstanding.

"No way... I-Is that true, Senpai...?"
"Yeah. I want to object, but what she's saying is true."


"And it's better to have more allies, right? We know Zouken is after you. With Tohsaka's help, we can definitely protect you."
...And Tohsaka is Sakura's older sister.
If possible, I want them to be together, not fighting.

"......All right. I understand if you say so."
Sakura averts her gaze.
"Then it's decided. I'm coming in.
 Come on, Shirou, show me the guest room. I had my eyes on the guest room in the outbuilding last time I was here. Oh, where do you want, Ilya?"

"I don't care, but I don't want to be near that woman."
"Is that so? Then I guess you can have the Japanese-style room."
They're carrying on a relaxed conversation, and it sounds like they're close enough now to call each other by name.
"Then it's decided. I'm coming in.
 Come on, Shirou, show me the guest room. I had my eyes on the guest room in the outbuilding last time I was here. Oh, where do you want, Ilya?"


"Ilya? Why are you spaced out? You were so happy we were going to stay at Shirou's house."
"...That's not true. I was never happy."

A weak voice.
Ilya hangs her head and stares at the floor.
...As if saying the small step up is a towering wall.

"Shirou.
 Let me ask. Where is that woman sleeping?"
Then.
What happened to her depressed attitude? Ilya's now glaring at Sakura.

"...? Um, Sakura's sleeping in the guest room in the outbuilding."
"I see. Then you can go to the outbuilding by yourself, Rin. I don't care where I am, as long as it's not in the outbuilding."
"Is that so? Then I guess you can have the Japanese-style room."
They're carrying on a relaxed conversation, and it sounds like they're close enough now to call each other by name.
", So hot."
I wake up.
My pajamas are drenched in sweat, and my futon is kicked away.
I wipe my forehead and feel that it's wet with sweat.


...I can't think straight.
My brain might be fried from the midsummer-like heat.
I can't figure out what time it is or where I am, no matter how hard I think.


I go out into the yard.
I want to cool off my body more than anything.
...I don't know if the heat is coming from the room or my body.
I'm too lazy to think, so I'll sleep in the shed tonight.
It's cold there, at the very least.
It doesn't matter if it's hot or...

"Guh, ah!"
A sudden, sharp pain brings me to my knees.
". Ow"
I stay crouched, breathing heavily.

...I wake up.
I squeeze my left arm, the cause of the heat and the pain.
The Shroud is still wrapped around it.
The red cloth is restraining my arm.
I can move it, but it's wrapped so tight that the circulation is restricted.
Maybe this cloth is the cause of the pain.

"Maybe my arm's just as it was if I take it off."
The wild idea sounds very attractive.
First of all, I never saw my arm destroyed or transplanted.
It's not that I don't trust that priest, but I'm sure he makes mistakes too.

Maybe nothing is wrong with my arm, and my real arm will be there if I take off this cloth.
My arm isn't steel.
The cloth is just making my arm stiff, so if I remove it
My normal arm should be there.

Wha     I can't brea   my nerves, my nerves

           It hurts

I'm alive but       where is my sense

           It's cold

Death   hurry   I have to quickly get it back on

           It's scary

The arm      below the cloth is

           It's black

An arm that is not mine

"Whatwas I doing?"
What was I doing?
I unwrapped the cloth because of this sudden idea.
I don't understand what happened after that.
What has been done to me.
What will be done to me.
It only happened a few seconds ago, but I can't remember at all

"This is bad. It's really..."
I'll die if I release it.
The priest's words were true.
I don't know what'll happen, but what's under this cloth is not mine.

"......Forget about it. It's just that my arm doesn't move. ...If I think about it any more, I'll..."
I'll slow down because of fear.
That's not allowed.
Archer's arm wasn't transplanted onto me so that I could cower in fear.

"...That's right. I have to think about Sakura instead of my arm."
Sakura wasn't that different from this morning, but I don't know when she might collapse.
...I have to defeat Zouken and obtain the Holy Grail before that.
I have to think about how to do that.
A way to beat Zouken and Assassin with one arm.
...No, they aren't the only enemies.
There are the mysterious enemies too.


I don't know their circumstances.
I don't know what that black shadow is, nor if Saber became Zouken's Servant.
All I know is that she's my enemy now.

"........."
...To be honest, I know.
We have no chance of victory.
I don't know what this pain will be like in the future.
The difference in our powers is overwhelming, and I'm not even sure about myself.
How can I protect Sakura in such a state?
"Phew."
I release the depression in my lungs.
Such a ridiculous story.
Why believe in such a convenient deception?
I bet Tohsaka will get really mad before she laughs at me if she saw me like this.

"...It's fine. It's just that my arm doesn't move, so it's not a big deal. I have other things to worry about."

Sakura is a bigger problem than my arm.
She seems well, but I don't know when she might collapse.
...I have to defeat Zouken and obtain the Holy Grail before that.
I have to think about how to do that.
A way to beat Zouken and Assassin with one arm.
...No, they aren't the only enemies.
There are the mysterious enemies too.


I don't know their circumstances.
I don't know what that black shadow is, nor if Saber became Zouken's Servant.
All I know is that she's my enemy now.

"........."
...I know the truth.
We have no chance of victory.
I don't know what this pain will be like in the future.
The difference in our powers is overwhelming, and I'm not even sure about myself.
How can I protect Sakura in such a state?
"!"
I stand up at the sound of footsteps.
I know who it is without looking.

The Servant in a black outfit is silent like always.
She usually doesn't make a sound when she walks, but I'm sure she wanted me to hear her coming.

"What do you want, Rider?"
"............"
Rider looks down at me silently.
......Hm.
This is totally unrelated, but Rider is tall. There's something wrong with me too for noticing it now.

"What is so funny, Shirou? I have not said anything yet."
"Huh...? Oh, no. You're taller than me, right? Even though we've seen each other many times, I just noticed. I was laughing at myself for how slow I was."

"I see. You seemed like you were in pain earlier, but it appears I worried needlessly."
...?
It might be just me, but Rider sounds angry.

"Anyway, Rider. Were you the one who saved me today? I don't remember, but I think it was you that carried me to the church from the forest."

"...Yes. It was me. Sakura told me to protect you. I only obeyed her order as her Servant."

"I see. That was a big help, but that means Sakura used magical energy to use you, right?
 Then"
"Yes. There is now even less of her scarcely remaining magical energy. I will consume Sakura if she uses me like she did today."

Rider plainly speaks.
There's no pity or hatred towards Sakura.
Rider is only stating the natural fact as a Servant.

"Can I ask you something, Rider?"
"Of course. If you have a question, please ask it."

"...All right. Are you going to kill Sakura if she loses her Command Spell?"
A Master that uses up her Command Spells is first targeted by her Servant.
If they have not established a relationship of mutual trust, Rider will mercilessly kill her Master, using her life to stay in this world until she can form another contract.

...Rider is protecting Sakura out of duty. I see no affection there.
That's why I want to know what Rider's feelings are.


"Tell me. Are you going to kill Sakura?"
"Yes. If Sakura wishes, I would consider killing her to end her agony. But Shirou, I wish for her to live."

"...! Then you won't attack her even if she loses her Command Spell?"
"The binding of the Command Spell does not matter. I will protect Sakura willingly for as long as she remains a Master. I do like her."

"Ehreally?"
"Yes. Is it that unexpected for me to have such an emotion?"
"Oh... I'm sorry, I misunderstood. You didn't look that way, so..."

"You do not need to apologize. I do not engage in proper conversation with Sakura, nor does she talk to me.
 But Shirou. Servants are summoned by beings similar to them. You summoned Saber not by chance, but because you two are alike."

"Sakura and I are the same in that regard.
 We are not talkative, so it is natural for us to have no conversation. We understand each other without a need for such things."

...I hear warm emotion in Rider's voice.
I imagined her to be cruel because of her appearance, but maybe Rider is actually quite gentle.

"...I see. Yeah, that's great. I'm glad you're on Sakura's side."

"I see. Then it is my turn.
 Shirou. You do not know what kind of sufferings Sakura endured through. Do you know what she endured since she was adopted to the Makiri family?"

"That's"
...There's no way I'd know.
Well, Kotomine told me what kind of things she went through.
"...I don't know. So I don't think I can say anything about it, nor should I mention it."

...Yes.
I'm a magus, and I know what kind of a person Zouken is.
It's easy to imagine what happened, and my imagination should be close to reality.
ButI should not easily mention that I "understand".

"I thought as much. Sakura did her utmost to hide it from you. I would have killed you if you had claimed to understand."
"...Is that for Sakura's sake?"

"Yes. But it seems such measures were unnecessary.
 You are inexperienced and clumsy, but what is at your core is something trustworthy. That must be why you are a salvation for Sakura."

"...For a long time, Sakura knew only resignation. She did not feel pain or suffering, but accepted everything as it was.
 But she changed after meeting you, Shirou. You made her regain the emotions she had lost.
 The biggest emotions she regained were pain and suffering, but she only had resignation before, and you were the only salvation for her."

"......"
I don't really know what Rider is trying to say.
I cannot understand what Sakura has been through, so I don't know why she likes me.
But Rider's words are true because she shares her feelings with Sakura, her Master.

As if speaking for Sakura, Rider quietly states...
"Shirou. You said you will make Sakura happy.
 But for her, these two years were happiness itself."
...With quiet sorrow and appreciation.

"That is all I wanted to ask you.
 Happiness for Sakura is to have you alive and for you to be by her side. There is nothing else she wishes for."

Rider presses the question on me through her blindfolds.
...Asking me if I understand what that means.
For Matou Sakura, the fact that Emiya Shirou is fighting threatens her happiness.
So Rider is condemning me for what I'm planning to do with my body.

"But I"
...I tightly grasp my stiff left arm.
If I can fight with one arm, I should.

I swore to save Sakura.
I chose to fight for Sakura, and not to stop the war.

Soif I stop fighting now, I'll be nobody.


...Silence falls.
Rider is silent, and I have no reply.
How long has it been?

"......Are you on Sakura's side, Shirou?
 No matter what may happen in the future?"


I don't even need to think about Rider's question.
Emiya Shirou chose to be Matou Sakura's ally.
Then I should nod without hesitation.


I understand, but I can't express my feelings.
'No matter what may happen in the future'

Because I realize what those words mean.

"...Fair enough. You do not need to push yourself here, as the answer will eventually come to you. You should be prepared when that time comes."
Rider leaves as if melting into the night.
I watch her disappear, then look up at the sky.

"Damn."
...Yes.
I couldn't answer her because I realized.

The mysterious shadow.
The unstable left arm.
The ideal I sought for years, then threw away.
Everything is telling me.

That once I obtain the Holy Grail, it can make any wish come true.
Butmy wish to provide Sakura happiness is an illusion that can never become reality.
The shadow wavers.
The red knight is covered in blood, and Tohsaka Rin is sitting on the ground, dumbfounded.
About five meters away from them stand the silver-haired girl and Emiya Shirou, hand in hand.

...The shadow wavers.
After shrinking like a dead tree, the shadow expands like a blowfish.
No, its poisonous nature is like an uglier deep-sea fish.
The expansion continues without limit, swelling outward and dyeing the forest black.

At that instant.
The red knight dies protecting Tohsaka Rin, and Emiya Shirou survives by pure luck.
It is fortunate that the ground is uneven.
The expanding shadow passes over Emiya Shirou, who is in a hollow pit.
But his left arm is above its rim, unable to share in that fortune

"!"
She wakes up.
It's been half a day since she sent Rider to guard Shirou.
Matou Sakura, who shared vision with her Servant to follow the situation without ever leaving the house, is brought back to reality with that scene.

"Haaah, uh......!"

She feels like vomiting.
Her vision is blurred as if she had lost it, because she cut the shared vision off by force.
Her body is sweating, and as soon as she breathes
"Ugh... ha, ahh......!"
What's in her stomach rises up to her throat.

She runs into the dressing room.
She's covering her mouth with her hands, and as soon as she gets to the sink...
"Uh, ugh, uh...!"
She vomits out everything in her stomach.

"Oh."
She stands there with her head down, shoulders heaving.
Her long hair flutters like a curtain, hiding her face from the mirror.

"......No way. Senpai's arm..."
She recalls the nightmare.
...There's no mistake about the vision.
Emiya Shirou lost his left arm while protecting the silver-haired girl.
It melted away without trace from the shoulder down.

"What have I..."
Sakura masochistically yells at herself for considering such a thing.
She feels a chill and a strange uplift, not able to think about what happened and what she should do.
All she knows is that she hates herself.
...She previously got the idea that...
If Emiya Shirou were injured to a point where he wouldn't be able to go outside, he would not be in danger anymore.

"No... That was all wrong."
Yes, she was wrong.
It will not solve anything.
Was it simply carelessness that made her wish for him to be hurt?
Now he has been wounded, regardless of her wishes.
Not a wound that will keep him indoors, but one that threatens his very life.

There's no difference between the two.
That's what it means to be injured.
Why did she think that a misfortune to lose a part of one's body is a good thing?

"Ughah, uh.......!"
The nausea does not go away.
She does not stop vomiting even after throwing up everything.
Gastric juice and blood.
She thinks that the sharp pain in her stomach and the scratch on her throat is like a punishment to condemn her.

...And after a while...
Her nausea finally goes away when the gastric juice runs out, and she regains her composure.
She breathes heavily.
Her shoulders are moving up and down painfully.
She puts her hands on the sink and tries to calm down, as if she's just finished running a marathon.
"But Senpai can't fight anymore."
In a trance, she speaks her true feelings.

A short murmur.
Still breathing heavily, she raises her head.
The figure in the mirror is crushed by a feeling of guilt.
The apologetic expression is caused by her worry for Emiya Shirou's well-being.
She truly wishes for his safety.
The mirror reflects a face with a crooked smile.
It's hot.

I'm trapped in a sultry stone room.
The heat radiating from my shoulder is like a plague of microscopic bugs eating my cells.
My shoulder. The place where my arm used to be is covered with honey, and ants are swarming on it so it looks like a carpet.

It's hot.

My body is burning from within.
This isn't like a sultry stone room, but more like a sealed frying pan.
I hear the sound of something burning and realize that I've been scorched black.

It's hot.

The heat melts my mind, leaving my body untouched.
Slowly and fiercely.
It burns through my genes as if trying to overwrite them.

...Is this nightmare finally coming to an end?

It's hot.

The hole is sealed so that the ants cannot escape.
It's hot.
It's hot.
It's hot.
It's hot.
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot......!!!!!

The hole is in my shoulder.
I don't know why, but my missing left arm became a gateway, allowing the ants to flood into my body.
And the entrancethe hole to let them out is sealed with flesh that's not mine!

It's changing.
It's changing to something I don't know.
It's coming in.
Knowledge I shouldn't have is flowing into me.
It is his battle experience and battle information.

"Haah, gah!"

This is his Noble Phantasm.
It's not the pair of swords.
Kanshou and Bakuya.
Favoring the treasured swords made by an ancient blacksmith, he himself was a blacksmith heroic spirit.

That's why he creates.
He duplicates everything he sees and understands.
No.
It is not duplication, but projection.
A unique magic that reproduces the real thing using an image in the caster's mind.
Andthe heat burning my mind tells me to manage this skill.

"Haaahh, ah!"

Don't kid me. That's impossible. It won't fit.
I don't know about projection. I'm not at that level yet.
Cutting corners like this will destroy my body.
First of all, I have my hands full with myself. I can't memorize or use someone else's ability.
I don't have the needed power to begin with, and we're strangers with no connection, so there's no way it will become familiar with my body. No, I won't be able to bear it even if it becomes familiar with my body.
You can't put time out of order or destroy the regularity. Even if you help me, I don't have the skills to handle it

...My consciousness slowly returns.
I'm sleeping on an unfamiliar bed in an unknown room.

"...Huh...?"
I raise my body.
I thinkI met Saber at the forest, ran away with Tohsaka, and Ilya
"......"
Our eyes meet.
Ilya is beside the bed, staring at me with blank amazement.

"I see. So you're all right."
I sigh with relief.
I don't get the situation, but I'm glad Ilya's all right.

"Oh, good! You're awake, Shirou!"
"Huhwait, Ilya...!"
Ilya charges at me.

"Whoa."
"I'm glad... I'm so glad, Shirou...!"
Hugging me, she buries her face in my chest and repeats herself over and over.


...Man.
I don't get what's going on, but I can't do anything if she's crying like this.

"Does your wound hurt? I'll make him put on another one if you think it's slightly strange!"
"......? Oh, it doesn't hurt anywhere. More importantly, can you explain to me what happened after th"
As I speak...
"Gih!?"

I feel like a long knife is thrust into me.

"Hagih, guh!"
Unable to bear the pain, I tear at my chest with my right hand.

"Shirou...!? Calm down! Don't try to bear it, but try to repress your left arm...!"
"Ohleft... arm...?"
......I don't quite get it.
I don't, but I want to escape this pain as quickly as possible.

"HaaHaa, haah."
...I relax my mind.
Once I start meditating, I quickly understand which part of me is abnormal.
I can control it more or less if I know the origin of the pain.
I just need to create a barrier so that the foreign substance can't enter my body.

"Phew. I'm fine now, Ilya."
"Yeah, I can tell. I wondered what'd happen, but they don't seem to reject each other, at the very least."
"......?"
It seems like Ilya knows what's causing the pain.

"......Hm?"
I look at myself and notice that I'm wearing big hospital clothes.
...No, these are more like restraints.
All I can move is my right arm. Everything else is firmly belted down, and I can't take them off myself.

"What are these? Why am I wearing something like this, Ilya?"
"U-Um... that's..."
Ilya looks away awkwardly.
"I shall explain the rest, Emiya Shirou."
...Then.
A person I really don't want to see appears.

"She has recovered as well. All I need to do here is to explain the situation, so leave if you have no business."
"...Hah, yeah right. I'm going to leave with Shirou. There isn't a problem even if I'm here if you're not going to do anything, right?"

"I see, there certainly is no problem. But I would like to keep the explanation short. If you will not interrupt, go sit in the corner quietly."
"All right, I guess I'll do so."
Ilya passes Kotomine and walks to the wall.

"Well. I shall answer your question before I explain the situation. Do not be too surprised, Emiya Shirou."
Kotomine reaches out.
He unbuckles the belts and removes the coverings.

"Wha"
The arm there is not Emiya Shirou's arm.

I can tell even through the wrapped cloth.
...My left arm is not part of my body.
It is a foreign substance that should not be there, attached by opposing the natural Providence.

"Kotomine, this is..."
"It is Archer's left arm. In accordance with Archer's wish, I have transplanted it from his corpse."

"Archer's wish...? Wait, did you say corpse?"
"He disappeared after the transplant was completed. He was almost dead when he was carried here, but surprisingly, he endured until the operation ended. It must be because of his capacity for independent action."

"........."
Archer has been eliminated.
Then the remaining Servants are Zouken's Assassin, Sakura's Rider, and...

...No.
I don't think I can call her a Servant anymore.

"...Hold on. Archer disappeared, right? Then isn't it weird that his arm's still here?"

"His left arm would have disappeared too if he disappeared before the transplant was completed. But that has been cut and planted to your body while Archer was still in this world. It is a part of a heroic spirit that has been connected to your Magic Circuit, and it stays in this world using your magical energy.
 ...It has become a part of your body after the transplant was completed. The left arm will remain even if Archer disappears after that. That left arm is already yours now."

"Then... this is really his arm?"
"Yes. You two would have died in your conditions.  Archer lost the core that anchored him in this world, while you lost your arm in a mortal wound.
 Fortunately, Archer did not have many physical wounds, so he saved your life by offering you his body."


...The left arm that melted.
The heat that violated my mind, and this left arm that is not mine.
Everything tells me that the event in that forest really did happen.
I fell in that forest.
And I was saved by Archer after that.

"...But is it even possible to transplant a Servant's body onto a human's?"
"It's possible to just connect them. Spiritual doctors are said to heal the soul and not the body. I guess this priest here is the real thing, in contrast to his looks."

"I accept your compliment, but this is nothing to celebrate.
 Joining two separate spiritual bodies is forbidden magic. It cannot succeed.
 Spiritual bodies... resurrection and restoration of souls are divine mysteries that cannot be handled with magic. That is why I thought I only succeeded in shape, and expected him to die of shock, but"

"...Shirou and Archer are a special case. I found out earlier that he would pull through if the connection was made."

"...?"
Ilya looks away and lets her eyes wander sadly.

"Oh. Well, I do not know why. All I know is that you two were suited for each other. I was surprised when I started the operation. Even twin brothers would not look this alike."

I flex my left arm to test his words.

...I don't feel anything.
I don't even feel pain.  It's like a lump of dead meat.
It doesn't move, no matter what I do.
It's like a hand numbed by loss of circulation.
The sensation of a part of my body not moving brings mental fear rather than physical pain.

...The left arm is just a piece of metal.
One might feel constricted like this if one became a tin man.

"...It doesn't move at all. Was the operation really successful?"
"Do not wish for such an excessive thing. That is all it can do right after connecting it. It shall familiarize with your body in a few days. I told you earlier, but you two are compatible. At this rate, it should heal well enough to give you no trouble in leading an ordinary life."

"But be warned. I am only saying that the Magic Circuits are compatible.
 No matter how suited you may be to his arm, this arm is the arm of a heroic spirit, something a human cannot handle. No, it is more like a weapon than an arm. It is powerful, but it will swallow you if you use it."
"Does that mean I'll self-destruct?"

"Of course. If a human like you uses the arm of a heroic spirit, your body will be consumed by Archer's arm. No, the term blown away is more accurate."

"Your body is spiritually far inferior to Archer's arm. Archer's Magic Circuit will be activated if you use that arm even once.
 At that timeyour body will be unable to withstand Archer's magic, and it will break down.
 Look, it is not that your lifespan is shortened with each use.
 The time bomb in you will be turned on once you use it."


...What is that?
In short, that means I'll certainly die if I try to do what Archer does even once.
"......Then this cloth is for that reason...?"

"Yes, it is a seal. The Magic Circuit in your left arm will not be activated as long as you keep it on. Your arm is treated as a different object even if you use magic.
 But do not let your guard down. Magical energy flows through your body even if you do not use any magic. Pain will assail your arm as it reacts and tries to activate.
 Your left arm is covered with the Shroud of Martin to prevent that.
 It should be able to suppress the infringement from your left arm to a certain extent as long as you keep it on."

"Hold on. To a certain extent? That means..."

"It cannot completely suppress your arm. ...Yes, you will be consumed by Archer's arm whether you use it or not.
 If you want to live to old age, become a great enough magus to match the arm. You should then be able to seal your arm without the shroud."

"I estimate it will be about ten years before the arm consumes you. You have that much time. You can become a master magus and control your arm, or you can fail and be consumed. It is not an imminent threat."

"......"
This is like I was remodeled without my knowing.
...But it's no use complaining.
I would've died in that forest.
Transplanting Archer's arm was the only way to save my life, so complaining would mean I don't want to live.

"I understand. Let me thank you.
 ...You did another favor for me.  Could you please pray that it doesn't happen a fourth time?"
"I suppose I do not need to worry if you can talk like that. Then go outside. Rin is waiting for you in the chapel."

Kotomine heads to the door.
I get off from the bed and put on the prepared jacket.
I can't move my left hand, so I just drape it over my shoulder.

"Okay, it won't hurt if I keep my guard up. Let's go, Ilya."
"Oh... yeah, I'm coming."

...I exit and find myself in the courtyard.
The sky is dark, and it's already nighttime.

"I forgot to tell you, but you can easily take off that Shroud.
 The choice is always yours. You are free to use Archer's power, but your survival will not be guaranteed.
 Do your best with that in mind."

Tohsaka glares at me as soon as I enter the chapel.
...I don't know what I did to deserve it, but I'm relieved to know she's all right.

"Well. Everyone is treated now. Emiya Shirou's arm has been transplanted, and Rin's poison is purified. Is there anything else you require of me?"
"......Of course not. You might claim our lives as collateral if you do us any more favors."

"I see. Then we shall be parting here, but let me ask as the supervisor.
 What are you going to do now, Rin?
 The Holy Grail War is a failure now.
 The outcome is practically decided already, as most of the remaining Masters do not have Servants."

Tohsaka shuts her mouth.
...The match is pretty much decided, just like Kotomine said.
The only Masters with Servants are Zouken and Sakura.
...Ordinarily the last two standing would fight, but Sakura cannot oppose Zouken. Looking at it that way, it's already over.

"Matou Zouken will either recapture Matou Sakura or kill her. It will be difficult to stop him, and you are under no obligation to do so. There is no benefit to kill Zouken."
"Oh, is that because Masters without their Servants can't obtain the Holy Grail?"

"Right. That is why there is no reason to fight. Any more battle is meaningless.  You would be wise to stay in your mansion and wait until the war is over."
"Thanks for the warning. But I'm not going to forfeit."

"I'm surprised. So you cannot give up the Holy Grail?"
"Of course not. I'm still a Master, even if I lost my Servant. Don't assume that I'm going to forfeit just because I'm alone now."

"Oh. I see, you are certainly right. There is one other who shamelessly stayed on the battlefield after losing his Servant. So you cannot give up easily."

"Heh, Shirou has nothing to do with this.
 This is my decision. I haven't given up yet, and I don't intend to let Zouken win.  Neither of those will save her."

"Tohsaka."
I open my eyes wide and look at Tohsaka.

"W-Why do you look so happy? I-I didn't copy you, okay? I'm not giving up because I think I still have a chance of winning. I'm not like you, staying in it even when I don't have any chance."
"Yeah, I thought so. That's what I expected from you, Tohsaka."

"......That's annoying in a way too, but it's fine if you understand."
She looks away.

Tohsaka doesn't want to give the Holy Grail to Zouken not because of her sense of justice.
Sakura cannot be saved if Zouken wins.
If we want to save Sakura, Sakura has to obtain the Holy Grailor else someone who wants to save her has to claim it.

That's why Tohsaka said she or Sakura has to win.
That's the only reason she's fighting against Matou Zouken.
Tohsaka cannot obtain the Holy Grail anymore, but is still wanting to save Sakura, her younger sister.

"Hm. So what about you, Emiya Shirou? Will you not give up the Holy Grail, just like Rin?"
"No, I won't stop fighting. I have my goals too. I won't let Zouken do as he wishes."

"...I see. I shall not stop you if you want to fight. There is a hopeless difference in your powers, but Matou Zouken is a weak person. I am sure you can devise some plan."

"............"
"............"
We look at each other silently.

...Some plan, huh?
I can't come up with one by myself, but with Tohsaka, we just might figure out how to beat the old man

Our conversation ends.
The treatment is over, so Kotomine requests that we leave, as we are not asking for protection here.

"I'm leaving even if you don't tell me to. Hey, do you have a place to go, Ilya?"
"...? I still have my castle, and Sella and Leysritt will come if I call to them, so I still have a place to go back to. ...Why are you asking such a thing?"

"Well, it's dangerous to be by yourself, right? I want you to stay at my place if you don't mind. I think that's more convenient too."
"I don't mind, but I have to refuse. That woman is at your place."
Then.
Ilya answers me in a weird way.

"...?"
I stare at Tohsaka because I don't understand what she means by "I don't mind, but I won't go".
Oh, she looks like she doesn't want to interfere.

"Oh. So you chose Matou Sakura, Emiya Shirou."
"...Kotomine?"

"I do not mind taking care of Ilyasviel. Even if she goes back to her castle, Matou Zouken will only kidnap her."
"I refuse. I'm taking Ilya."
"No way. I'm borrowing Ilya."
"I'm sorry, but I can choose where I want to go."

".........
 That is unfortunate. So Ilyasviel is to stay at the Tohsaka household?"
"D-Don't say such a stupid thing...! The Master of Einzbern will not go to Tohsaka's house!"

"Okay. Then where are you going to go? You'll have to go back to your castle if you don't want to stay at the church, my house, or Shirou's place."

"I know. That place is my workshop, so I won't go into the care of another Master. I'm going to do things myself even without Berserker."

"Oh, I thought so. You almost killed Shirou once, but he came and saved you in spite of that. But you don't feel any appreciation and you're going back to your castle, huh?
 Did you hear that, Emiya-kun? After all you've done for her, she still hates you. She says she doesn't want to stay in that tiny house of yours."

"W-What are you saying, Rin!?
 I never said anything like that"
"You are saying it. You're not going to Emiya-kun's place because he's unreliable, right? You're saying you're going bac to your castle where you can feel safe."

"...That's true... But I'm going back to my castle because I have to get away from Shirou"
"Huh? Oh, I see. So him being reliable doesn't matter because you hate him, huh? Well, why didn't you say that in the first place?"
Tohsaka calmly criticizes Ilya.

"Oh."
This is bad.
Just as I'm worrying that this will turn bloody...

"T-That's not true! I never said I don't want Shirou! It's something else that I don't like...!"
"Hear that? You're really popular, Emiya-kun."
Tohsaka smiles gently, and Ilya glares at her with vexation.

"............"
...Um.
So whose house is Ilya going to...?
"Then let's part here for now. I'm going back to my house to pack, so you go on ahead."
"......? Pack? Are you going to come to my house?"

"Of course. We're cooperating now, so we have to be together. Ilya doesn't want to be at my house, and Sakura's living at your place. Your house has to be the main base, no matter how we look at it."

"Oh, yeah. When you put it that way, it makes sense."
"...Geez. I thought you were firm, but you're pretty loose too. Maybe I made the wrong choice."
Tohsaka sighs and starts walking in the opposite direction.

"...? My house is this way, Ilya. Why are you following Tohsaka?"
"It's just for a bit. Rin wants my help, so I'm going to go with her. I'll head over there as soon as we're done, so you go ahead."
"...?"
Ilya's going to help Tohsaka...?

"Really, Tohsaka?"
"Yeah. This is a serious matter, so we need one or two secret weapons. A secret I can't unlock myself might open to an Einzbern magus.
 ......But I really don't want to find one. If Tohsaka's inheritance, Kishua's keepsake, is just as I imagine, it's not something I can handle myself."

"Then I'm going as well. I'm not interested in Kishua's keepsake, but Zel Schweinorg's treasure chest sounds pretty."
Ilya's skirt flutters as she runs off.

"......Kishua? Zel? Schweinorg?"
I tilt my head in wonder.
I've never heard those names before. Are they famous among legitimate magi?
The guests have left.
The chapel regains its silence and the priest looks up at the statue.
"Was it fine to let the Holy Grail go?"
The voice comes from behind.
Where was he hiding? The golden-haired man asks the priest cheerfully.

"I do not mind. I never had any attachment to it. I will not stop the Holy Grail from siding with them."
"You're right. You had no wish from the startif your words are true, it would not make sense to stop the Holy Grail."
The man laughs.
The priest's words...
As if to make fun of the fact that he has no wish.


He does indeed speak the truth.
It is just that the golden-haired man cannot comprehend the fact, but the priest has no wish.
Kotomine Kirei does not need the power of the Holy Grail.
All he has is a thorough inquiry.

The Holy Grail merely answers one's wish.
It is a machine to create the desired outcome for one's own question.
Is there a meaning in obtaining the answer that one wishes for?

"Kotomine. Let me ask again. You really have no interest in the Holy Grail?"
"I have no interest in a machine that grants wishes. The same should go for you, Gilgamesh. Our goals are not our wishes. We are merely seeking pleasure because it is more fun that way.
 It is like eating food. A wish is something that is answered. But humans will not be saved if a wish grants itself."

The priest keeps staring up at the statue.
And beyond it.
To ten years in the past, when he still had a wish.

The man is a child his father was gifted with on a pilgrimage in 1967.
The name Kirei is supposedly a word of a prayer.
The father named his son in the hope he would be pure and beautiful.
The boy grew up according to his expectations.  Even as a young child, he had morals and good sense, showing such great insight that people thought he was precocious.
The father was delighted to be blessed with a great successor, and the son knew of his father's delight.
It is a great pleasure for a parent to know his child is gifted. That must have been why the man considered him valuable.
Understanding this, the boy grew just as his father expected.

There was no doubt.
His inability to love his father was unrelated to meeting the man's expectations.
The boy named Kirei grew up healthy.
......But there was one point.
He could not understand the "beauty" of which his father spoke.

One morning, he realized the inconsistency.
He woke up, raised his head, and knew.
He was not sure why he understood at that moment.
No, he wondered why it took him so long to realize.

In either case, he knew what he had forgotten.
His father prayed for him to be beautiful and named him Kirei.
That had always been his question.
The things his father considered beautiful...
The boy had never considered beautiful.

It was as simple as that.
He considered moths beautiful instead of butterflies.
He considered poisonous plants beautiful instead of roses.
He considered the evil beautiful instead of the good.
He had a common man's sense of morality, recognizing that  it is correct to be good.
But by his nature, the boy was only interested in the exact opposite.

Nobody can understand the agony he felt.
Even Kotomine himself was never certain whether it was agony or not.

But he worked hard.
He tried to be pure and beautiful, and pursued something he did not have from the start.
Shaving away the skin, ripping off the flesh, and dislocating the bones.
He even tried looking within his body for what he could not find in his mind.

His father spent over ten years on his pilgrimage wearing thorned shoes.
The distance he walked could stretch to the moon.
It was not for physical pain. For missionaries, the mental pain is far more significant.
The boy abstained from eating during their pious act.
If he was a sinner by nature, then according to the morals he believed in, he needed to punish himself to maintain balance in the world.

Ten years passed.
Unable to reach the epiphany he sought, he arrived at a single conclusion in its place.
It was simple.
In short, he did not have the sense to feel normal happiness.
Good matters that people consider right and find happiness in.
Philanthropy, trust, glory, safety.
Such matters did not delight him, and it's just that he was born with the deficiency.

All he took pleasure in was the suffering of others.
Murder by others, love and hatred of others, degradation of others.
Such negative concepts were the only things that made him feel happiness.
...His misfortune was carrying a sense of morality, even when he had such a mind.

The child understood at a young age that he was not in accord with the world, and he tried his best to overcome it.
He did not surrender to his condition by indulging in twisted pleasure.
He tried to save himself, one who could not find happiness in any normal way, by turning himself into a normal person.

And the path was his creed; to become a priest and preach life like his father.
It is said that God forgives everything.
So he thought God would even save someone "who is not born with it" like himself.

But the result was tragic.
He abode by the rules of God, followed the law, and lived modestly, but he could not find any pleasure greater than the pain of others.
He believed in the church's teaching that forbade immorality, yet immorality was all he had.

But there was no anguish there.
From the beginning, he sought after something that did not exist.
He did not lose something he had, so there was no reason for him to grieve.
The only thing that concerned the priest as he matured was the question "why?"

Yesat every crossroads of his life.
The pleasure of committing crimes.
One could understand if he reveled in his own corruption, satisfying his urges by committing crimes himself.
Wealth gained from evil deeds.
It would make sense if he entrapped others out of greed and obtained wealth.

But.
What was wrong with him to not even have the option of turning from good to evil?
Who could possibly be born a defective being and end his life still detached from the world?
Do they not come into this world with the premise that they harm the world?

Call of good sense.
Acknowledgment of morals.
Trial of justice.
Every one of these conclude that evil should not exist.
But what about it?
If it should not exist, why are such things created?

That is right.
If one has a deficiency, one should not be born.
The world hates evil and removes the faults.
But something that was never wanted was given life.
There are beings that exist to be hated and die.

The man inquired where the crime was.

His reward for years of anguish and blind devotion was not salvation.
Just... "why?"
It is a pure question, and also anger towards something unknown.

"Then why did you become a Master? You do not need the Holy Grail if you have no wish."

The inquiring words bring him back to the present.
The priestKotomine Kirei nods in self-derision.

"I did not need the Holy Grail. I was just interested in what was inside it.
 I sought the Holy Grail ten years ago because it tried to exist.
 No matter what it may be, I bless anything that tries to come into existence. That is my job."

"Hah. Is that the case even if you have no interest in what is born?"
"...Of course. Even in the last Holy Grail War, I was not interested in the Holy Grail or its contents. All I had back then was hatred towards a person who was the exact opposite of me."

But the priest ponders.
He can only find pleasure in others' suffering, but he is interested in the end of this Holy Grail War.
Zouken's actions behind the scenes.
Another Holy Grail that is about to be born.
Someone called "all evils of this world" was brought into existence by the people, but not wanted by the people.
If it would conceive such a thing, maybe that is

"The whereabouts of good and evil. Something that was stuffed in the shell, but never hatched."
The Holy Grail cannot give answers.
The wish-granting machine fulfills its owner's desire.
So no revelation can be obtained even if someone without a wish obtains it.
But

"What if I do not ask for answers, but instead create something from the Holy Grail that can give the answer?"
"What...?"
The man narrows his eyes.
The priest is smiling in front of the statue.
"Kotomine."
That smile is that of a dying woman.
That expression is worn by a man with no interest or desire.

"...The answer should come soon. If this question is a blasphemy to God..."
His eyes aren't showing joy.
The priest, like an angel that fell to the ground...
"I shall pledge before God.
 With all my might, I shall question the Lord even unto death"
...Looks up at the distant sky with cursing eyes.
"Oh yeah. Sakura, this is Ilya.
 Berserker's defeated, but we managed to save Ilya. We're going to have her stay here like Tohsaka, but please give her your best regards."
I introduce Ilya to Sakura, and Sakura to Ilya.

"Hello, Sakura. I hear you're the daughter of Makiri, but I won't look down on you. It seems you're Shirou's acquaintance, so I'll specially treat you like a human being."
"...You're right. Then I'll act like you do."

"...?"
That's the entirety of their introduction.
Ilya follows after Tohsaka to the living room.
And...


Sakura watches her go with cold eyes.

Dinner commenced like a storm.
...No, it's misleading to use the word storm.
That was more like a calm wind. Since there was no wind, I didn't feel the passage of time, and dinner ended like that.
The atmosphere was painfully tense.

"I'll cook dinner. It's like having soba to celebrate a move."
Tohsaka made dinner by herself after that. I hate to say it, but it tasted better than mine. Sakura might just be even with her in Western food, her specialty.

"Y-You're good at cooking, Tohsaka-Senpai."
Sakura was torn apart in shock, and she started eating silently.
I couldn't do anything extra because I was worried about things like Tohsaka's food, the fact that I'm eating Tohsaka's hand-made meal, Sakura's dejection, Ilya's tension, and Sakura's tension.

As a result, I couldn't taste how good Tohsaka's meal was. I was just made to realize how perfect Tohsaka is throughout the hour.

So.
"I need to prepare my room, so I'm heading off.
 I'll give you the details tomorrow morning, so you should rest for tonight."
Tohsaka even washes the dishes perfectly, then heads out.

"I'm going to my room too.  Everyone who went to the forest is tired, so your body won't last unless you get some sleep."
...It must be an insinuating remark to Sakura, who stayed at this house today. Ilya speaks without looking at Sakura and gets up.

"...Man, what's up with her?"
Tohsaka is just as expected, but Ilya's acting strange.
She's acting as cold towards Sakura as she did towards me the first time we met.

"Why is Ilya so aggressive towards Sakura? Do the Einzbern and Makiri families not get along?"

According to Kotomine, Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka are noble families of magi who started the Holy Grail War.
It seems the Einzberns were the highest ranked, so from her point of view, Tohsaka and Sakura must be below her.

"...Man. Don't misunderstand, okay? Ilya's saying that because she's moody, but you'll get along with her if you start talking to her.
 She's just really shy... Sakura?"
Sakura doesn't reply.
She shakes her head back and forth, and gradually starts falling back

"Sakura...!"
I grab her shoulders to stop the fall.

"...Huh, Senpai? Why the scary face?"
...Sakura hasn't noticed.
She looks at me like nothing happened, completely oblivious to her near-collapse.

"No, it's nothing much."
I let go of her.
"Oh..."
That must be why she noticed.

"...I'm sorry. I fell asleep because I'm a bit tired."
She apologizes for something she doesn't know about.

"...Well, it's only been a day. You should rest too. Let's listen to Tohsaka and sleep for today. We don't have to push ourselves to stay up."

"Y-You're right, I'll gladly go with that idea. I'll be up and well tomorrow if I get a good night's sleep.
 I'll cook breakfast tomorrow since Tohsaka-Senpai treated us tonight. I'm going to get back at her by cooking breakfast you've trained me in."

Sakura smiles jokingly and gets up.
...She looks to be standing steadily.
It won't change anything to follow her to the guest room.
Sakura seems well, so I have to believe in her.

"Yeah. Take Tohsaka down a peg.
 You're our last hope. We're cornered unless we can strike back here."
"Please leave it to me. I'll make sure to give her a punch."

"I'm glad I can count on you.  ...I'll give you what little help I can.
 We'll sleep early today and meet at the kitchen at six o'clock tomorrow. Is that fine?"
"Yes. I'll be waiting, Senpai."

Sakura bows and heads to the porch.
......Then.
"Um, Senpai. Please don't tell Nee-san about what happened earlier."
Sakura speaks in a tense voice without turning around.

"I know. You just fell asleep, so it's nothing to tell Tohsaka."
"Okay. Good night, Senpai."
...She closes the shouji.
Sakura leaves without turning around.


She must have been talking about the fact that she almost collapsed.
Sakura hasn't recovered as much as she thinks.
Kotomine said she won't last more than a few days.
Even ignoring what Zouken will do to her, she is unstable.

That's why Sakura's trying to act fine.
As if telling us...
That she's all right, and that we don't need to worry about her.

"...Nee-san, huh?"
Sakura says that word only when she's alone with me.
And only when she's feeling faint-hearted.
...Sakura calls Tohsaka "Nee-san" when she can't suppress her cries for help.
Their complicated upbringing created a wall between them.

They may be able to return to being normal sisters if that wall is destroyed.
That might be the best thing I can do for Sakura right now.

"...Yeah. They're acting awkward, but they show some hope."
This situation was dumped in our laps, but it may be a good opportunity after all.
I see a dream inside the breeding box.
Egg's shell.
Black yolk.
There's no memory of the sea of love.
Reaching the placenta.
The line does not exist from the beginning.
Labor expulsion is not allowed, and is melted into love.
There's no memory of miscarriage.

    Swaying as I walk.
    Wavering brain is empty,     and the grinding intention is forgotten.

    Shivering and trembling.
    The dried limbs are like paper balloons.
    Rolling across the ground.
  Floating comes after maturing.

    Roaring.
    Roaring.
    Roaring.

"Hey, look  that gi, iswet?"
    Someone approaches with squeaking.
"Hey, it's a pretty good-looking woman.  barefeet? Damn  she's ]"
    People approach me.
"It's .  bored  want to  with us?"

    Dried up laughing voices.
    I do not remember tempting them.
    I am scared, so I should go home.

"Hey  why  running "
"Hold on ? Hey  she re !"
"I bet  is. You won't walk nain  town "
"Hahaha! Yeah  that's  we need to protect  or ?"
"Agreed! I  to protect  socially  wea!"

" Hahaha!"
"Ahhahahaha!"
"Ahahahahahahahahaha"
"Ahahahahahahahahahaha!"

    They follow me.
    They echo loudly in my head,     so my stomach growls.

"!!!!????"
"Hey  wha, wgih!?"
"A-Ah  don't run, help  ehhh!"
"Ha, ha, ha, where are you gu
 Giiiiiiiiiiiiii!"
"Ow, ow, no, I-I'm sorry, i, hiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!?"

I see a dream of a breeding box.

Tonight.
I squashed a bug.
It is a bit sudden, but...
The entire city of Fuyuki is having a blackout, so we will be training in the dark today.

I don't care, but it's really dark.

Yeah, it's really dark.

...It's lonely.

...Yeah, it's lonely.

..................

..................

..................Hey, Ilya-chan.
Can I tell you the truth?

...I don't really want to know, but what?

Yeah. ............Doesn't it feel like there's someone else here?

...!!! Stop it, Taiga. Even if it's a joke, geko...!?

Ahaha! That was a funny scream, Ilya-chan!

..............................................................................................................................

........................Ilya-chan?
Hey, don't scare me like that. You're the one lying there making weird panting noises, right?

YES, THAT'S RIGHT, ONEE-CHAN.

Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Liar, who are you, gekoko!?
Osu! We're starting the Tiger Dojo, the place to save those that could not escape and died even after a strategic retreat.

Yeah, yeah, we're starting. Geez, this is boring.

Hah!

Why sulk, pupil number one!? I told you it's against the rules to bring emotion from the main story into this dojo!

Okaaay.
But I really can't back him up this time.

Hm, this is the worst sulking I've seen out of you. Do you hate the fact that he put priority on Tohsaka-san?

...No. I just thought it wasn't fair for Archer.

Hmm. Some hidden circumstances I don't understand.

Oh, well. Tohsaka-san, Archer-san, Shirou, and Ilya-chan all died together in a friendly manner!

Hey, it's no laughing matter, you dumb tiger!

Geez, we're done for today!

You are to go back to the choice and obey Archer's words.
You can't turn off the game today until you get out of the forest!

I return to my room to rest after lunch.
Tohsaka had something to do, so she went to her room with Ilya.

"I'm going to take measures against Zouken with Ilya's help. It should take some time for the crest to familiarize itself with your body, so you can rest for the whole afternoon.
 You'll just get in our way even if you're here."

That's how it is, according to her.
We have no way to oppose Zouken right now.
So all I can do is to wait for whatever Tohsaka's preparing.

Sakura has returned to her room.
Sakura was feeling dizzy while we were cleaning up after lunch.
I wasn't worried because she seemed well this morning, but Sakura is no different from a sick person.
Tohsaka and I told her to rest if she's feeling even a bit tired, so Sakura is back in her room now.


I check out how my arm's doing.
It didn't move at all before, but I can manage to move my elbow now.
It's still numb, but I feel no pain.

If I'm to talk about pain, the crest Tohsaka planted hurts more.
My shoulder, throat, and belly button.
It feels like bolts are in those areas as if I'm Frankenstein.

"My left arm is borrowed, and my body is held together with bolts, huh?"
It reminds me of cyborgs one would see in science fiction movies.
It's an interesting idea, but I can't laugh it off.
...I was going to check how my arm's doing, but I didn't even stand in front of the mirror.

It's almost two o'clock.
Well
I'll go see how Tohsaka and Ilya are doing.
I'm curious about what they're up to, and there might be something I can help with.

"Nope. You're just a bother, so get out of here."
Then.
One second after I knock, she kicks me out without time for a rebuttal.

"Hey, what's with that attitude? It could get scary later if you kick away someone's goodwill."

"What goodwill? We're going to be using the Tohsaka and Einzbern's secret magic, so there's no way we can show it to other people.
 I'm glad to know you want to help, but your behavior itself is harmful. I'm sure you don't want us finding out about your secrets, right?"


...I see.
When she puts it that way, I see her point.
There are things I can't tell her, even if we're cooperating.
Anyway.

"Tohsaka. Why are you wearing glasses?"
"...Why? ...What, does it look funny?"
"Well, it's not funny, but"
Her honor student style has upgraded, and she looks like some president now.

"It really suits you."
"...I-I see. I don't really know because I only wear glasses when I'm alone, but... it doesn't look funny?"

"No. I might be tricked into believing that you're an honor student even though I know your true nature. Are you trying to hide your character?"

Hm? Did the room suddenly get cold?

"Tohsaka? Um, I'm suddenly getting chills running down my back."
I ask her with my eyes if it's just my imagination.
"Oh, what a coincidence. My shoulders are shaking too, Emiya-kun.
 I'm thinking I should settle my match with you. If you have enough free time to be walking around, how about I train you until you can't walk?"

"Uhum."
...Scary. She's serious.
It seems she really wants to punish me for walking around when she told me to rest and save up my energy.

"...Sorry, I was being careless. I'll go rest in my room like you told me to."

"...Hmph. It's fine, but don't you have something else to do if you can walk around like that? We aren't the only ones who might need your help."
"...? Who else needs my help?"

"Right in the next room. For her, having you by her side is a big deal. You should know that. You're the source of Sakura's energy."


My face burns up.
It's really embarrassing to have someone else say that.

"Oh, okay, I understand. If I can go see Sakura, I'm going to."
I nod awkwardly like a robot.

"Of course you can go.
 ...Geez, you're usually rough, but you're really careful in the stupidest things, idiot."

She shuts the door.
Sakura's room is right next door, not even a meter away.

"Calm down, calm downI'm just going to see how she's doing."
I take a deep breath and glare at the door of the next room.
I-It's not like I have a guilty conscience.
I'm just going to check if Sakura's really resting or not.
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Rider all day.
Considering her, I'm sure she's keeping watch on Sakura from a distance, but I have to greet her if she's around.

Rider is nowhere in the house.
There's her room, but it didn't even look like it had been used.
Then a place where she may like and where Sakura's room is in view...

This is the only place I can think of.
The shed is the only spot that has a good view of Sakura's room, is concealed, and is unoccupied.

"Are you here, Rider?"
I call out to the empty shed.
"I am standing by. Do you need something, Shirou?"
Rider must've been in spirit form, as she suddenly appears.

"........."
Well.
I came to greet her, but I get tense when I actually stand face to face with her.
I don't care about Rider's personality to keep everyone distant from her, but as a guy, her overexposing outfit is troublesome.

"...I asked you if you had any business."
"Oh, no. I really don't have any. I haven't greeted you today, so I just wanted to say good morning."

"I see. You must have a lot of free time."
Her response is direct.
But this is within my expectations. This is actually easier for me to handle because this is what I expect from Rider.

"Yeah, I'm bored. I have some free time, so I'm just walking around. Are you guarding Sakura from here?"
"Yes. I am Sakura's Servant.
 I will not protect you or Tohsaka Rin unless she gives me an order to do so."

"Really? I'm glad to hear you say that."
I sigh with relief.
I was worried, but it seems Sakura isn't pushing herself.

"Thank you, Rider. Please give Sakura your best regards in the future as well."
I wave and head for the yard.
"Please wait. I have a question."
"...?"
I stop in front of the door.

"What? There aren't many things I can answer."
"No, this is about you, so you should be able to answer.
 Emiya Shirou. I do not understand your previous statement.
 I refused to be your guard.  How can you call that a good thing?"

"Huh? Oh, that's your question?
 I'm sure I'd sleep better with knowing you were guarding me, but I'm a guy, and guys are supposed to protect themselves.
 Tohsaka is... well, I'm sure she would deal with anything that came her way."
"......You are going to protect yourself with that body of yours? It only sounds like a bluff to me."

"It is. We're the weaker ones, so we'll lose unless we bluff.
 ...Well, to be honest, I can't help but feel uneasy. But I still want you to keep this stance. It will tire Sakura if you move around. I don't want Sakura to use any more magical energy."

"I see.  Moving about will certainly burden her.
 I burden her just by taking form. So you do not want me to take on excess work?"

"Right. I just want you to protect Sakura.
 And if I ever get killed, can you protect Ilya as well?"
"...How convenient of you. You know I am a burden, but you want to rely on me in the worst case?"

"Yeah... Is that asking too much?"

Rider doesn't answer.
Her blindfolded eyes stare directly at me.

"Um... why not make a deal? I'll definitely help you if you're in danger. It's give and take, so can you take Ilya into account as well?"

"I cannot respond to that. There is a high probability that you would already be dead if I were in danger. Your proposal is not attractive."

"Gah. You're right. It's meaningless if I'm dead before you're in danger. ...Oh, I'm sorry. I was really being convenient."

...But I'm troubled now.
That means it's better to take Ilya to a safer place.
She doesn't want to go the church, but leaving her alone in her castle is even more

"Geez. You really are unreliable."
"Huh? Did you say something, Rider?"
"Yes. I said I will consider your proposal. If you save me when I am in danger, I shall definitely do as you wish. Is that all right, Shirou?"

"Ohreally...!? I was being really convenient, you know!?"
"This is reasonable. It is only if you save me first."


I'm stunned.
...Um, I'm glad that Rider accepted my proposal, but, more than that...

"Rider. Did you just smile?"
"No. There was nothing to be happy about, so there is no reason to smile."
"But you were smiling, even if there wasn't a reason. It was really subtle, so I almost didn't catch it."

"That is not possible. You are mistaken as I am denying the fact."
Rider declares.
Hmm, now that she mentions it, maybe she's right.

"............"
"............"
Hm... The air is getting strangely tense now.
I was going to go back to the main building, but I'm concerned about Rider.
She's silent and cold like always, but it seems like she has something she wants to say.

"............"
"............"
The air gets tense as if we're facing off.

...But...
I know this is abrupt, but Rider is tall.
Long hair, slender limbs...
I've only seen it once, but her face under the mask was beautiful.
Tohsaka and Sakura are beautiful too, but Rider has an entirely different sort of beauty.

"Do you have a question, Shirou?"
"Huh? Oh, it's not much of a question, but can I ask it?"
"I do not mind. What is it?"
"Okay. You're tall, Rider. Exactly how tall are you?"
I ask her straight-out.

...Wait.
Why is she backing up?

"Rider?"
"N-No, it is nothing. Please do not mind me."
"...All right. So, how tall are you? You're taller than me, so you must be over 170."
"I-I will not answer that question. Please ask me something different."

"You won't answer? You don't know how tall you are?"
"N-No, that is not the case. ...Regardless, please ask me something different. I will be angry if you persist in this."

"Hm."
Rider is obviously disturbed.
The usually cool Rider is flustered, so could it mean that

"Rider. Are you self-conscious about your height?"

Rider freezes.
It seems I guessed right.

"............"
"............"
We both shut our mouths.
She must not be able to bear the silence...

"...I-Is it strange...? For me to be worried about such a thing?"
"Huh? No, I was just wondering why, and not because I found it strange. Why does it bother you?"

"...Is it not obvious? A tall woman like me is unsightly, unattractive"
"Why? It's good-looking."
Actually, she's asking too much.
I want her height. Really.

"............"
"............"
And silence again.
It finally occurs to me that I could be distracting her from guard duty.

"Um. Am I bothering you, Rider?"
"...Yes. I am hiding in preparation for Matou Zouken's surprise attack. However, it will do little good if you are talking to me like this."
"Right. Then I'll be going back now. I'm sorry I bothered you."
"Ohhold on, Shirou."

She stops me, and I turn around for a second time.
Rider bites her lip in annoyance, then...

"If you have free time, please go nurse Sakura. It really matters to Sakura if you are there with her or not."
"Oh... you're right, I'll go right away. Sakura pushes herself when I'm not watching. I'll go see if she's really resting or not."

Rider's right.
Sakura's room is near here, so I'll take care of her this afternoon.

"Oh. That's right. I remember why I came here."
I turn to Rider for the third time.

"W-What is it, Shirou?"
"Good morning, Rider. I haven't greeted you yet, right?"
Good, good.
It'd just be stupid if I forgot to greet her when this is the whole reason I came here.

...Then.
"Good morning, Shirou. Then I shall also say something I held back."
Rider regains her composure and looks down at me coldly.

"What?"
"You waste effort on useless matters. It is too late for a morning greeting. It is already after noon."

"Ugh, I'm sorry. I honestly forgot about you until just now."
"I thought as much. Please take better care in the future.
 And please forget what I said earlier."
"...? What do you mean?"
"How you must think I am a nuisance. I misunderstood you, so I take it back."

"I don't think you're a nuisance."
"I understand that. I would expect no less from a person who comes out to greet me."

She smiles.
I'm not mistaken.
She's really smiling.
I'll go see how Sakura's doing.
She did go back to her room, but I'm worried if she's really resting or not.
"You there, Sakura?"
I knock quietly.

"Oh, Senpai...?"
I hear a sluggish voice.
"Oh, please hold on. I'll get changed right away...!"
She must've been sleeping, and now she's scrambling to meet me.
After two minutes...

"Sorry to keep you waiting. Please come in."
"Oh... okay, excuse me."

I suddenly get nervous that I'm about to enter a girl's room.
I've been here before, but the situation is different.
Sakura wasn't conscious back then, but now she's opening the door and inviting me in.

"So, is anything wrong, Senpai? I was sleeping, so I don't know if anything went on."
"Oh, it's nothing like that. I didn't come here because something happened. I just came because I was worried that you weren't resting properly... but"
It seems I woke her up as a result.

"Aha, then I passed. I was resting like you told me to."
"Yeah. I'm sorry for waking you up. You should know about your own body. You wouldn't push yourself and move around if you're sick. ...It seems I was caring excessively."
I contemplate my actions.
But Sakura starts laughing.

"...Ugh. I'm worrying too much?"
"No, that's not true. You're pretty sharp.
 To be honest, I wanted to continue cleaning.
 I was thinking about sneaking out if you didn't come."
"Whoa... sneak out?"

"Yes. I didn't want to rest when I feel fine because it makes me feel like I'm sick. So I wanted to act normal, in spite of what you told me.
 But Nee-san got mad and told me not to be foolish.
 She said it's a bother to you two if I push myself and collapse."

"Hm."
...That's right.
We stopped Sakura from doing the laundry after lunch.
She wouldn't listen to me, but when I was wondering how to convince her, Tohsaka came to help.

But it wasn't anything nice...
"If you collapse, we'll have to kill you."
...As her harsh words would indicate.

"...Yeah. Tohsaka was mad."
"Yes. Nee-san scolded me."

Sakura sounds happy.
......I see.
She knows that Tohsaka cares about her, no matter what she said.

"Then you have to rest.
 No matter what you may think, your body's tired. Tohsaka and I can go outside without worries if you're resting like this."

"...You're right. But I'm really healthy. I'm just not feeling well right now, and I'll be back to normal tomorrow. This is just like that cold, and I'll get over it in a day."

"...You idiot. I know I'm not one to talk after I woke you up, but you should rest.  Sleep, if you can.
 I'll come wake you up for dinner, so you just relax until then."
I get up to leave.
But.

"Oh"
Sakura grabs my shirt.

"Sakura...?"
"UmI'm going to sleep like you told me to, but...
 Um, It'll make me happy if you're by my side."


Sakura rarely demands something.
She must not want to burden others, so she tries to do most things by herself.
But Sakura is asking something from me right now.
Well, this is nothing, but it must be the most selfish thing she can think of.

That's why she looks so uneasy.
I'll do any favor she asks of me, but she only asks trivial things like this.

"Okay. Then I'll stay here a bit longer."
I suppress my urge to embrace Sakura and manage to tell her.
"All right! Then I'm going to go brew some tea! I'll treat you the best Chinese tea!"
Sakura heads to the door in a hurry.

"Hold on. I'll brew the tea, so you stay in bed. You're putting the cart before the horse."
"Oh... Y-You're right. I'm acting strange."
Sakura hurries back to her bed.
I pat her head as I pass by and go to brew us some tea.

But.
This situation is more nerve-wracking than I thought.
I'm alone with Sakura.
She's right before my eyes, and I can see her bare neck and her captivating breasts.
That alone, umreminds me of what happened that night, and I don't know where to look.

"But to be honest... I knew you liked Nee-san. Because you're always so happy in front of her."

...So everything Sakura says goes over my head.
I'll lose control if I look at her too closely.
...I'm a man, you know?
Recalling what happened that night makes me want to push her down and get a taste of her body again.

"...Isn't it? I'm not attractive like Nee-san. And you seem to like Ilya-san too.
 ...Um, do you not like girls with big breasts?"

I take a deep breath and calm myself down.
I can't push her down when she's not feeling wellwait, having sex with her will help her.
Then it's not bad.
It's not bad, but

"............"

That's right! Tohsaka is next door, first of all!
They'll notice right away if I do such a thing, so I'm sure they'll look down on me for doing it so early in the day

"......Wait, Sakura...? ...Um, did I do something to make you angry?"
Realizing that Sakura is unhappy, I come back to the real world.

"...No, you haven't done anything. That's the problem."
"...?"
"...Um, I said something very suggestive. You weren't listening, though."

"Ugh... I'm sorry. I was spaced out. Um, I think we were talking about Tohsaka..."
"Yes. We were talking about Nee-san. I was asking if you're happy now that Nee-san's staying here."

"Oh"
...That's right.
I was asking Sakura about our situation.

"So how is it? You like Tohsaka, right? So doesn't this make you happy?"

"...Yes, it is delightful. But I'm also feeling uneasy. Nee-san is my ideal, and she has many things I could not obtain. That's why I want to look away when she's near me, and I can't be honestly delighted.
 It feels like I'm being condemned by Nee-san and myself for what I'm doing."


I can understand Sakura's point.
It's painful to have your ideal in front of you because it makes you feel inferior.
...Well, I do understand, but...

"...Sakura. Your ideal is someone like Tohsaka?"
I ask timidly.
Tohsaka might punch me if she was here.

"Yes. I've always wanted to be like Nee-san. Oh, it's not as a magus, but as a girl.
 Nee-san can do anything, and she's always dignified. I want to be as cool as her."

Sakura sounds happy.
...Hmm.
I hate to admit it, but Tohsaka certainly is cool.
She's really manly in the sense that she takes responsibility for what she says.

"...I see. But you couldn't see Tohsaka until now, right? Something about the agreement between the two families. So how do you know about her?"

"You can't help but wonder.
 Nee-san and I don't remember about when we were small.
 It was so long ago.
 But we both knew that we were sisters."

"That's why we were more interested, and we watched each other from afar.
 We never sat down and talked, but I heard a lot of rumors about Tohsaka-Senpai, who was a year ahead of me."

"Oh. You must mean the rumor that she's a perfect honor student.
 Now that you mention it, you never run out of things to talk about her since she's famous."

"Yes. And it's not like I never met her.
 She would often greet me at school and come watch the archery club."

"...And I would always think at those times. That I'm content that she's watching me. I'm happy that she's worried about me, and I knew she would hate me if I ask for more."

"......? Why would she hate you?"
"...My magic is not like Nee-san's. There is no set limitation on how you use your magic.
 Senpai's magic is to accomplish something and to create a phenomenon. There is no restricted goal set from the start."

"Hm... You're right. Strengthening is one of the only things I can do, but you can use a strengthened object to do all sorts of things."

"...But the Matou magic is different. Matou's magic is limited to 'stealing away from others'.
 There is no other use for it. It only feeds on other people's pain, and there is no teaching to return their happiness."

"........."
I can't just nod in response to that.
I don't know what kind of magic she was taught at the Matou household.
The magic she was taught is a heresy, and Sakura is ashamed of it.

...The problem between Sakura and Tohsaka is the difference in their family's magic.
The more Sakura hates the magic of Matou, the more self-loathing she feels

"So you hate magic of Matou?"
"Senpai. That's like asking someone if she hates breathing."
Then.
Sakura looks up and starts talking like Tohsaka.

"I don't like it or hate it. I just couldn't live without it.
 I was adopted by the Matou family for that reason alone. If I hadn't been able to succeed them, I would have died."


"Oh, please don't make a face like that. The teaching was certainly strict, but it wasn't as tough as you may think."

"And if you want to talk about strictness, it's not even close to your training.
 I'm fine with getting hurt by others, but I'm scared of hurting myself.
 I want to live, so I can't end it myself.
 I don't mind other people cutting my wrist, but I'm scared to cut it myself."

"But you can do either. ...Um, I've seen your nightly training.
 I-It was only once, though. I forgot something here, came back, heard something in the shed, and went to check it out."

Sakura bows her head in apology.
But I don't want her apologizing for something like that.

"No, you don't have to apologize. That's carelessness on my side. I'm a failure as a magus if I can't notice the presence around me."

"...............Um."
"More importantly, when was that? Was it right after you started coming here?"
I really hope so.
I'm improving, even though it may be really slowly.
If I didn't notice Sakura's presence recently, that means I haven't improved at all.

"...It was last summer. It's the day Fujimura-Sensei brought a watermelon."
"I see, that's good."
I sigh with relief.
I guess I can excuse myself if it was half a year ago.

"...So, um, Sakura. ...Well, what did you think?"
She's the first person besides Kiritsugu who saw me training in magic.
I practiced in front of Tohsaka these past few days, but that's different from the training I do in the shed.

So Sakura's opinion is like a test.
Sakura is Matou's magus, so I might be able to get a good score

"Umm. I guess I'll use my right to remain silent. I'm not Nee-san, but it'd be terrible if I put a score on it."
"Ughdoes that mean I got a failing score?"
"Ahaha, you can say it's a really bad failing score."


...Crap.
Sakura doesn't seem similar to her sister, but she actually is.

"But Senpai. That's the only time I saw it. ...No, I couldn't see it again because I was too scared."
"...? Too scared...?"

"Yes. Not only that, but I thought many times that I should stop you.
 ...Your training isn't normal. It looked to me like you were stabbing your own throat. It's not that I imagined it, but it really did look that way. ...Your training was that dangerous."

I understand what Sakura wants to say.
Creating a Magic Circuit is close to death for me.
My body would explode if the concentration in me is off by a few millimeters.
But isn't that an ordinary compensation for a magus?
Kiritsugu was the one who told me that death is a magus' constant companion.

"Really? I hear that it's like that for all magi. Maybe it looks dangerous for me because I'm unskilled."

"You're wrong. It's not a question of skill. First of all, you're special in that you can use magic when you don't have the talent.
 Magic is not something you use, but something you teach the body. No magus creates a new Magic Circuit for each spell the way you do."

"......?"
"I'm talking about the final result.
 ...Every night, you did something that could kill you. Nobody forced you, and you didn't get anything out of it. But you stubbornly continued."

"...I think that's something even Nee-san can't do.
 You follow through on what you've decided until the very end, regardless of whether it's right or not. So you're probably the strongest one out of all of us."

"Wait"
I-It's really embarrassing if you say something like that with a straight face.

"YYou idiot, I'm not giving you anything, not even if you flatter me!
 F-First of all, Tohsaka's the strong one! A-And I don't know what kind of a magus you are, but you're the successor of Matou, and you also have Rider...!"

"No, you are strong, Senpai. It's not because of your Magic Circuit or your talent, but because your mind is pure.
 ...I knew that from the very first time I met you.
 I knew you would never betray anyone."

"Uhwell..."
I don't know how to respond when she talks seriously like that.

"...Thanks. I'm glad you said that, even if you're just flattering me."
I'm embarrassed, but I tell her how I feel.
Sakura...
Smiles happily and looks straight at me.

"......!"
This is bad.
The distracting thoughts I shook off earlier will return if she makes a face like that.

"...Um, I guess I'll get going now. You're sleepy too, right? There's always tonight, so you should rest well in the afternoon."
I cough intentionally.
I look to the wall... to Tohsaka and Ilya on the other side.

"Y-You're right. There's tonight too, and Nee-san is next door."
She must understand how I feel, as she blushes and starts muttering.
...I bet I look like that too.

"Then I'm going back to my room. I'll come get you when it's dinnertime."
"Ohplease hold on, Senpai...!"
"...? What is it?"

"U-Um... I'd be really happy if... you could stay here until I fall asleep..."
I bitterly smile at her intermittent words.
Actually, it's something I want to ask her if I can.
She's so timid that she probably doesn't even know how much I've fallen for her.

"Okay. I'll stay here if I'm not a bother. I'll go after you fall asleep. Is that fine?"

"O-Of course! I'll do my best to stay up!"
But Sakura...
I'm glad you're saying that, but that defeats the whole point.

Sakura suddenly falls silent once she lies down.
She must've been tired. It looks like she suddenly got sleepy once she laid down.

But still...
"But Senpai. I'll get well if I rest today, but what about your arm?"
She must have no intention of going to sleep, as Sakura keeps talking.

"My arm is doing fine. It doesn't hurt as long as I keep this cloth on, and it's slowly starting to move. At this pace, I'm sure it'll move fine by tomorrow."

"That's good. It's been a while since Nee-san treated it, right? It looked like it was just first-aid, so I thought the effect might've worn off."
Sakura smiles with relief.

". What do you mean, it's been a while?"
"Nee-san's at fault too. She's free to transfer her crest, but the Tohsaka's Magic Crest will never familiarize itself with anyone not from the Tohsaka family. She should know it was just a makeshift that won't even last seven days."

Sakura says it like it's nothing.
But
"Won't even last seven days...?"
It sounds very out of place.

"Yeah. It's about to wear off, so you have to get properly treated. My magic can't solve the root problem, so I'll ask Rider if she has any good ideas"
Sakura looks sleepy.


I can't reply.
...I can only convince myself that Sakura is saying strange things because she's about to fall asleep.

"...You're there, right, Senpai?"
"Yeah, I'm here."
"...Good. Please stay by my side, Senpai.
 I have nightmares if I'm alone, so please"
...Sakura slowly closes her eyes.
Her breathing becomes more gentle, and she goes into a deep sleep.

I turn off the light and leave her room.
"............"
I saw Sakura fall asleep peacefully, but I don't feel any peace of mind.

So pleasekeep watch and be on your guard against me.

...I think that's what she said unconsciously...
...Right before she fell asleep.
Light that destroys my eyes.
The strong headwind pushes my mind and body away from the entrance.

The light is too strong for me to perceive what it is.
My body, exposed to the wind, is rusting with each passing second.
How long will I stay here?
An infinity that is not even a second, and an instant close to eternity.
With no sense of time, years change to seconds.
Therefore, my body is eternally exposed to the wind, polished and clouded like a mirror, and crumbling apart.

"Oh"

     Go forward.
     This place is painful.

A zero gravity without any handhold.
An airless vacuum.
The world of wind erosion is not a place one can stay in human form.

That's why I move forward.
My volume doubles with each step I take, and it gets harder to breathe.
One step.
Two steps.
The third step is impossible.
I can't go any farther. The wind gets stronger the more I advance, tearing at my body.

But I have to move forward if I want to escape.
The wind is coming from the other side of the light.
The light is the entrance and the exit.
This place hurts.
So I have to quickly get to the other side.
A stronger wind is there once I pass the entrance.
Once past the exit, this pain would become lighter.

"Haah, ahh!"
I reach out my hand.
I reach out with all my might.
The light is in front of me.
But I can't reach it.
The polar light destroy my eyes.
I can't reach it no matter what.

It hurts.
I can't reach it even if I cough up blood and reach out.
Why?
It's only a meter away.
So why?
Why does it feel like I'm trying to head to the distant polar lights?

"Shirou."
"Eh?"
I wake up.

"You can't. You'll die if you take it off just because it's painful."

I blankly stare at Ilya, standing before me.

"Ilya...? Why are you in my room?"
"Because my room is close to yours. I woke up early, so I came to look at you."

...Man.
It seems she woke up before me and came here.
I don't care about that, but maybe Ilya did so because

"...Hm. Was I having a nightmare?"
"Yup. You were moaning in pain, trying to pull that cloth off your arm.
 Well, I came here because I expected you to do that. I suppressed the pain while you were asleep, so it feels better now, right?"

"Oh"
I now notice that my right hand is on the cloth covering my left arm.
.....Oh man.
If Ilya hadn't come, I might've taken it off in my sleep.

"I see. Thank you, Ilya."
"You don't have to thank me. It's between you and me.
 And I promised, right? That I'll help you when you're in trouble."


Her smile captivates me.

I know Ilya's just saying that out of kindness, but...
"Fufu, and I wanted to see your sleeping face. You were in pain, but your were trying your best to endure it. You were so cute."
I slam the brakes on my panicking heart.

"Ilya. It's not good to go into someone else's room without permission.
 Mornings and evenings are out of the question. I'm an ordinary guy, so it's troubling."
"Oh, really? How is it troubling? I want to know in detail."

"Ugheven that question is troubling.
 First of all, you're a girl, so you can't go into a guy's room in the morning. It's dangerous. It's really dangerous. You're not just endangering yourself, you're putting the innocence of an adolescent boy at risk too."

"Really? But that makes even less sense. What's so bad, and what's so dangerous about it? I won't stop unless you tell me why."

The silver-haired girl puts her hand down, gets on all fours, and...
"See, I'm closer to you now. So, why is it troubling for me to come near you in the morning, Shirou?"
"Y-Y-Y-Y-You idiot...!!!!!"

I roll backward head-over-heels while keeping ahold of my futon.
That was close.
Guys experience a certain physiological phenomenon every morning.
I could be given a man's mark of shame if she comes close to me in such an outf

"Oh."
"Gah"
I hit the back of my head hard.

"Ah, guhthat's why... I said it's dangerous."
I make up an excuse.

"O-Okay. I'm sorry, Shirou.
 ...Um, did it hurt...?"
It hurts.
I saw stars and my head is throbbing, but I can't be whining if I hear a voice like that.

"No, I'm fine. It was a good wake-up call, so don't worry about it."
I shake my head and get up.
My morning issue has calmed down thanks to that.

"...All right. It's about time, so I'm going to go cook breakfast. What do you want, Ilya? If there's anything you don't like, say so now."

"Eh? No way, you can cook!?"
"Well, I can cook like everyone else. I don't know about Western snacks... but I guess I can manage pancakes."
Ilya's face lights up.
It seems the fact that I can cook is a delightful thing for Ilya.

"Hmm... Then do you want to make it together? I thought I'd go get you after breakfast's done, but it's better for you to be in the living room if you're awake."
"Really!? Yeah, I'll go! I want to see you wearing an apron!"

"I see. Then let's beat Tohsaka together with the three of us.
 I promised Sakura we'd be cooking together this morning, so we'll have the strength of three with your help."
"No. I'm not going if Sakura's there. You go by yourself, Shirou."

"Eh... Why? Because Sakura's there? Do you hate Sakura?"
"No, I actually rather like her. But I can't approve of her because she's not suited for you."
"...? What do you mean by not suited, Ilya?"

"It's true. You ought to know why, but you're trying so hard not to notice it. Telling you now won't do any good."
Ilya goes out into the hallway.

"And I don't know what kind of trance you were in, but don't keep charging ahead recklessly. You're watching Archer's magic, not Shirou's magic.
 ...I know you'll eventually obtain the magic, but there's only the possibility right now. Your body will destroy itself from within if you try projection in such a state."

"Projection?"
I repeat Ilya's word absentmindedly.
At that instant...
The cocking hammer goes down.
The dream I saw while I was treated.
I vaguely understand what it is and what it means.

It's probably...
Projection taken to the utmost limit, reproducing every weapon you've ever seen and making them your own.

"...That's right. Archer's Noble Phantasm is 'magic' that only he can use.
 Archer is a blacksmith heroic spirit that can reproduce any weapon he sees. The power is something you can use too, now that you inherited his arm. You're probably not conscious of it now,  but you'll remember the activation spell if you put your mind to it."

"But don't think about using it just because you can. That priest is right. If you remove the cloth and use projection even once, you will certainly die.
 ...So don't take it off, no matter what. I won't forgive you if you die like Kiritsugu. I'll never forgive you if you leave me alone before I kill you."

Ilya leaves.
Her warning contains both caring strictness and murderous hostility.
"Senpai, I'm done cleaning the turnip. How are the chicken wings going?"
"Yeah, I'm done skimming the foam. Let's cook it once we've cut those into four pieces."

"Okay. What are you doing with the curry powder, Senpai?"
"I'm making the sauce. We'll put it on the sardines. Even if Ilya doesn't like fish, she should be able to eat it if it's curry flavored, right?"

"I see, you're smart, Senpai! Then I'll cut the fish, so please check the simmering."

"Huh? No, I can cut the sardine without the knife, so you don't have to. I'll ask for your help when I get to the center bone, so can you make simmered pumpkin with broth and soy sauce? I think we should have at least one sweet dish."
"Okay. Oh, you look like a sushi chef when you're cutting the fish one-handed like that, Senpai."

Sakura goes to the refrigerator.
Sakura must be feeling better after a good night's sleep, because she's in a good mood this morning.

"Hm."
And standing in the kitchen with her is fun for me too.
Sakura is thoughtful and is attentive to my needs, preparing things ahead of time.
It feels really good to cook with someone like that.

"Senpai? Sushi chef, your hands aren't moving."
"Hm? Oh, I was spaced out. We should hurry. It's almost seven o'clock."

I sigh so she can't see and continue cutting the sardine.
Sardine is soft, so it's better to use fingers than a knife. It's something even I, one with my left arm not moving, can manage to cook.

"But when did you learn such a technique? It's not normal to do it with just your right hand."
"It's not a technique. This is about timing and determination. I'm sure you can do it too if you try."

"Oh, is that so?"
"Yeah. Techniques are things like cutting apart a cow with a kitchen knife or making an ice sculpture.
 Here, take care of the rest. We'll cook it after you're done, so put it in the bowl."

I move away from the cutting board and walk to the gas burner.
I put the frying pan over the fire and pour some oil onto it.
My body knows how to do this, so I do it absentmindedly.

"Um, Senpai...?"
"Hm?"
I vaguely reply.

"...This might be none of my concern, but did something happen between you and Ilya-san?"

My hand stops.
But it's only for an instant.
I'm sure Sakura didn't see my disturbance.

"Yeah. We talked before I came to the kitchen. Ilya has a lot going on. I really don't know how to answer her."
"...Is that a problem as a Master?
 Does Ilya-san still want to fight?"

"No. I don't feel a will to fight from her. ...No, I don't think she had such a thing from the start. I think she tried to obtain the Holy Grail as the Master of Einzbern, but Ilya had another goal.
 But..."

...That goal disappeared long before the war even started.
Ilya's goal.
Emiya Kiritsugu, the one she wanted to meet, died five years ago.
Thenwhat can I do and what should I do in his place?

"Hey, Sakura. Is it all right if Ilya stays here if she doesn't want to go back to her country?"

"Ohum. This is your house, Senpai. My opinion doesn't really matter."
"What are you saying? This is your house. I can't decide on something important like having Ilya stay without consulting my partner."

"II'm your partner...!?"
"Yeah. Who else would it be?"
Neither Ilya nor Tohsaka can help me with cooking this perfectly.

"Sakura, the frying pan's ready."
I take the sardine Sakura prepared.
Sakura hands me the sardine with an airy motion.
......?
What is it all of a sudden?
Did she get a fever again...?

"O-Okay, I understand...! I'll do my best to get along with Ilya-san...!"
"Yeah, it'll be great if you can. Ilya said she doesn't hate you, so you should be able to get along with her if you talk with her."

...Yeah, I'll be really happy if that happens.
After the Holy Grail War is over, Sakura and Ilya will be here making breakfast without worry.
I'll pay any price for such a wish to come true

"Good morning. You two sure are up early on Sunday."
...Wait.
Something amazing just passed by.

"S-Senpai... did some strange person pass by just now?"
"...Ugh. If you saw it too, that means it wasn't just my imagination."
We timidly look into the living room.

The person that shambled over to the table glowers as she pours herself some tea and turns on the TV.

"...I'm surprised. Tohsaka-Senpai isn't a morning person..."
"......"
Wait, Sakura.
Doesn't someone who's not a morning person, um, look cuter?

Breakfast starts.
Sakura and I sit next to each other, while Tohsaka and Ilya sit across from us.

"Oh, wow. This has some refined taste, Sakura. I guess this deserves to be eaten."
I don't know if Ilya is attacking or praising Sakura.

"Geez. I usually don't eat in the morning."
Tohsaka complains as she eats the omelet.
"Hm."
...Then, for some reason, she silently starts concentrating on eating.

"......"
Breakfast continues quietly.
The only loud thing is the TV Tohsaka turned on, offfering many topics of information.

"Hm......?"
A familiar scene is on TV.
I can't be mistaken.
The TV is showing a baffling story about a park in Shinto.

"......A missing person in central park? ...A lot of blood around the area...?"

It's a pretty vivid incident.
An old man was jogging in the park, found a trace of blood, and reported it to the police.
A policeman came to the scene and found what appeared to be one person's worth of blood and pieces of the apparent victims.
...But it seems the pieces are just scraps of flesh, and that they don't even weigh fifty kilograms when gathered together.

"...The police are trying to figure out the four victims' identities... wait, why four people? There was only enough blood for one, right?"

"That's probably because the scattered flesh came from four people.
 I'm sure there were only leftovers, but that must have been enough to figure it out."

"...Tohsaka.
 By 'leftovers'... do you mean this is a Servant'sZouken's doing?"
"Who knows? I can't tell if Zouken had a hand in this.  But I'm sure that shadow did this. See the corner of the screen? The grass has turned black. It's exactly like when the shadow appeared in the forest."


Tohsaka states simply.
But I'm not convinced for two reasons.

"Why? No matter what that shadow may be, it hasn't done anything like this before. It has sucked up magical energy from people, but it never, um..."
Directly killed people like this.

"...You're right. The only reason I can think of is that there aren't any enemies now. There aren't any Masters now that can defeat them straight-on. So that means they can do whatever they want without worrying about whose attention they may get, right?"
"Does that mean they're being indiscriminate?"

"...I don't know. I'm the one that said it, but it doesn't seem like it. Even if Zouken and that shadow are related, I'm sure this was an unforeseen accident.
 I'll bet my omelet that Zouken is surprised to hear this news as well."

...Tohsaka's omelet is gone as she speaks.
Her hawk-like eyes are looking at the only untouched omelet on the table, mine.

"......Hm. Why do you think it's an unforeseen accident?"
"It's not cleaned up. With the blood aside, Zouken's not someone that would leave pieces of the dead body behind. In other words, Zouken was not at the scene, and that shadow was the only thing that ate there."

"I see. ...Then one more thing. How do they know there were four victims? There was only one person's worth of blood, and there was only one person's worth of flesh."

"It's the shape, not the weight. I'm sure there was four of something people only have one of. That way, you'd know how many victims there are without any identification.
 See. If there were four left hands in a pool of blood, anyone would know how many victims there were."

Tohsaka states simply.

I imagine the scene and my appetite quickly goes away.
After breakfast...
"Shirou. We have to do some things, so come with me."
Tohsaka takes me to the dojo.

I had no reason to refuse and I also wanted to talk to Tohsaka, so it was a timely offer.
It was, but...
"Hey. I only wanted Shirou. Why are you all following him?"
Tohsaka is unhappy at the unexpected guests.

"...Um, you're menacing, so I thought it's dangerous for Senpai to be by himself."
"Hey now. I made a pact with Shirou, so I won't attack him. You know that, so why did you follow us, Sakura?"

"B-Because it's my role to protect Senpai."
"...You declare, huh?
 Then how about you? You should know what I'm going to do. Did you come to heckle me?"

"No. I'm here for the same reason as Sakura.
 I know what you want to do, but I don't know how you're going to do it. I came to make sure you don't do anything strange to Shirou."

"...Oh well. I'm going to tamper with his body for his own good, so don't jump to conclusions and interfere, okay?
 We don't have time to be taking things slow."

She must have prepared it before breakfast, as Tohsaka's bag is at the dojo.
It's full of equipment like what I saw at her house, and it's easy to guess what'll happen, but...

"Sorry. Can I say something beforehand?"
"What? Don't tell me now you don't want anything that hurts."

"Of course. Nobody wants anything that hurts.
 Anyway, any normal person would run away after seeing these things with no explanation."

The other two nod.
I have two reliable supporters this time.

"I'm sorry I'm not explaining things to you. I know I'm not normal compared to you. You can go somewhere else if you have any complaints."
Oh.
Tohsaka's sulking, unhappy about the three-on-one situation.

"No, I'm not complaining. I have a vague idea of what you might be doing. That's why I'm putting every trust in you. I'll trust you no matter what you tell me to do. I promised you last night, right?"

"H-Heh. Then why did you stop me?
 If you don't have any questions, then sit and be quiet."

"No, this isn't about that. I want to make sure what our future course of action is. We have to decide now what we should be doing."

...Everyone's expression changes.
What I just mentioned is a problem we all postponed last night.
What we will fight against, and what we will do.
We can't back out after we make our decision.
No, we already can't back out, so this is just a statement of our resolve.

"........."
"I'm not going to take part in battles. I'll fight if someone attacks me, but I don't intend to start a fight myself. I don't know what'll happen even if I win this Holy Grail War."

"...I feel the same way as Ilya-san. I don't think I can beat Grandfather.
 The match is pretty much decided, so I don't think Grandfather will come attack us if we stay quiet here..."

"............"
...Tohsaka doesn't say anything.
I don't know what she's thinking, but I want to believe she has the same opinion as me, since she's not agreeing with Ilya or Sakura.

"You're right. I agree with concentrating purely on defense.
 Sakura stays here to defend against Zouken.
 Rider is with Sakura, so she should be able to defend Sakura and Ilya if she concentrates on defense."

"Tohsaka and I will try to come up with a way to defeat Zouken.
 We'll be attacked eventually even if we stay here, and we can't leave them be. We don't know if something like this morning's news is going to happen again."

Tohsaka doesn't interrupt.
It means she intended for the two of us to fight Zouken, no matter what her true opinion may be.

"I can't ignore Zouken, but I can't ignore the shadow either. Tohsaka and I will start patrolling the town tonight, so Sakura and Ilya are to stay here and keep watch."

I confirm the plan with everyone.
Then.

"W-What are you saying, Senpai...!?"
"Sakura...? What? It's nothing ridiculous, right?
 Tohsaka and I are the only ones who can fight, so we have to beat Zouken."

"That's the ridiculous part...!
 You can't use one of your arms anymore! Do you really know what that means...!?"
"EhSakura...?"

"...I don't get it. You're acting strange. Why are you going to fight even after what's happened to you?
 You should know that things are out of your hands now because you actually took part in it. So why are you saying such a ridiculous thing?
 I was relieved because I thought you wouldn't fight with one arm, so why"

"...........Sakura."
Sakura is trembling.
She's hanging her head as she trembles at her words.
I don't know why she's trembling.
The only thing I can do is to answer her question.

"Sakura. I'm going to let you win. That's why I'm fighting.
 Yes, I don't want to ignore Zouken and the shadow. But more than that, I want the Holy Grail.  Nobody's making me do this. This is a selfish wish of mine."

That's right.
It's a selfish wish I had ever since I decided to be Sakura's ally and not everyone else's.

".........Is that for my sake?"
"Yes. It will be for your sake if we can remove the crest worm from your body."

"...It's all right, Sakura. If there's no chance of victory, we'll make a chance, and we won't fight while we don't have any chance of victory.
 There's still danger even if we have a chance, but there's always a risk, so I can't promise you I won't get hurt.
 But I'll definitely come back. I told you I'd protect you, right? So I can't fulfill my promise unless I'm by your side."

"Sen... pai..."
Sakura looks down painfully.
It looks like she's apologizing.

"All right, can you stop it there?
 Our course of action's already determined, so it does no good to whine.
 Sakura and Ilya are to stay here. Shirou and I will patrol the town at night. We won't carelessly attack Zouken even if we find him. We'll chip away at their force only when we have a chance of victory.
That's our future course of action, right, Shirou?"

"Y-Yeah... It'd be great if that's your decision."

"Heh. I don't even need to tell you."

"And, Sakura. Kirei couldn't completely extract your crest worm, but he suppressed its action. So it can't run wild unless they use a drug on you like Shinji did.
 But at the same time, Zouken can't be the winner as long as you stay here in this house. He's going to come take you sooner or later, so refusing to fight is not an option. How can you say you won't do anything knowing that?"

"That may be true, butGrandfather shouldn't do anything rough if we don't do anything"

"Sakura! Stop being so submissive. Zouken isn't your grandfather or your master. Do you still think he's human after all the terrible things he's done to you!?"
".........No. I've never thought he was human."

"Then prepare yourself. Shirou and I will be fighting outside, so you have to fight here too.
 If Zouken attacks this place, you have to get away at any cost. The Holy Grail cannot be completed as long as Rider isn't defeated. You have a hope of being saved as long as Rider's alive."

Tohsaka's voice is firm.
...Is it the dignity of the older sister?
Sakura nods and replies that she understands.
And after that.
I ask why she brought me here to the dojo.

"Let's see. Why don't you get naked to start with?
 No matter what we end up doing, nothing would go right unless I take a look at what kind of a body you have."
And she gives me a ridiculous reply.

"Wha-"
"WHA-WHAAAAAT!?"
"...Whaaat?"
I continue in a small voice because she's more surprised than I am.

"What? Is that such a shock, Sakura?"
"I-It is...! You want Senpai to be naked!? What are you thinking, Tohsaka-Senpai...!?"

"I'm thinking about Shirou, of course.
 You're in danger, but Shirou's also in a lot of danger. You should know too that we have to get a lot of things done now."
"...That's true... but..."

"If you know, then don't butt in.
 Hey there! Don't just stand there and take off your top! I'm going to put on a warding sign, so I can't do it if you keep your shirt on!"
Tohsaka glares at me.

"Ugh......"
But Sakura's stare is painful.
It's uneasily asking me if I'm going to go along with Tohsaka.

"Hurry up. We won't make it before tonight's patrol unless we give your body some time to familiarize itself with it."
"Umm......"

This is no time to be embarrassed about something like this.
I don't want to take my clothes off, but taking off my top is like getting changed, so it shouldn't be a big deal.

"...Man. All right, Tohsaka. So, what do I do now?"
"Come here. I'll transplant a small part of my Magic Crest onto you."
"...! Over there!? You mean like this!?"

"Of course. I have to touch your body with my left hand, comprehend it, and share my warding crest with you. It'll tickle and hurt, but bear with me."
Tohsaka wiggles her fingers.

"Ugh"
...I can't run away after coming this far.
I give up and go near Tohsaka.
...Um, Sakura's stare is more painful now.

"I'm going to start now, but let me confirm beforehand. I said before that I'll put a switch in you, but I won't do that.
 In your state, it's too dangerous to be able to turn your Magic Circuit on and off so easily."

"OOkay, I got it."
I manage to reply with a high-pitched voice.
It's natural that I'm acting strange and can't breathe.
I'm naked, and Tohsaka is near me.
It'd be more strange not to be nervous!

"Hey. You don't seem to be calm. Are you listening to me?"
"I'm listening. I'm listening to you."

"......? All right, then.
 So this operation is to suppress magical energy.
 Your body is unstable right now, and we don't know when Archer's arm might flow magical energy into your body. I'm going to put needles into your left shoulder, belly button, and your throat, so that your left arm won't be connected to you unless you really want it to be."

"This is also a countermeasure against the shadow.
 That thing sucks up magical energy just by being there. The sign I'm going to carve into you will also have resistance to magical energy, so you should be less burdened when facing that thing."
Then, Tohsaka places her hand on my chest.

"Whoa!"
I barely stop myself from jumping back.

"Oh, was it hot? Can you bear it? I'm going to transplant the Magic Crest from my arm, so I can't lower the temperature."
"NoI don't care about it being hot or cold."

Tohsaka's hand is soft, and her touch sends a shudder through my heart.
Every time her slender fingers run across my chest, my temperature rises by a degree.

"......All right. I think I have a grasp of your chest. Next is your belly button, but this is going to hurt. I'm going to put my finger in, so try not to move. Don't worry, it won't injure you, and I won't move it around much."

"Heywhat do you mean by move it, Toh... saka!"
My body convulses.

My stomach.
Having Tohsaka's hand on my stomach is bad enough, but something rigid tears through my skin and into my body!

"Haah-hold on, that's, ba"
"I-I said it's going to hurt. Don't make noises like that, it's distracting. It makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong!"

"A-Are you stupid!?"
My face is going to get redder if you say something like that, you idiot!

"...Humph. I'm done with the belly button. All that's left is your shoulder and throat, so stay calm and don't run away."

"........."
I would really love to run away right now.
I would love to, but doing so would seem like I'm conscious of Tohsaka and I won't be able to excuse myself.

"Come on. I'm going to do the same thing to your shoulder, so suck it up. Grit your teeth and don't make any weird noises."
"OOkay. I'll try my best."
It's embarrassing, so I look away from Tohsaka.

It's not just my face that's blushing.  I think my entire body's turning red.
I'm blushing even though I know this is only for magic, so I bet Tohsaka's having a hard time too.
...Man.
How can I ever face Tohsaka again after committing such a disgrace...?

"All right, that's it. I'm going to put away the equipment, so you go cool yourself off."
Tohsaka grabs something that looks like a first-aid kit and goes to the corner of the dojo, where her bag is.


My face is still red, but I'm finally able to calm down and take a deep breathe.
...Then.

"......?"
Sakura twiddles her fingers, looking like she wants to say something.

"...Sakura? W-What's wrong?"
".........Um, well..."
She takes a look at me.
Then she takes a breath, as if preparing herself...

"Um, Senpai...! W-We, um... made love, right!?"
...And she asks me a ridiculous question.


My face, which had finally calmed down, passes its boiling point and turns red again.

"Ahum."
I feel dizzy.
Just recalling what happened that night is so stimulating that it makes me forget about our current situation.
So for Sakura to ask me fro confirmation like this, when I'm already off-balance from Tohsaka, is like getting hit twice as hard

"Um... Senpai?"

No.
This isn't the time to be speechless.

"Yeah, I did make love to you."
"R-Right!? Then it's strange for you to lose your composure against Nee-san!"

Sakura looks up at me unhappily.
...I finally realize why her stare was so painful earlier. It's because she was sulking.

"I-I'm sorry. But Sakura, this had nothing to do with Tohsaka, and, um, it couldn't be helped."
"I-I know, but please bear with it! You're m-m-my lover!"

"Ugh. I... know that, but..."
I couldn't fight against it.
I'm a guy, and I've admired Tohsaka since I got into this school, so I couldn't help it.

"...I'm sorry. I'll try to bear it next time. I'll do my best not to lose my composure."
"...Really? I'll get mad if this happens again next time."

She stares straight at me.
Repentant from the bottom of my heart, I tell her I'll do my best.

...Man.
I only realized it just now, but...
Having three girls under the same roof might be a really stressful thing.
It's eleven-thirty now.
With lunch coming up, the kitchen is filled with a noisy, forbidding atmosphere.

"Um, Tohsaka-Senpai. I'm thinking of making a dish that everyone can eat from. Do you have anything you don't like?"
In the kitchen...
With the refrigerator at her back, Sakura speaks timidly.

In response...
"I see. Then I'll make mapo tofu."
...Tohsaka cuts her off and selfishly starts cutting the tofu.

"They aren't getting along. What were you thinking, letting them cook?"
Ilya sits Japanese-style on the cushion and speaks without reserve.
Hm. It seems even Ilya can tell Tohsaka and Sakura are tense.

"It's just going to get worse if you leave them be.
 You should know that, so how did you let it come to this?"

"It just sort of happened.
 We were wondering about lunch. Tohsaka said she'd make it, and Sakura said it was her job. Neither one would back down, so I took both their ideas and suggested that they make lunch together."

"You said that? ...I see. No wonder they can't back out now."
Ilya seems to understand and takes a sip of tea with proper manners.
As expected from a princess. She shouldn't know the proper etiquette, but she's elegant even with something as simple as this.

"But Shirou. Couldn't you have made lunch? Why did you get Rin and Sakura to do it?
 Tohsaka and Matou are enemies, and Rin wants to kill Sakura."

"That was only up to yesterday. Tohsaka is working with us because she doesn't want to fight Sakura. And they aren't enemies. They get along, and I entrusted them with lunch because I thought it would go well."

"Huhthey get along!?"
"...? Is that so surprising? Ilya and I are friends even though we were enemies, right? Then it should be the same for Tohsaka and Sakura."
"Eh... Well, Shirou and I are special..."

"Being special has nothing to do with this. You'll understand if you watch. Tohsaka is being more blunt than usual, but she warns Sakura every time she does something wrong. It means that..."
"......She's concerned about her. But she's putting on a cold face and ignoring her because she doesn't want her to find out."

"Right. And Sakura knows that, so she's making mistakes she normally doesn't. She's concerned about Tohsaka too."
"...Now that you point it out, I can see it. Then what? They want to get along, but they're too embarrassed to start talking?"

I nod.
I don't know about Tohsaka, but I know how Sakura feels.

Sakura likes Tohsaka, and she wants Tohsaka to like her.
Or she would never call her Nee-san.

"...I see. So Rin is clumsy, in spite of her appearance."
Impressed, Ilya murmurs and looks in the kitchen.


I follow her example and look in the kitchen.
They must be half done with the cooking.
Standing side-by-side in the small kitchen, Tohsaka and Sakura are making their dishes.



One holds the frying pan while the other holds the ladle, but neither says anything.
...And after a silence that even gets us nervous...

As expected from sisters, they start talking at the same time.

"What? Go ahead, I'll listen to whatever you have to say."
"Oh... um, it's really nothing. Didn't you want to say something?"

"...It's nothing. Well, different people cook differently, right? So I thought it might be useful if you can teach me some of your flavorings."
"Y-You're right. I'd love it if you could teach me your recipes, Tohsaka-Senpai."

"Hm."
"...That's it?  I don't believe this. At this rate, they'll be like that forever."

"......"
It's scary that I can't deny the possibility.
Tohsaka is normally dominant, but why is she so shy when it comes to Sakura?

And Sakura too.
She calls Tohsaka Nee-san when she's with me, but she's reserved when she's actually with her.

"Sakura."
"Huh? Oh, yes, what is it, Senpai?"
"I need to talk to you. Can you come here?"

"Senpai? Is there something outside?"
"No, being outside isn't the important part. I just wanted to talk secretly."

"Um... talk secretly...? Um, is this something you can't let Nee-san hear?"
"That's it. That's exactly what I want to talk about."

"...?"
"I'm talking about how you address Tohsaka. You don't call her Nee-san when you're with her. It's obvious that you really want to call her that."

"Ehyou mean it's obvious to Nee-san!?"
...Whoa.
I just made that up, but it seems Sakura is more reserved about her sister's feelings than I thought.

"N-No, Tohsaka doesn't know. I don't know why, but she's really dense when it comes to you. ...But in the worst case, she might think that you hate her."

"T-That's not true...! It's natural for Nee-san to hate me, but I'm happy to be with her.  I never even dreamed that we could make lunch together..."

"Right. Then why don't you just be honest with her? Even someone as dense as Tohsaka can't possibly miss it if you tell her straight-out. Then you should be able to..."
Sakura should be able to realize by herself that Tohsaka wants to get along with Sakura.

"...Um, Senpai?"
"It's nothing. Just go call Tohsaka Nee-san.
 I'll bet you she changes so much that it's funny."

"...Would it really turn out like that? I think having someone like me calling her 'Nee-san' will only bother her.
 I'm a magus of Matou, and I can't do everything like Nee-san can. Tohsaka-Senpai is probably disappointed that a failure like me is her sister."

"You idiot. Don't bring other things into a sister's relationship. You like Tohsaka, and she's your big sister, right?
 Then there's nothing more important than that. I'll guarantee it. There's mutual love between you two. To be honest, there's so much love that I'm a bit jealous."
"Eh... I-Is that so?"

"Yeah. So you call her Nee-san.
 I think Tohsaka believed in it, just like you did. So there's nothing to be scared of. It's for her sake too. Please call her Nee-san."
"For Nee-san's sake."

...I don't know what's going on in her mind.
But after putting her hands together, as if praying, and thinking it over...
"Okay. I'll do my best."
She smiles softly in thanks.

We return to the living room.
Sakura exchanges a glance with me, takes a deep breath, and heads to the kitchen.

"Welcome back. Sakura's tensed up. What happened?"
"Hm? The rest depends on her courage. Well, I'm sure it's going to go well."
"...?"
I sit down on the cushion.

"Nee-san. Can I finish this fried chicken?"
"Yes, all that's left is to fry it, so I'll leave it to you... wait, Sakura, did you just..."

"Okay. If I'm doing the chicken, can you cut the lettuce, Nee-san? I'll leave the serving to you."
"OOkay, that's fine, but..."

...Everything goes still.
They both fall silent, and the tension is much greater than before.


Not even breathing, they stare at one another.

"......Um, is it strange, Nee-san?"
 "Uhi-it's not that.  I was just surprised because I've never been called that way."
"...Then, um..."

"I-I have nothing against it. You're free to call me whatever you want, and I'm calling you by name. Well, it could get confusing because there are two Senpai here, so that should make things clearer."

Tohsaka makes it sound like it can't be helped and looks away.
...But Sakura should be able to tell that she's blushing and can't hide her smile.

...Their joint work got even more awkward after that.
They messed up so many times that lunch turned out to be a disaster. The fried chicken was covered in pepper, the mapo tofu was hot as hell, and the rice cooker was never turned on, so we ended up eating without rice.
But Tohsaka and Sakura both looked happy, smiling at every opportunity.

"...Geez, they sure are clumsy."
Ilya sounds dumbfounded as she eats mapo tofu that's hot enough to numb your tongue.
I nod back silently and gratefully eat the food they made.
"I'm coming in, Sakura."
He opens the door without waiting for a reply.
He has never waited for his younger sister's reply before opening this door.

"What, she's not home yet? What a slug."
He clucks his tongue and walks into the room.
Scratching at the wall, Matou Shinji wanders through his sister's room like a blind dog.

"Sakura. Are you in the basement again? What're you doing down there, ignoring me?"
He keeps asking questions that will not be answered.
There is no one in the room.
His sister has not been home the past few days.
It is obvious that the master of this room is not here, but Shinji wanders through it all the same.

"It's just like always. Haha, it really is like always!"
He throws the clock that touches his hand.
The sound of shattering glass is more annoying than he thought.

"Where the hell are you? Keeping a secret from your brother? Why the hell is everyone doing as they please...!?"
He starts throwing things like mad.
...This is like always too.
This outlet has been his daily routine for the past few years.
It is his best opposition that began three years ago when he found out the truth.

The Matou bloodline came to an end when he was born.

The noble family lost its power, becoming mere humans.
The only special thing is the accumulated knowledge.
The once noble family of magi is fated to perish in this Far East country.

He has known this since he was young.
The Matou family was a family that passed down secret techniques.
But it is all in past tense now.
As the Matou are no longer able to use magic, they are to blend into society as ordinary people.

But he did not think so.
Their Magic Circuit faded away, leaving them unable to perform their secret techniques.
The bloodline of magi ended for Matou in his father's generation, and he knows that he does not have the right to succeed the Matou name.
But the Matou family still has the records.
The bloodline perished, but the accumulated knowledge is not lost.

That itself is "special" enough for the boy.
He thinks he is different from others.
The Matou family have been chosen.
That will not change, even if they lose their power and cease to be magi.
He was proud of himself because he was born into a special family to be raised in a special way.
Even if he is a failure as a magus, he is a child born into the chosen family.

...But a new child slipped into the chosen family.
His father adopted a girl who had none of her own.
It all happened more than ten years ago.
The girl named Sakura became his little sister from that day on.

At first, he hated his new sibling.
He did not want any outsiders coming into the special Matou household.
But the boy started to accept his sister day by day.
The girl named Sakura was silent and ordinary, no more capable than a guard dog.
It is a waste of time to be hostile against someone like that, and it is more charming if one is to consider her a servant.

He looked through books, memorizing magic he could not use, to remind himself that he was the Matou heir.
He was the only one who could enter the study.
His adopted sister could never be named the successor, so she had no right to trespass there.
His sister would live as a normal human being, never being taught the family's surviving knowledge.
This fact greatly satisfied his pride.

A family of magi has only one successor.
He knew that, so he did not question their separate upbringings.
Only one could learn magic.
Then it was only natural that his sister be raised apart.

Yes.
He felt sympathy for his sister.
They lived in the same house and had the same parents, but he was the only one who could call himself special, and he pitied his sister for not being chosen.
It is like a compassion of a superior being looking down onto othersand it is his most reliable pride.

The brother treated his sister as a failure.
The sister feared her brother and always looked down, as if avoiding his gaze.
He thought it was because of shame, and he despised and loved her for it at the same time.
Until he found out the truth.

"What?"

That was all he could manage when he accidentally found the room.

A room he has never been told about.
Knowledge that was not taught to him.
Talent that was not given to him.
Everything was in the room.
A naked girl lay in the middle of the room.
Around her were swarms of black worms and his terrifying grandfather.
And his father glared at the boy as if he was a nuisance, an attitude he had never taken towards him.

And that ended it.
Everything he believed in, everything that constructed him was turned upside-down.

It was not him that was special.
It was not his sister that was kept at a distance.
It was not her that was pitiable.
And it was not her that was looking down on the other person

His life completely changed.
Since he no longer needed to hide anything, his father took a defiant attitude towards his son.  He started spending more time with the boy's sister instead.
His sister did not say anything, but would just hang her head like always.
She still acted as though running away from his gaze when she would say...
"I'm sorry, Nii-san."
...As if pitying him. She said it with the emotion that he once felt for his sister.

"HaHaha, hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!"

He laughed.
It was funny.
It was so funny that he wanted to kill.
The one he had thought was his pet was actually his master, and he was just a fool.
Which one is the funny one?
It must be both.
At that time, as he went back to the mansion with unsteady steps, he realized.

The world had not been turned upside-down.
It had been like this all along.
The inverted onethe one who was misunderstood was him.
It is just that he finally realized his own miserableness.

The three years after that were only pain for him.
His father died, and his grandfather only cared about Sakura.
Matou Shinji became just like air in his house.
He was treated as an object whose existence did not matter, and that truly was the case.

She pitied the air.
She apologized.
Though she never spoke the words aloud, she apologized every time she saw him.
She apologized for taking Matou Shinji's place.

   "Why are you apologizing?"

She could've just ignored him.
Then he wouldn't have hated her, wouldn't have clung to hope.
Sakura apologized.
Apologizing means submitting something.
Then

  "Then you're mine from now on."

Considering all the contempt he had endured, he saw nothing wrong in accepting this.

"Hahis she still over at Emiya's?
 Even though she's the successor of Matou. Even though she's the successor of Matou. Even though she's the successor of Matou!"

The room shows no signs of life.
But that is to be expected.
Matou Sakura's "room" is the underground worm's nest, and this is merely for show.
The master of the room does not care how much he breaks the things in this room.
This room is no different from the doorplate that hangs at the entrance.

"Yeah, but you still apologize...! 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'...!? Don't disobey me if you think you're sorry...! If you feel guilty, keep compensating for it! If you know you've been sold out to this house, be mine...!"
He scratches the sheets.
Something that was his.
Why did a doll that did not think or resist leave him?

"You took her. You took her, Emiya."
That was his miscalculation.
He knew she was attracted to Emiya Shirou.
That thing that held no interest in anything started to say things after getting to know him.
She gradually regained herself, and in the end, she betrayed him.

He trained her to never disobey him, but now she chooses a total stranger over her own brother

"That's why I said it wasn't safe to have her over at Emiya's. But that old bastard spouted some bullshit about keeping watch on that house!"
His grandfather does not even try to take Sakura back.
He said it is fine as is, and moreover, confined him to this house.

"You watch. I'm going to make you pay for this, Sakura. You should never disobey me"
...That's right.
If a doll is disobedient, he'll just reset the relationship to be like it was before.
If she gained hope to become human...

"...Yeah. I just have to destroy her hope again, just like before."
He laughs.
The clouded window reflects a face as ghastly as a skull.
It's afternoon now.
Tohsaka seems busy and Sakura's sleeping, so I should make dinner.
My left arm moves even though it reacts slow, so it shouldn't hinder me if I'm to make something simple.

"Hmm... I guess I can make fried swordfish and simmered meat and potato."
I check the contents of the refrigerator and decide the menu.
There are two additional people eating now, so the food gets used up quickly.
I should find some time to go to the shopping district tomorrow.

"Itadakimasu!"
Everyone must've liked having dinner ready when they came here, since they all seem to be in a good mood.

I'm worried that Rider isn't here, but I'm sure she has her reasons.
Her top priority is guarding Sakura. So maybe she has no intention of spending time around Tohsaka, who may end up being her enemy.

"...Will Rider come eat later on?"
I'll pack it up and take her some if she doesn't come.
Rider seems to like desolate places, so I bet she's either in the dojo or the shed.

"Oh, so you're good at this? Sakura's good at Western food and you're good at Japanese food?"

Tohsaka picks up the fried swordfish and looks at me in surprise.
It's golden fried with a scent of ginger, with an elegant soy sauce taste. She seems to really like it.

"I like this one better. I'm glad you're good at cooking."
Ilya eats the potatoes in satisfaction.
...It's unfortunate that she's only eating the "potato" part of the "simmered meat and potato", but I'm glad she likes it.

...Wait.
Sakura is tilting her head in confusion, chopsticks in hand.

"Sakura? What's wrong? You don't have any appetite?"
"...Oh... Um, I do, but Senpai?
 The simmered meat and potato doesn't have any sugar in it. It tastes strange."

"What!?"
I-I made such a stupid mistake on something I'm so used to cooking...!?

"Damn, hold on...!"
I serve myself out of the big dish in the center and try some.

"...Hm?"
.........That's strange.
This tastes normal.

"Sakura. Does this taste weird?"
"Weird? Didn't you use salt instead of sugar?
 I don't taste anything sweet..."

"Really? Isn't it supposed to taste this way? Well, it does taste different because there's something in it to bring out the flavor. But this is something you can't readily copy and make."
"I don't know since this is the first time I've had this dish, but it's good. It's sweet and easy to eat."

Sakura looks dissatisfied as she reaches out for seconds.
...One bite, two bites, three bites.
"Sakura...?"

"Huh? Oh, it seems I ate a piece that wasn't simmered. I'm sorry I said something weird. Your food is good like always."
Sakura smiles and keeps eating.

"............"
Sakura keeps eating like nothing happened.
I was worried by Sakura's odd behavior, but she seemed well enough after that.
In fact, she asked for seconds three times.
Sakura kept eating and finished off the food while Tohsaka stared at her in surprise.
It's past ten o'clock.
"It's about time. Let's get going, Shirou."
Tohsaka finishes preparing and appears.
"I know. Please watch the house while we're gone, Sakura."

Tohsaka and I head out to patrol the town as planned.
...It's stupid that this is our only measure against Zouken, but it's all we can do for now.

We need to defeat Zouken, Assassin, Saber, and the black shadow.
...They aren't ones we can defeat head on.
We have to sit tight until the countermeasure Tohsaka is preparing is completed.

But we can't just stay at my house.
According to the news this morning, Matou Zouken has started to attack ordinary people.
We can't match them right now, but we should at least patrol the town so that there won't be more victims.

"......"
"......"
We put our shoes on silently.
We know how dangerous it is to go out into town at night.
Zouken is only after Sakura, but we should get in his way if we're walking about.
...In the worst case, it'll be a repeat of our encounter in the forest.
Considering that, we can't be talking lightheartedly.

"...Hey. What are you doing?"
Then.
We don't have anything to spare, but Tohsaka glares at me and

"You don't need to see us off. Go back to your room, Sakura."
"......"
No, she's not glaring at me.
She's glaring at Sakura, who is standing in the hallway.

"N-Nee-san. I'll go too. It's dangerous for you two to go out alone, so..."
"Sakura."
...That must be why she's here.
I appreciate her concern. but our plan is already determined.

"No. You should know you're Zouken's target. Please stay here with Ilya and protect yourself."

"I know. But you can only use one arm, Senpai. And Nee-san doesn't have a Servant, so..."
"Don't be ridiculous, Sakura. It doesn't change the fact that you're our enemy. I can't trust you with my back when I don't know when you'll turn into Zouken's puppet."

"...But, Nee-san."
"You just concentrate on protecting yourself. If you feel sorry for us, please don't trouble us about this. Just let Rider protect you and Ilya."

"Tohsaka, youwhoa, hey...!"
"Hey, don't just stand there. Let's get going. While we stand around, he could be out there attacking somebody else."
Tohsaka grabs my hand and drags me outside.

"Ohjust be careful and watch the house, Sakura...! I'll leave Ilya to you...!"
I leave with Tohsaka pulling at me.

"........."
Sakura doesn't say anything and stands at the entrance, lonely.

"Hey, wait, Tohsaka! I'll follow you, so let go of me already!"
"Humph. It's your fault for being slow."
Tohsaka lets go and comes to a halt.

"...What's with that face? If you have something to say, then spit it out."
And it's like this all of a sudden.
Tohsaka is acting defiantly.
...Man.
If it bothers her that much, she shouldn't have said it in the first place.

"...Man. Then I'm saying it, Tohsaka. It's about what happened now, but don't say such things to Sakura. Sakura isn't like that because she wants to be."

"I know. But that's why I have to be firm with her. If we aren't, Zouken will be sure to take advantage."

"...This is a good opportunity, so let me straighten this out. I don't feel any sympathy towards Sakura.
 It doesn't concern me if she's Zouken's puppet, and I have nothing to do with what happened to her after she was adopted to the Matou family. It does no good for me to say anything about her problem."

"Tohsaka."
"Look. I'm at your house not because Sakura is there, but because you're there.
 My goal is not to save Sakura, but to obtain the Holy Grail.
 I'll keep watch on Sakura for that goal, and I don't care even if she hates me for it. That's why I'll say things like that, and I'm going to keep treating her as my enemy."

"...So it won't bother you at all if she hates you? Her feelings don't matter because she's a complete stranger?"
"That's right. Do you have any complaints?"
"You idiot. Of course I do."

...Man, this is not like Tohsaka.
She should be able to say it like it's nothing.  Instead, she's clenching her fists like she's trying to convince herself.

"All right. If you want to act that way, then go ahead.
 Sakura knows how you feel, no matter what kind of attitude you take towards her."

"Huhwhat do you mean by that!?"
"I'm talking about how important Sakura is to you. I'm an outsider and I notice it, so it should be obvious to her."

"That's a misunderstanding. I just..."
"There's nothing to misunderstand. People can't get seriously mad about things they don't care about. You're strict to Sakura for a reason. You don't say it, but she's still your precious sister."
"WWhat are you saying, you idiot!!? Stop saying such snobby things!!!!"

Tohsaka's face turns red with anger.
But I don't feel the usual intensity, and I know why.

"Oh? Was it a bother?"
"It is a bother. Isn't it obvious?"

"I see. Then while I'm at it, I have something else to say. I want you and Sakura to get along. She likes you, and you like her. So I don't like it when it's this awkward between you two."

"...Hey now. She has to be my enemy. Making friends with her now won't do any good.  I wouldn't even know where to start."
"Isn't it fine as is? Have confidence in yourself, Tohsaka. Even I can tell that you're being a good big sister."

"E-Enough with the chatting! We're going to the place they showed in the news this morning!"
Tohsaka looks away and starts to walk.
I reply to her absent-mindedly and follow.
Then.

"Shirou."
She calls my name without looking at me and...
"Um, thanks. That made me, um... happy."
Tohsaka grumbles, embarrassed.

...There's nobody at the central park.
The park that's deserted even during the day is even quieter after the murder yesterday.
The park is not a place for relaxation within the business district, and it is no different from a desert in an uncultivated land.

"...A murder, huh? It seems people are treating it as an accident rather than a murder case. Well, I guess you really can't call it murder when you can't tell who died and what the missing body parts are."

I still see traces of blood on the grass.
...It looks like a bucketful was spilled in four separate areas.
The darkened patches have some distance between them, probably because the victims frantically tried to escape.

"Tohsaka. You said this might be Zouken's doing, but what do you think now? Do you still think so after coming here?"

"......Let's see. I thought it might be the black shadow's doing, but it doesn't seem that way.
 All the mana in the area would be swallowed if that thing had appeared. But the magical energy here isn't exhausted. ...Well, I still think the incident here was an unexpected meal."

That's all the information we can get out of this place.
Tohsaka and I leave the site of the tragedy behind us.

...We didn't find anything in Shinto.
Maybe Zouken is not active tonight, probably because the incident yesterday was so vivid.

The date's about to change.
A riverside breeze blows as we trudge home.
And...
"Tohsaka. Sakura is the successor of Matou, right?"
I suddenly feel like asking the question that was on my mind for a while.

"Why are you asking that now? I have nothing to hide."
"No, that's not what I meant. If she's the successor, that means she's a magus, right? So I'm wondering what kind of magic she uses."
"Oh, I see now."

"...Yeah, I hear Matou's magic is in bindings and coercions. I also hear that the Command Spell wouldn't have been possible without Matou."

"Oh. So Sakura's magic is restriction? But then..."
On that day...
The magic Sakura used when the crest worm tortured her must have been Rider's power.

"......I don't think it's restriction. That's the Makiri's forbidden magic, and it's not their strong point.
 But it's meaningless to think about it. Sakura doesn't have the magical energy to use magic. The crest worm will feed on such excess energy first, so she shouldn't be able to use magic."

"...I see, that's good. So, how good is Sakura in your eyes? Is she about as good as you, considering she's the Matou successor?"
"We have about the same number of Magic Circuits.
 Did you forget that we're sisters?"

"Oh."
That's right.
That's why they wanted to adopt her in the first place.

"Oh, so she's about as good as you?"
"I don't think so. My attribute is 'five elements', and hers is 'imaginary element'. But the Matou family has a water attribute, so they changed her by force. What do you think would happen to a bird that has a potential to fly if it's put in water?"

"It'll die, or..."
"Yes. Adapting to the water would be all it could do.
 She would've had great success as a magus of Tohsaka, but she's no different from you because she was forced to change into a magus of Matou.
 No, you're much stronger than her because you train your body."

"Then let's say you and Sakura fought using magic..."
"I'd win ten times out of ten.  With her magical energy capacity, Sakura would never get past my barrier."

...I see.
I couldn't figure out what kind of magus Sakura is, but I got to know their power balance.
Tohsaka isn't one to bluff, so she must be speaking the truth.

"...But I'm embarrassed. I never knew Sakura was a magus, and I don't know how good she is. I'm a dumbass for pretending to be her guardian all this times."
"Hey now. The crest worm eats the magical energy in her, so you'd never know she's a magus even if you're by her all the time."

"...And she did her best not to let you know. So don't say such a thing in front of her, okay?"

"............"
She doesn't even need to tell me.
Sakura is Sakura, even if she is a magus.
First of all, I'm not that skillful.
No matter who Sakura may really be, I can only treat her like I always have.

"You're right. If you say so, I'll just treat her the same as always.
 I won't even think about asking for her help as a magus. That's fine with you, right?"

"Of course. If you were going to rely on Sakura, I would've taken her to my house."

Tohsaka's kindness makes my heart jump.
...See.
Tohsaka really is a good sister.

"But I don't think that's possible. Sakura smiles when she's at your house. If you talk about surprising, that's what surprised me the most."
Then.
A look of happiness on her face, she says something odd.

"Smile? But Sakura, is, um..."
She's always like that.

"Yeah, it was needless worry on my part.
 I can't talk to her that much, so I watched her. I went to the archery club every day after she started coming to our school."

"Yeah, I know that, but..."
"...Yeah. And I realized after a while that she never smiled."


That's...
...Something I'm hearing for the first time, but I can't deny what she's saying.
Come to think of it, Sakura always looked gloomy at school.

"Well, the only exception was when you were there.
 She smiled whenever you came to the archery club.
 In short, Sakura's only cheerful when you're in front of her."

"......"
Her words should make me happy.
But...
"...Sakura doesn't smile in front of people?"
...They seem to hide a dangerous truth.
It's past one o'clock when I return to my room.

"Phew."
I sit down on my futon.
Our patrol yielded nothing.
All we did was confirm that this morning's news was real.

"......"
Enemies we must defeat.
Just thinking about them sends cold, nauseous feelings through me.

Even a human could match Zouken or Assassin.
But those two are different.
I don't even know if the black shadow has a concept of death, and Saber is someone we don't even stand a chance against.
Butas long as there are victims, we can't just ignore them saying we can't beat them.

"...Archer's arm, huh?"
I put my hand on the red cloth.
...I have a weapon.
I don't know how far this will get me, but I do have a weapon.
The question is if I can manage it, and if my body can withstand it.

".........I guess a bit is fine."
I untie the knot on the red cloth.
The cloth loosens up, and blood flows into my arm.

    At that instant.
    I think I heard a beast's howl.

I'm stabbed.
My whole body is pierced.
Is this pain? If this is pain, then the pain I've experienced until now isn't pain.

It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.
The floor's ruggedness. The softness of the futon hurts. It feels like I'm sitting on a mountain of swords. The air is poisonous, and I die three times as I breathe it in. Birds are chirping in the distance. The wind is strong. There's no moisture. My skin dries and turns into sand. Flowing, scouring, crumbling.

Tongs are inserted from the hollowed holes.
Thirty-two enter where my shoulder used to be.
They carefully, accurately, and elaborately pierce my internal jugular vein, trachea, spinal cord, sympathetic nervous system, lobus superior pulmonis, lobus medius pulmonis dextri, lobus inferior pulmonis, main artery, heart, diaphragm, spleen, stomach, liver, gall bladder, and colon.

"Ah!"
It's crumbling.
Time slows to an impossible crawl. 
I see sixty-trillion cells crumbling apart at the rate of three four naught per second.

", "
There is no pain.
There is no pain.
There is no pain.
There is only fear.
The end roll invades with amazing speed.
The flashback stops with fantastic image.
Death before my eyes, death past me, death at the moment, the pain is not physical, but only the explosion of negation every time death is thrown at me
"Haa, ah.........!"
...I hear a sound.
The sound of my head striking the floor.

"AhAh."
...My eyes are hot.
I realize I've been crying.

"AhAhh, ah."
Desperately, I stifle the scream building in my throat.
I curl up, push my head against the floor, grab my left arm with my right hand, and just cry.

"AhAhh, ah"
I'm scared.
The thing I've been missing since the fire ten years ago.
I'm scared.
A natural fear for any living thing.
I'm scared.
For the first time in my life, I want to run away from my end.

"Haaaa."
It's not because dying will hurt.
It's not because I want to live.
It's just because it fills me with dread.

"Ah...... Kuh."
I tie up the red cloth.
I tie the knot tight, so that it'll never come loose again.

"No. This isn't good."
I groan and cry.
The priest said I'll die if I use my left arm.
That's nonsense.
I'll die if I take this cloth off.
My body might be able to bear it, but my mind will die.

My consciousness crumbled away when I loosened the cloth and my shoulder touched the outside air.
I could not bear it.  I cannot live without this cloth.

No.
If this arm is a contradictory existence that people should not associate with, 
 my body, its death foretold, runs to the terminal station, 
the ship, with a crack in the bilge, can only sink into the ocean depths, 
the passengers unaware, too late for anything

".........Ah"

    My breath is running wild.

"Ah, guh."

    I had a bad dream.

...I wipe the sweat off my forehead.
I can't stand up.
I stay cowered, bearing the strange pain.

"Ugh"
...I can't remember.
My left arm hurts.
It hurts so much that I want to cut it off.
I try to recall why it hurts, but I can't remember how to recollect anything in the past.

"Hm"
The pain goes away.
I gather up my consciousness.
It must be because I was asleep.
The dispersed memories look as if they can be cooked nicely, just like chopped onions.
See, I can add color with soy sauce, add flavor with pepper, and add some potato starch to complete the dish.

"Whoathat sounds nasty."
I murmur to myself.
My head is good for nothing, but I can still manage to come up with a conclusion.
In short, I don't have to eat something that's not good.

My left arm is already gone.
Nobody relies on something that's not there.
Therefore, Emiya Shirou has no weapon.
This foreign body is something I must suppress using all my life, and will contaminate me for the rest of my life.

".........!"
Suppressing it with the cloth is meaningless.
If I want to rid myself of this poison, there is only one way.
", "
But I still hold on to my left arm.

A gun is pointed at my forehead.
An image of a trigger.
The trigger is my left arm.
Once pulled, the gun will fire, blowing my brains from my skull.

"......"
I shudder.
I hold my breath and stare at the white wall.

"........."
Clutching my arm, I lie down.
...I close my eyes.
My whimpering finished, I decide to get some sleep for tomorrow.
...A small sound.
I awaken to the sound of footsteps.


I wake up my dozing mind.
It's almost two o'clock.
...It hasn't even been thirty minutes since I fell asleep.
I get up, still unconsciously holding on to my left arm.

"Sakura."
Outside the room.
I call out to the hallway where the footsteps came from.
It's not that I know who's there.
I just thought Sakura might be there.

"..........."
......The door opens.
Sakura steps through into my room.


Biting her lip in embarrassment, she looks down as if unsure of what to say.

"......I'm sorry, Senpai. I, again..."
Sakura apologizes.

But I'm the one who should apologize.

The reason why Sakura's here.
I know well enough the pain she has to go through.
The crest worm feeds on her magical energy, so Sakura periodically needs to receive more from a magus.

"I'm sorry. I should've gone to see you as soon as I came home. I'm sorry for making you suffer."

I get up.
...What was I thinking?
I was so caught up with my left arm that I forgot about Sakura. I can't be forgiven even if I apologize.

"Um, Senpai...?"
"Yeah, I want to make love to you, if that's all right with you."
I use my left arm to pull her to me.
I want to take the lead to make up for forcing her to come to me.

"Ohwhoa."
"S-Senpai...!? Are you all right...!?"
"Oh, it's nothing. I just felt a bit dizzy."

Damn, that's pitiful!
I unconsciously used my left arm and was reminded of the pain.
Still, it shouldn't hurt so long as I have the cloth on, so what am I frightened about?

"...Oh, I have to take my clothes off. Can you take yours off too, Sakura?"
I shake off the dizziness and look at her.
...Then.

"Oh... S-Senpai...! I have a suggestion...!"
I don't know if she's happy or nervous, but Sakura says something strange.

"...? Suggestion?"
"Oh, yes. You're tired from the patrol, right?"

"............Hm."
...How should I answer?
I can't deny it because I really am tired, but I'm not tired enough to not have sex with Sakura.
Actually, I want to have sex even if I am tired.

"...Um, I'm tired. I'm tired, but I still want to make love to you.
 So you don't have to be concerned about me.
 ...Well, you came all the way here, so don't stop now."

I'm ready to go.
I'll be troubled all night if Sakura stops now.

"Yes, so I have a suggestion. I'm sure you're tired, so let me start off."
"?"
Sakura smiles.
I nod, even though I have no idea what she's talking about.


I gulp.
...At Sakura's request, I'm still standing.
...On the other hand...
Sakura is naked and on her knees in front of me.

"...Hm... It's already hard"
"...Sakura, are you really-"
"...Yes. It's all right, Senpai. I can make you feel good."
Sakura takes my half-erect dick and gently holds it up.

I feel her breath on my crotch.
"!"
My dick expands.
I get nervous and excited.
I never thought I'd feel Sakura's breath on my penis.

    "Hm... Ah."

Sakura's tongue touches my half-erect penis.
"...Ah... Hm, mm, mm..."
Something rough touches my head.
A needle-like sensation lances into me from the tip.
She only licked me, but it feels like she's caressing my whole back.

"Ah, ha... hm, hm... hm, how is it, Senpai...?"

......She doesn't need to ask...!
Sakura traces my penis with her tongue, as if savoring the taste.
Her tongue crawls across my member.
Feeling the faint sensations, it instantly arches up.

"Kya...! Oh... it's so hard..., hm... I have to hold on to it..."
My meat stands erect, almost touching my navel.
But Sakura takes it and pulls it down.
She gently grasps it with her slender fingers and puts the head in her mouth.

"Hm... kuh, hm...! Ah, hm, ah, it's so big... hm... my mouth is numb..."
Sakura's tongue rolls around my tip as if licking on something sweet.

"!"
I can't hold it back and I start to let out my pre-cum.
"Ah... You're starting to feel good, Senpai... Hm, hm, nn, ah"
She drinks it down.
Sakura licks my urethra and moves her tongue carefully over my head.

The juice keeps spilling from me.
She licks behind my shaft, my head, and even my rims.

"Hmm... ku, hm... fu, hm..."
...I'm already hard.
My nervousness is gone now.

"Ahnit twitched again... Aha... It feels good, right...?"

She licks it with familiarity.
Her lips press against my tip.
Her fingers gently stroke my sensitive genitals.
Her thick tongue tickles me, but stimulates me at the same time.

"!"
My penis enlarges in response to Sakura's tongue.
It stands fully erect, clear liquid dripping from it.
And...

"Ah, hm, haa...! Oh, it's so much... It's like it's crying... it's so"
'Cute'.
Sakura kisses and drinks from it.

"Hm... hm... ah, hm"
She gulps audibly.
The stimulation from her red tongue doesn't cease.
"...Hm, fu, ah, is it here, Senpai...?"
...This is how Sakura feels towards me.
She caresses me with sweet kisses.
She touches me as if touching something dear and tender.

"Ah, fu... Yes, I'll do my best... so... please feel better..."
Her touch is not intense, but full of deep affection.

"...Sakura..."
There's no way her careful movements wouldn't feel good.
Sakura doesn't move her face because she's only licking the tip.
Her hot breath hits my fired member.

"...Ha... Nha, ha... Haa, hm..."
Her ragged breaths.
Sakura breathes, her shoulders moving up and down.
The slight movement causes her large breasts to shake.

Her soft touch, her sensual body.
Heat starts to gather in my testicles.

"Hm...! ...You're feeling good, right? Hm, it's moving... Aha, it's like it's alive."
She laughs innocently.
...Did she feel my desire?
She runs a finger playfully along the vein.

"Heythat's..."
"Oh...? You don't like it...? ...Fufuthen I'll do this."
She pushes on my shaft, making rhythmical sounds.
She pushes her fingers as if pushing on a pressure point.

"Kuh"
The soft pleasure takes a sudden change.
"Amazing... There's more... ahh, hm... hm..."
...Sakura licks up the juice with her tongue.
In its place, her saliva drips down her lips.

"AhnI'm getting wet. Hm, hm... Is this better for you...?"
Sakura wipes it with her hands and uses it to wet my member.
She takes her slick hand and slides it across my shaft.

"Ah!"
The sensation.
My penis is wet with liquid from Sakura's mouth.

"Am... hm, fuh... Hm, hmm... Ahh... hm..."
Sakura licks it and kisses my head.
"Hm, uh...... Nha, ah, fuh...!"
Maybe she can't breathe out her mouth because it's filled with my penis.
Air blows out of her nose and along my organ.

"......Sakura, I"
I want to let it out.
Sakura's only sucking the tip, so the stimulation isn't that strong.
It's a nice sensation, and my body could bear it if I wanted to.

"Hm, ah, Senpai...?"
"Ha!"
But my mind is at its limits.
"Sakura, I..."
I reach out to her shoulders.

"Hm... You're coming, Senpai? ...Please leave it to me... I'll let you finish off."
She puts the tip in her mouth.
"!"
She surrounds my tip, lightly nibbles on it, and gives me the stimulation I want.

"HmHm, mm......!"
She sucks hard.
Her tongue rolls around the rim.
The rough top of her tongue and the slippery bottom of her tongue attack me continuously!

"...! No, Sakura, I'm coming...!"
"Hm, okay... Please let it out, Senpai"
Sakura pulls her mouth away.
I'm about to explode.
She grabs the root of my shaft and squeezes the cum out of me.

"!"
"HmHm, hm"
My cum surges out.
Sakura opens her mouth and catches my cum.

"...Ha, ahit's still coming out... hm... You're still hard, Senpai"
Her fingers slide across my shaft.
She strokes it, trying to squeeze out what's left inside.

"Ah..."
"Hm... hm... Did it feel good, Senpai...?"
Sakura drinks my cum with an expression of ecstasy.
...She looks lascivious and beautiful at the same time.
The thick liquid drips down her chin and her breasts.
Smiling, she lets it run down her body.

"Sakura."
It's not enough.
I want to drive Sakura crazy.
"Hm......... Senpai...?"
I grab her hand and pull her to my futon.

"Let's continue. I want to put it in you so that I can feel you."
I embrace her hot body.

"...Okay. If you're doing it, Senpai."
Sakura leans against me, accepting my offer.
...My penis is still rock hard.
My lusts won't go away with just one orgasm.
I can only think about following my instinct and piercing it in Sakura.

"Eh...? On top of you...?"
"Yeah, you're doing it today, right? Just spread your legs and move yourself."

I lie down and have Sakura come on top of me.
I didn't have anything specific in mind.
I just thought I'd be able to connect deeper with her this way.

".........Um, like this...?"
Sakura puts her knees on the floor and sits over my crotch.
Sakura looks like she feels awkward being on top, but all that's left is to drop her body.

"...Um, Senpai. I..."
"It's all right. I won't do anything until you get comfortable. You can move at your own pace."
".........Okay. If you say so."
Sakura nods uneasily and slowly lowers herself.

"Hmm, it's here, right...?"
She takes ahold of me and guides me into her.
The tip touches her slit with a wet sound.
She must be aroused already.
It's so wet that there's no need to caress it.

"Ah!"
She holds my penis and pushes it into her.

"Ha, ahnha......!"
She must not be able to adjust her height, as half my penis is inserted in one breath.

"Sakura, put your strength in your legs."
I grit my teeth and try to bear the sudden pleasure as I direct Sakura.

"Oh, yes... You're right..."
She must be nervous, as her walls are different from before.
They still wrap warmly around me, but they don't squeeze.
It seems Sakura doesn't have the composure to concentrate on her hips.

"Sakura...? You have to lower yourself."
"...Oh, okay..."
But she doesn't.
She just looks away awkwardly.

 "What's wrong? Is there a reason you can't?"
"U-Um... It's because... you can see everything in this position..."

That's what's causing Sakura to get nervous.
Embarrassment and hesitation.
She caressed my penis so intently, but it seems having her vagina seen is embarrassing.

"It's fine. I want to see everything.
 I got into this position so that I can feel you the most."
I reach out.
I wrap my arms around her waist so that I can ease her nervousness.

"......! Y-You said you won't move, Senpai...!"
"Yeah, I won't move if you do it. Come on, lower your hips if you don't want me to move."
"......Hm... You're mean, Senpai."
Sakura sighs and closes her eyes as if to bear the embarrassment.

"...Hm... Ahh... ah, hm...!"
She slowly lowers herself.
As she said, I can see everything from here.

Sakura's weight causes my penis to penetrate deeply into her.
I can clearly see her slit and her clit showing underneath her pubes.
It's wet between us, and she's overflowing with her desires.

"Hm... This is certainly embarrassing. Did you have an orgasm back then?"
"Ah... ah... No...! I-I only started feeling good after being in this position...!"

She gives a cute excuse as she keeps lowering herself.
She must have wanted it so bad that she can't stop herself now.

"Ha, hm...! No, Senpai's looking, but I want it in deeper"
Her knees completely bend.
Sakura's soft butt touches my thighs.

"Ah... ha... hm, haa... ah... It's all in, Senpai"

Is it painful to have all of it inside?
Sakura breathes out and tries to bear the foreign substance within her.

"...All right. Then lift yourself up now. Keep moving until you get used to it."
"...Hm... All right. I'll keep moving, Senpai."
She slowly lifts herself.
My penis is gradually exposed to the outside air.

"...Haa... Haa, haa, ah...!"

It doesn't take long for Sakura's body to accept it.
She moves up and down.
The slow movement slowly speeds up.

"Fua, ha, hm! Haa... Senpai, this is scary...!"
...Sakura's breaths heat up along with her body.
Her figure.
A woman is shaking while breathing heavily.
Just watching Sakura's voluptuous body pours gasoline onto the flames of my desire.

"!"
I'm beginning to forget about my promise not to move until Sakura gets used to it.
But my penis pulsates before anything.

"Ah, ha...! Ah, it's hitting me, it's coming in, ha, fua!"
My meat pushes inside of her.
As its arched back, it pushes up on her stomach.
"Hm... Ah, my stomachah, hah...! Amazing, it's so full...!"
She must like it as she starts to move faster.

"Kuh... haa...! Ah... ahh...! Hm, it's deeper than before...!"
"Guh"
She'll pull me in at this pace.
My reasoning will be burned by Sakura's hot walls.

"Ah... hah, ahh...! It's heavy, and I can't stop my butt...!"

This position gives me too much pleasure.
My penis goes in and out like last time, but the sensation is different.
Is it because she's on top of me?
Sakura's body is more sensual than last time, and she seems to be wetter.

"Sakura"
The feel of her weight on me is so lovely that I reach out unconsciously.

"Hm... Your hand, Senpai...!"
I cover her breasts with my hands.

"I'm so gladplease touch them... Please squeeze them, touch them as you like...!"
Her breasts are soft, yet firm.
Letting my male instincts take over, I dig my fingers into her breasts and fondle her hard nipples with my thumb.

"Hya...! Ah, mm!"
Her body arches back.
I circle her areola and roll her nipples between my fingers.
"Haa... ah, haa... Do my breasts feel good...?"
Her pink nipples grow still harder.
Sakura's body grows even hotter.

"Ah, hm...! Ah, it feels good...! Please feel it, Senpai!"
Her butt moves in a rhythm.
...The love juice starts to fill the air with an obscene smell.
My crotch is damp with her fluids, dripping down with every movement.

"...Ah, haa, ahno, Senpaii can't hold it any longerI can't stop my hips...!"
Sakura puts her hands down on my chest.
Her walls were only accepting me until now.
But suddenly, it's like it was the last time.

"Kuh...!?"
She undulates inside.
The honey pot that only accepted me until now suddenly starts to attack the foreign body.

The numerous walls surround me, entangle me, and suck on me.
It's moving in a complex manner, but it still only gives me pleasure.
It reminds me of a carnivorous plant, slowly digesting its prey.

"Hm, fua, ah.. mm, ah...! Ahh... this is good...!"
"Sakura..."
Sakura's hair tosses as she moans.
Her love juice helps the rubbing friction, urging to move faster.

"Kuh...!"
"Ah... hm...! Amazingit's driving into me...!"

", "
I'm pushing my hips up before I know it.
Did Sakura drive me to do it, or did she start to go crazy because I started to push my hips up?
We move apart and collide like magnets.

"Ah, hm, ahh...! Ahh, ahh, oh, ah, haa...!"
Sakura's body shakes in response to the thrusts.
She takes it with all her body, begging for me to go deeper still.

The tip hits the ceiling.
The wet walls protest, but accept me, and the hundreds of walls caress the tip.

"Ah, ahh...!!! It's deep in me...!
 You're deep in me!"

"Guh!"
The semen reaches my urethra, waiting for its release.
If I can, I want to let it all out.
Not only my semen, but every liquid within my body.

"Ah, ah"
It's abnormal.
She feels too good.
Her body sucks on me, as if trying to devour my whole penis.
The pleasure is limitless.

"AhAh, haa!! I can't put power in my body... Senpai, I can't stay up, ahh, haa...!"

"Sakura...!"
I support my falling body with my hands.
I can't bear it either.
I can't bear it, but I can hold on a bit.
Sakura's calling out to me, so I want to finish together.

"AhI'm gladyou're coming inSenpai, I'm glad, I'm glad, Senpai...!!!!"
For as long as Sakura calls out to me, I'll love her.
Until I break apart.

I push up.
I ram myself into her to respond to her call.

"Haa, ahh, kuh, ah! Haa, it's good, please thrust it in, Senpai...!"

Our minds melt together.
Her breasts shake with our movements.
It must be because Sakura is up on her knees.
Sakura is bracing herself with her legs.
So she's putting strength into her sphincter, causing her walls to squeeze me harder than before.

"Ah, it's gonna rip...! Senpai, ahh, ah, hm, ahh!"
...Sakura isn't moving anymore.
I'm the one doing the thrusting.
I thrust so hard that I might break her.

My urge to ejaculate is already over the limit.
I can't hold it back with my will anymore.
It should already be over.
But my ejaculation is held back.
I'm not bearing it, but something's holding it back as I keep thrusting into Sakura.

"No, ha, no, ahh, noI'm gonna go crazy... Senpai... More, Senpai...! Ahhh, ahh, fua, haa!!!!"

The pleasure just keeps accumulating.
The light of pleasure almost fries my brain.
But I still lust for Sakura.

"Nha, haa...! More, Senpai...! Please break me more, ah, I love you, ah, you're breaking me, ah, this is like a dream, I always wanted you to embrace me, SenpaiSenpai, Senpai, Senpai......!!!"

"Haa, ah, ah!"
Which one of us is broken?
It feels like she's sucking up my energy.

It's similar to something...

It doesn't matter.
I don't care.
Sakura is the only thing I care about right now.

"Come, haa, nhaa...! Yes, ah... deeper...! Don't let me go, no, Senpai, I don't want to let go...!"

My sensations run wild.
My sanity escapes into oblivion.
Yes, I'm crazy.
Then why not forget about things I don't want to think about: my tired body, Sakura's perverted actions, my left arm that I want to cut off

"HaSakuraSakura, Sakura, Sakura...!"
Cracks run across my vision.
The thing that held me back starts to disappear.

"Ahh...! Ah, haa, haI'm coming, no, I'm gonna come before you...! TogetherSenpai, Senpai, come together with me!"
"Yeahme too...!"

The urge to ejaculate.
It's about to unload everything from the very root.
"Hm, ahah, Senpai!"
I slam my cum into her pussy along with my penis.

"Ahhm, ah......"

Her walls convulse.
In a trance, Sakura strokes her stomach, filled with my cum.

"......Hm...... I have to take all of it"
How conscious is she?
My cum flows out of her slit, dripping down indecently.
"...Oh... No, it's flowing out..."
Sakura squeezes, as if unwilling to let it go.

"!"
My penis convulses and lets out what is left inside.
...And I'm done.
My penis loses its power, turns flaccid, and stops pushing apart Sakura's vagina.

"Ah......... Haa........."
I somehow manage to keep my sanity while the pleasure assails me.
...I push her waist and let myself out.
"Ohit's out..."
A shudder runs through her.

Sakura takes a deep breath, and...
"Fuaa... I reached orgasm, Senpai"
She falls onto my body.

My reasoning disappears.
My energy is gone, and I released all of my magical energy.

"Ah!"
...The power in my mind turns off.
I can't think of anything.
I can't recall what happened tonight, the pleasure that was only pain.

"This is just like"
It's like it was a dream.
...I fall into a deep sleep.
My tired body forgets about the fact that Sakura came to this room, the uneasiness in my mind, what happened tonight, and...
...I go back to the light sleep I was having an hour ago.
It is in a red sea.

The familiar scenery is submerged in seawater, turning the town into an aquarium.
Instead of air, something thick flows into the throat.
The more it gasps for breath, the more of the heavy, watery substance it sucks in.
So this has to be underwater.

It gasps out that it is painful.
It originally lived on land. It cannot possibly live underwater.
It tries to reach the surface, and it eventually reaches the highest place in the town.
The suffocation does not abate.
It looks down at the town, lungs burning from lack of oxygen, and curses the peacefully sleeping townspeople.

It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.
There's no air here.
There's no pain here.
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.
It drags corpses behind it.
Its body is bright red with blood.
It hurts. It hurts. Need more. It hurts.

In its black hands are many corpses.
The distorted hands grasp many dead bodies.

      Need more. Need more. Need more. Need more.

It smashes them, dyeing itself red.
Need more air.
The air hurts.
The water pressure is uncaring.
The water pressure is unbearable.
It smears the red blood all over its body.
It probably thinks that the blood is the only watertight protection it has to live in this water.

It reaches out its twisted hands.
Illuminated by the moon, the dark hand becomes a giant shadow and descends to crush the town

"Ah......!"
She wakes up.
She's breathing hard from her restless sleep.
Astonished by the dream's realism, she hugs her feverish body.
At that instant...
Her hands are wet with blood.

"Ah, ah!"
She shuts her eyes and pulls her hands away.
...But when she looks again, they are clean.
Although she knows it was just a hallucination, she can't stop trembling.

She trembles.
She trembles like a broken machine.
She trembles so violently that bolts might spill from her ears.
All the parts in her body will spill out like thatand the image is so frightening that she cannot stop trembling.

"My face. Yeah, I have to go wash my face"
She heads to the bathroom.
She makes it only a few steps.
Her quaking limbs will not follow her orders.
She braces herself against a desk.

"...Ah... Ah"
Her vision wavers.
She can't make it to the door.  She can't even see it clearly.
She can't remember what kind of a dream she was having, or why she got out of bed.

"...Ugh... Ah."
She's broken.
She can't remember anything.
She can't think of anything.
There is nothing but lust and hunger.
She wants hot skin, breath, sensation, penis, semen, and kind words.
Her empty but mushed-up insides plead for more sex.

"Ahuh."
She lies on the desk and shakes her head.
Fear and infinite self-hatred.
Something is wrong.
Why hasn't she had enough?
A few hours ago, she was loved, just like in her fantasies, but it hasn't filled her up at all.
It felt great, and she thought there could be no greater happiness, but she's not the least bit satisfied.

She's probably empty, and that's why he alone cannot fill her up.
But she doesn't want anyone else.
She wants to be his for much longer.
She wanted it at the cost of time, emotion, and other people, so why didn't she do so? And she naturally realizes that she can eliminate all the things she just thought about.

"Oh"
She feels dizzy.
It's not so far-fetched.
What's scary is that...
She really thought that it would be fun.

"Ahuh... ugh...!"
She leans on the desk.
She keeps her collapsing body steady.
The frightening dream becomes clearer every day.
The frightening dream becomes less frightening every day.
She is breaking down.
Until now, it was only her body.
But now, she is beginning to go mad.

"...Uh... uh, ugh."
Moans escape her mouth.
Her vague memory is no problem.
It doesn't matter if she cannot remember what happened a few hours ago.
She's not scared of being in bed forever.

She is terrified of becoming something else.
She doesn't want to become a bad person.
If she slowly breaks down like this, she will go crazy in the end.
She will probably become something that will cause him the most trouble.


That's what terrifies her.
It's scary to go crazy. It's more scary than anything else.
If she does, he will not touch her, nor will he love her.
She won't be able to be with him.  She won't even know if she is with him.
Not only that. If she loses her mind, he will be with another woman.

She doesn't want that. She really doesn't want that.
She always thought he should be with someone else, someone better suited to him, but she can no longer accept that.

    Because...
    He is already hers.

...That's why it's frightening.
She's scared of what she might do.

"...Ughuh, kuh"
She knows, yet there's no salvation.
She cannot tell him of this disfunction.
If she tells him, it will be back to the cold for her.
She cannot return to the cold now that she has known warmth.
She wants to...
Keep smiling at him.

But she knows what will be lost if this continues.
Her wish is just a desire.
She wishes for one person's happiness, yet her happiness requires the ruin of that same person.

If she cannot do so, she should just break down and disappear.
If she's going to go crazy, she should disappear now and become a monster in a place with no people.
That should be the best choice.

But she still clings to it.
She wishes for more because it's warm and happy here.
So why?
Why is such a normal desire forbidden to her?

"NoNo, no, no, no...!"
She shakes off her weakness.
She's not envious.
She's not holding any grudges.
She justifies her decision, saying that she merely wants to stay here.

"Nothis isn't me."
She shakes her head in denial.
She shuts her dark mind with an empty head.
There are no happy endings.
She turns her eyes away from the obvious conclusion.

"Ughuhh, ugh"
...Her hazy mind is already experiencing another nightmare.
Forcing down her wish to be saved, she keeps on crying.

"So. First off, how's your arm doing, Shirou?"
Tohsaka cuts right to the chase when I get to the dojo.

"Well, I can move it fine. But that's not what you're asking me, right?"
"Right. I'm asking you if you understand Archer's arm."
Ilya is watching us silently.


...I swear Tohsaka doesn't know what this arm is.
She doesn't know about the fear I felt last night.
It'll be over for me if I take this cloth off.
She doesn't know my body will be destroyed if I let this arm free, let alone use it.

I recall the sensation.
Unavoidable death.
It felt like being buried alive.
Utter obliteration, where the world is covered beneath something mysterious and ends in silence.

After just a glimpse of it, my mind repeated to itself in terror...
That I cannot use this arm.
I'll die if I use it.
Without some sort of miracle, I will definitely die.

"How is it? It's been a day since I transplanted my crest, so it should be working now.
 Answer me. Do you know what you can do with Archer's arm?"

"?"
...Hold on.
Tohsaka's question is not exactly what I'd been expecting.
I thought she wanted to know if I could use the arm.

"Um... so you're not asking me if I can suppress his arm, but if I know what his Noble Phantasm is?"

"O-Of course! It'll be terrible if you use Archer's arm, so there's no way I'm going to let you! Or what!? Were you thinking about using it!?"
Oh.
Tohsaka's seriously angry.

"Uh... No, but I thought that's where the conversation was going..."
"What are you talking about!?"

"...Geez. Let me tell you. I forbid you to use Archer's arm, no matter the situation.
 And don't even consider using it without my permission.
 ...Um, you're taking Archer's place, so it'll trouble me if you die."


Tohsaka's serious.
...I take back what I said earlier.
She knows.
She's a much better magus than I am.
She knows more than me about what'll happen if I free this arm.

"So, how is it? Do you understand what Archer's Noble Phantasm is?"
She repeats the question.
I don't know what kind of an answer Tohsaka is expecting, but...
"Geez. Why don't you just tell her, Shirou? That you knew what it is since his arm has been transplanted."

"Wait, is that true, Shirou?"
"Ughwell, I think so. Archer's Noble Phantasm is his projection magic, and it's reproducing weapons, right?"

I have a vague idea, but I can't be sure, so I'm still half in doubt.

"...I guess I didn't need to be so nervous. So, you're already connected to it.
 That's helpful in its own way, but why didn't you say anything, Ilya? If Shirou knew about Archer's projection magic, I didn't even need to ask him."

"You didn't ask. You're the one who wants Shirou to do projection, so it's your role to ask. It's nothing I should butt in on."

"What's that? Are you going to say we're stopping after all that preparation?"

"That's for you two to decide.
 You'll certainly win if you can reproduce the gem sword. That's why I gave you a hand. But I only helped you because it's my obligation. It's not because I agree with your plan."

"......?"
Um...
Judging by their conversation, Tohsaka wants me to project something

"Can I say something? So in short, you have something you want reproduced?"

"Yup. I need you to reproduce something for me.
 We can't match Saber or that shadow. So we have to create something in place of Servants, a Conceptual Weapon that exceeds the Servants."

"Conceptual Weapon? Is that the fixed magical item that executes a set phenomenon?"
"Yes. It's an Outbreaker that defeats its opponent using the weight of its concept rather than physical damage. I'm going to have you project a special Conceptual Weapon that has been passed down through the Tohsaka family."

"The goal is to make something that can match Saber's Noble Phantasm.
 You saw Saber's Noble Phantasm that defeated Berserker, right?
 In terms of raw power, Saber's weapon is the strongest.
 I'm sure even the shadow would be destroyed by a blow from her Noble Phantasm, and we can't dodge or block it if it's used against us.
 Conversely, we can manage a fight if we can make a sword that exceeds Saber's Noble Phantasm, even if it's an imitation that breaks easily."


...It's a sound argument, and a natural conclusion.
If Saber's Noble Phantasm is their strongest weapon, we just need to prepare something that outperforms it.
Make a weapon that is stronger than your enemy's.
It's the simplest and surest way to win.
But.

"...I don't know. I can't project such a strong Noble Phantasm. No, first of all, I've never succeeded at projection magic"

"Yes. I'm sure you've never been able to do the kind of projection that we magi are familiar with.
 But your projection isn't on that level. You were merely doing it wrong because you didn't know how.
 But you now have Archer's knowledge, so you just need to trace it. With Archer as your example, you will succeed."


Tohsaka sounds confident.
But even so, I have no confidence in myself.

"Look. I've told you before, but you're a magus that uses projection, not strengthening.
 You might not be able to make a replica with the same power as the original, but you should get close to it if you follow Archer's theory."

"Our role is to back you up.
 We'll prepare the materials to be as close to the original as possible.
 Ilya is analyzing the blueprint that you'll be using during projection, and I'm preparing the materials that were used to make the real weapon."

"...It'll be a little longer, but it's up to you after that. If you can reproduce my master's pass, even if it's just the shape, we have a chance of victory against Zouken."

"......"
Um.
So they're going to prepare the blueprint and the materials, and I'm supposed to put it together?
I have no problem if we can defeat Zouken that way.
I'll happily go with her plan, but

"Let's assume I really can project this weapon.
 If that's the case, we won't need any materials. If you show me the original, I can copy it.
 We can try it right now instead of waiting for you to get ready."

"Are you stupid? If it were that simple, I would've had you try it two days ago.
 Look, you'll be able to project once at most, and the projected weapon is certain to have flaws.
 But that's meaningless. We can't have you make an imitation like the failures in the shed that look the same on the outside, but contain nothing on the inside."
"...Hm. But I can only make such imitations."

"That's why we're backing you up.
 We're preparing materials that are as close to the real thing as possible to compensate for the required knowledge and magical energy, and have you fix it in place with your image.
 It's simple addition. We add your image and the materials we prepared to achieve a better result."

"...Well, I'm sure we don't need the material or the blueprint if you use Archer's arm to project it, but that's not possible.
 This is the only way to prepare a weapon without relying on that arm."

"So we're strengthening what's there using projection, huh?
 ...Yeah, that does sound..."
It sounds plausible, and we might be able to do it with practice.

"But I don't know if it'll succeed or not.
 I wasn't able to consistently use strengthening magic until I became a Master. I don't think I can do something like that on the spot."
"Oh, that's all right.
 I'm going to have you train your projection and practice retrieving Archer's knowledge."

"...I see. That's good for me too, but you look happy, Tohsaka."
"No way. I've been playing with building blocks with Ilya for a while, so I'm just thinking how refreshing it is to talk with a bad student."

"......"
...Ugh. I get the chills, recalling the weird sensation from yesterday.
Tohsaka got me naked, came close to me, and stuck her fingers in me.

Nothing happened then, but if we're going to do that again today...

"Ugh."
I might get a big scolding from Sakura, resting in her room.

"So, do you get it now, with all jokes aside?
 I want to confirm everything one last time."
"Confirm?"

"I'm asking if you're okay with this plan.
 We'll be relying on your projection.
 I won't let you use Archer's arm, but his influence will still poison you as you imitate his magic. Knowing that, are you still okay with this plan?"

"Hey, I have no complaints if we can defeat Zouken. And it's promising if you're the one training me in magic."

"...I'll be honest here. Using Archer's magic means releasing the seal on his arm.
 In short, I'm telling you to take off that Shroud while we're training projection."


My mind freezes.
Take the Shroud off?
Release this arm that terrified me, made me cry, and made me shake in the corner, just by loosening the cloth?

I don't even need to think about it.
I...
"Okay. If that's what it takes."

I muster all my resolve.

"I'll go with your plan. I need to take this cloth off, right?"

And I manage to nod.

"......I see. So it's as I expected."
"What is it, Tohsaka? Is my answer not good enough?"

"No. I just reaffirmed that threatening you is meaningless.
 I didn't think you'd be okay with taking the Shroud off, but your answer is satisfactory."
Tohsaka looks away, clearly displeased.

"Hey, you're acting strange, Tohsaka. It took a lot of effort to agree to that, and now it feels like I'm at fault here."

"Yes, I am the strange one.
 Your response was exactly what I wanted, but actually hearing it made me mad."

"But Shirou. I've already said this, but I won't let you use Archer's arm. That means never taking the Shroud off.
 I'm not one to talk after testing your determination like that, but don't ever say you'll take the Shroud off.
 ...If you do, there'll be no turning back."
I can't do that.
I recall the pain from last night.
The indescribable agony and the certainty of impending doom frighten me to the core.
But more than that...
I'm scared of what I'll do when I free this arm.

"...No. I can't take this off. Once I do, it can't be undone."
Forcing down the fear, I make my decision.
Then.

"Good. It's troubling if you take that cloth off so easily."
Tohsaka is pleased, even though I refused.

"......? Tohsaka, I said I can't do it."
"I know. I'm sorry, but that was just a test.
 I thought I'd warn you ahead of time since you have a dangerous side to you. I would've tied you down if you agreed."

"...Test? ...You tested me, Tohsaka?"
"Oh... Yeah, I wanted to know what you thought.
 Look, I've already said this, but I won't let you use Archer's arm. That means never taking the Shroud off."

"I'm not one to talk after testing your determination like that, but don't ever say you'll take the Shroud off. If you do, there'll be no turning back."
It sounds more like a plea than a warning.


I grasp my left arm that's covered by the red cloth.
I don't want to take this off either.
But

"...Then what about imitating Archer's magic?
 I won't be able to draw out his magic unless I take this off, right?"

"Right. So I'm going to have you loosen the Shroud a bit. That won't break the seal, and the reaction from the arm should be small, right?"
"........Yeah. Then what you meant earlier by taking off the cloth is..."

"Yes. I just meant loosening the cloth slightly.
 But that's still a big deal, so I tested your determination."

"You would have to do this eventually, anyway.
 You don't want to keep that on forever, right? You won't be able to manage it in the future unless you can at least put it back on. Like taking a bath or if it comes undone somehow."
"Ohyou're right."

"Right? So you should at least get used to what happens when you loosen it.
 The crest from yesterday seems to have familiarized itself with your body, and your magical resistance has increased. Ilya will protect your consciousness, so I think you'll be able to keep it unbound for about five minutes."

"Ilya...? So you want us to suppress Archer's arm together?"
I look at Ilya, who has been quiet all this time.

"No. I'm only going to protect your mind, so it's your role to endure the flowback from Archer.
 You have to retrieve his experience, so you need to bear with it, not block it off."

...Oh.
If Ilya cuts off the flow of magical energy from Archer, I won't be able to learn his techniques.
Even if it's poison for me, I have to taste it to understand its content.

"...All right. So I'm to loosen the cloth and bear the flowback from the arm, right?"

"Yes. Make sure to close your eyes and concentrate within yourself.
 It's just like opening the Magic Circuit, so it should be easy, right?
 Your body just needs to experience Archer's projection technique.  Don't worry about trying to understand it."

"I'm sorry, but I'm gonna leave for a bit.
 I'll leave the rest to you, Ilya. Please train Shirou while I'm gone."
Tohsaka suddenly gets up and leaves without hurry.

"......? What's up with her?"
"I don't know. I think she forgot something.
 But you have things to do yourself, Shirou.
 I'm against something stupid like loosening the Shroud, but I'll help since you promised her. Let's finish this before she gets back."

Ilya comes behind me and lays her cold hand on my back.

"Ilya...?"
"Just close your eyes and meditate.
 I'll protect your mind and loosen the Shroud once the Magic Circuit opens up.
 I'll time it, so you just have to bear the flowback of magical energy. Be sure to make desperate efforts, or the reaction will definitely swallow you."

Ilya talks without emotion.
I nod back and close my eyes.

...I quietly gather my senses and create another nerve inside me.
This step has gotten much easier over the past few days.
Once I complete the line of light running through my back...

"I'm going to give you a needless warning.
 Rin only knows the pain of having a heroic spirit's arm transplanted onto you. She doesn't know what this is going to cause. She has no idea what this is going to do to you.
 But it can't be helped.
 I'm the only one in the world who knows about the relationship between you and Archer."

Ilya is saying something strange in a voice too vague to hear clearly.
It's morning.
My mind slowly

                                                                                                                                                         .

"Hm......"
It's morning.
As my mind slowly awakens, I sit up.

It's past eight o'clock.
I'm late for school.
Well, that's not really true since I'm not going to school, but it makes no difference to the fact that I slept in.

"Whoa. I have to make breakfast."
I get up and get changed.
I can't avoid looking at the cloth wrapped around my left arm.

".........All right."
I swing my arm as a warm-up exercise.
It's fine.
It rises up to my shoulders, as I intended.
It's getting better day by day.
There's still no sensation, but at this rate...

"What're you doing, Shirou? Breakfast is already over."
"Huh? What? What?"

Ilya is in front of me.
I should be in the living room, but I'm in the shed for some reason.

"Are you listening to me, Shirou? I'm asking what you're doing here."
"YYeah, I'm listening. Good morning, Ilya. What a strange place to meet up."

......Hm.
That was an odd reply on my part.
It seems I'm not awake yet.

"Shirou? You're not feeling well?"
"Huh? Oh, no. It's just that I'm only half awake, so give me a minute."
I shake my head.
My body is dead tired, but my sleepiness goes away.

"All right. So, answering your question, I don't have any business here. I just made a stupid mistake because I was half-asleep."
"I see. Then let's go to the living room! I'll prepare your breakfast."
Ilya happily runs across the yard.

The sky is nice.
It's bright blue, as if trying to wash away yesterday's gloomy air.
I take a deep breath, and the cold, refreshing air fills my lungs.

"Hm? Did Ilya just say she'll make breakfast?"
That's the first thing I say after I'm fully awake.

Ilya's breakfast... I'm looking forward to it, but I'm also worried at the same time.
I'm pretty sure that Ilya has never even held a knife before, let alone cooked.

"Oh... I should go keep an eye on her."
I run across the prickling grass to the living room.
And I'm astonished once again.
I must've been really out of it.
What was I thinking, coming here in my bare feet?

Four minutes after Ilya...
I get up on the porch after wiping my feet.
"Oh, Senpai."
I run into Sakura as she comes out of the living room.

"Good morning, Sakura. ...I'm sorry about this morning. I overslept, and it was past eight when I noticed."

...?
Maybe she didn't hear me. She's just looking blankly at my face.

"Sakura?"
I reach out, afraid that she's sick again.
Then.
"G-Good morning, Senpai!"
Or maybe she isn't, because she greets me with lots of energy.

"Oh, you're full of energy. So I'm guessing you feel well?"
"Y-Yes, I'm doing great, thanks to you. You gave me energy!"

"...?"
Sakura sounds awkward.
...Being energetic is a good thing, but I get uneasy seeing her so restless.

"What's wrong, Sakura? You're acting weird. First of all, what do you mean by me giving you energy?"
"Umwell, um, last night..."
"In your room..."
Sakura trails off, blushing furiously.

"Oh."
I remember now.
No, there's no way I can forget about it.
Last night...
I had sex with Sakura.

And it was our second time.
We did it more furiously than the first time, and I lusted for Sakura's body.

"Uhum."
Blood rushes to my head in an instant.
I almost think that there's no blood left below my neck.

"S-Sakura... The thing last night..."
That wasn't a dream, right?
Sakura is still blushing, but she shakes her head and looks at me critically.

"...!!!!"
Amazing.
I thought my face couldn't get any hotter, but I guess I was wrong.
...Um, last night was amazing.

Sakura's service, our animalistic sex...
It was so stimulating that my mind labeled the event a dream and filed it away in the corner of my memoryno!

"Sakura. Um... I'm sorry I was rough yesterday."
Ignoring the blazing heat I feel, I apologize.
"Okay. But I was happy, Senpai."
Sakura smiles and gives a lethal reply.

"Uhum."
She got me.
Sakura's so cute that I want to push her down right here.

I would've lost it for real if the sound of the TV hadn't come from the living room, and...
"Shirou? Breakfast's ready."
...And if Ilya hadn't called for me at exactly the right time.

"S-So I'm going to go eat breakfast! I-I'll talk to you later about this!"
I pivot like a robot and head to the living room.
My limbs move awkwardly as I force down my desires.
"Here's your breakfast, Shirou!"
Ilya hands me a plate as soon as I enter the living room.
On the plate are blackened toast, a runny sunny-side up egg, and cut tomatoes.

"Oh, thanks."
My head's still dizzy, but I sit down at my usual spot and start biting on the toast.
I decline to comment on the toast, but the egg is done pretty well. Maybe she copied someone, or perhaps Tohsaka taught her.
Anyway, I have to give her a perfect score if this is her first time cooking.

"It's good."
I crunch on the toast.
 Ilya doesn't seem happy or proud, but simply watches me in satisfaction.

I'm not giving in to her happy mood, but I decide not to ask why the toast feels like coal.
It's good.
Having your toast black or hard is a matter of personal preference.

"It is a problem. You'll get sick if you eat something burned like that."
"You idiot. The burned spots are the best, whether it's rice or toast."
"...Hey. Are you all right, Emiya-kun?"
"I'm saying it's good. And I guess doing it rough is all right."
"You must really be half-asleep. This isn't time to be saying such carefree things, you know?"

Tohsaka looks at the TV.
The TV is on, showing the morning news.

Is this deja vu?
The news seems to be a story I've already seenand my mind sharpens up.

The captions on the screen.
An incidence of unexplained comas occurred in Shinto last night.
The residents lost consciousness overnight.
It's being treated just like the other mysterious comas, but it's different from before.
The area of the incident is 50 meters in diameter.
It used to only happen in one building at a time, but the damage is spread much further now.

...And that's not the only problem.
At the end of the report...
Beside the triple-digit number of victims is a new list called "missing people".

"Tohsaka, this is..."
"Yes. Fourteen missing people. I'm sure there'll be more once they look into it. Well, it looks like about a tenth of the people were completely swallowed."


My mind freezes.
I unconsciously...

"Do you get it now? I don't know if this is Zouken or the shadow's doing, but it makes no difference to the fact that there are more victims now.
 At this rate, a whole section of the town will be swallowed in a few days."

Squeeze my left arm.

"Tohsaka. Are the missing people dead?"
I ask to confirm.
Tohsaka looks away, which is answer enough.

"...That's all. I understand how you feel, but feeling guilty can come later.
 Look, they're starting to do as they please because they think we can't do anything about it. They can do ridiculous things because they're taking us lightly.
 So I don't even need to say what we need to do, right?"

Tohsaka quietly gets up.
...There's only one place she could be going.
Tohsaka does not urge me to join her, but goes ahead to the dojo.
"Well."
She leaves the two of them and comes out into the yard.
"What's going on, Sakura? Weren't you resting in your room since you're sick?"
Tohsaka Rin coldly regards the girl before her.

"........."
Matou Sakura looks down uneasily.


There are no words between them.
Rin mercilessly condemns the outsider, Sakura, who is at a loss for words, feeling beholden and inferior.

"Sakura. If you're here because you're worried about Emiya-kun, go back. I'll pretend I didn't see you."
"......!"
Sakura trembles a bit.
Her older sister is bitter.
She corners Sakura, even when she knows of her uneasiness.

"No, Nee-san. I just..."
Pushing her resolve, Sakura looks at her ideal, her older sister.
But...
"You don't need to explain. I'm telling you to go back to your room.
 I'm not going to let you in the dojo, no matter what you tell me."
Rin cuts off the girl's utmost resistance.

"Why can't I go in?"
"Do I really need to spell it out? You're our enemy when we're acting as Masters.
 Look, Sakura. Even if you and Rider are just staying in the house without fighting, it doesn't change the fact that you're under Zouken's control. There's no way we can train in front of such a person."


Faced with the cold words, Sakura can only stand there.
Tohsaka Rin is serious.
Unlike Shirou, her sister is worrying about when she might fall under Zouken's sway and become their enemy.
...No.
Rin probably assumes they will end up as enemies.

"......"
She bites her lip.
But she can't talk back.
As Rin says, Sakura can fall into Zouken's hands at any time.
Her body is getting worse every day, and her memory is becoming more vague.
Her only respite came when she slept, but now she's begun having nightmares.
...It'll be no surprise if she goes crazy at any time.

"That's right. Walking around when you have no magical energy only bothers us.
 You don't know when you might collapse. Well, I'm sure you won't collapse right now since you've settled down, but Emiya-kun will worry if you push yourself.
 ...He'd be even more cornered if that happens. That's not what you want, right?"

"......"
Rin is absolutely right.
Sakura drops her gaze further, biting her lip helplessly.

"Do you understand? Then get going. I'll go get you at noon, so rest until then."
She nods.
Rin turns her back to her younger sister.
As if to tell her...
...That she's just a nuisance.

"H-Hold on, Nee-san...!"
"What? You still have something to say?"
"Yes. I understand your point. I'll go back to my room.
 ...But please tell me. What are you going to have Senpai do?
 You know he can't fight anymore, right?
 But you're seeing him, and what more are you going to make him do...!?"


She stops before leaving.
Matou Sakura's appeal is born of desperation.
A fury of emotion that the quiet girl has never shown.
Though surprised, Rin answers her with the same coldness as before.

"I'm teaching him magic. We can't beat Saber, Zouken, or the black shadow as we are right now.
 So I'm going to have Shirou draw magic from Archer's arm.  That arm is filled with his experience, and that experience will flow continuously into Shirou if we loosen the Shroud, forcing Shirou to level up."

"Wha"
As a magus of the Matou, Sakura knows that this is a reckless plan.
What her sister intends to do is just torture.
It's like pouring a hundred units of fuel into a container called Emiya Shirou that can only hold ten.
Even if ten thousand units are poured, the excess will overflow, and the container will only hold ten.

But that will only be painful.
Emiya Shirou will gain from less than a tenth of the agony he goes through.
And most of alla person with a normal mind will never be able to endure it.
If you set a mud puppet against a tidal wave, the puppet will be washed away.
That's what loosening the Shroud means

"That's absurd! Senpai's body won't last if you do such a thing...!
 No, not only that! Senpai trusts you, Nee-san. That's why he's accepting your reckless plan.
 I'm sure he'll take that cloth off in the end if you tell him...!"

"Sakura."
Sakura does not look down.
She stares straight at her sister.

To that...
"...You're right. But, Sakura. He would take the Shroud off himself even if I don't tell him to. I realized it when I was talking to him earlier.
 ......Honestly. In the end, he'll take it off like it's nothing, no matter how strongly I warn him."
Tohsaka replies in a powerless voice.

"Eh... Nee-san?"
"Yes. I know that, so I had to suggest a plan that wouldn't make him take it off.
 If he knows we can manage without having him take the Shroud off, he won't do it unless it's a last resort. So my role is to make him create a weapon within set limitations.
 I'll have him rest after that. I'll even confine him, keeping him out of combat until the Holy Grail War is over."


She's telling the truth.
Tohsaka Rin is showing as much consideration as she can.
...But that is her mind as Tohsaka Rin.
As the successor of an old family lineage, Sakura knows the other side of Rin.

"Nee-san. I understand that you're concerned for Senpai's safety.
 But that's it. If you find out that you cannot beat Grandfather with the current method, you will end up using him.
 You're a magus of Tohsaka. You will use Senpai as a tool to win... to protect the law of magi."

They are not questions, but statements of fact.
The Tohsaka heir closes her eyes and...
"Yes. If our current method fails, and if Zouken and the shadow continue their rampageI'll have Shirou use Archer's arm. It's only natural if his life is the only thing at stake."
...She makes a declaration with her head held high.

"...That's selfish of you. Senpai never wanted the Holy Grail. He became a Master by chance. So it's wrong to force him to keep fighting."
"Hmph. It seems you misunderstand, Sakura."

"Look. I'm not forcing him, and even if that's true, Shirou has no right to object. His life was saved because I gave him my Archer's arm. But he hasn't tried to cut it off yet.
 That means his life is mine now.
 He's my Archer as long as he doesn't get rid of his arm."

"Do you get it? Shirou is my familiar until this war ends.
 There's no reason for you to butt in. As long as he wants to fight, I'm going to lend him my powers, and I'm going to borrow his power."
"......!"
She cannot say anything.
The girl cannot say anything back to her sister, who is full of intimidating confidence.

"Is that all? Then go back to your room. Didn't I tell you you're just being a distraction?"
Tohsaka Rin turns around and heads to the dojo.
The girl watches it as if it's a distant scene.

...The familiar yard is vast.
There is nothing around, and it feels like nothing is within reach.
In that artificial solitude...
"I see. So you're taking Senpai as well, Nee-san?"
...The girl murmurs something without emotion.
Whoa.
I don't know when Tohsaka got back, but she's in front of me.

"Huh? What are you doing, Tohsaka?"
"                         "
"                         "
  "                 state            right?"
"              rather             lunch         Rin and Sakura        Sakura more             "

"......."
...That's strange.
Why are they talking secretly in front of me?

"Tohsaka, Ilya."
......?
Maybe my throat is bad, as I can't talk in a big voice.
"Hmm... All right...

 Hey, what are you two talking about!?"

Their conference abruptly ends.
"Ah, ah, ah."
Oh, it's back now.
It seems the loud voice did the trick.

"What? You said my seasoning is new to you. So you don't like spicy food, Shirou?"

"Your food makes my tongue numb instead of just being spicy.
 We already decided to have Sakura cook lunch, so let it go already. Shirou said he wants Sakura's stew too."

It seems they're talking about lunch.
"Hey, now's not the time to"
I stop halfway into my sentence.
I see the clock and find out it's almost noon.


...Something's nagging at the back of my mind.
Nothing's strange. The dojo's the same as always, but I'm getting chills.
It...

Tohsaka left at nine o'clock.

      Information I don't know in my head.
Groceries

        I responded to their conversation
   something

in my head are details of every      weapon

   Ilya said something concerning

     the pain of the white arm

skipping 40, and 26 times

    the memory disappeared and returned.


I hit my forehead with my fingers.
It's fine.
The dizziness is gone now.

"Shirou? What's wrong? You're going to the shopping district with Ilya, right?"
I look through my memory.
I did indeed say we'll go shopping together.

"Yeah. Let's go, Ilya."
I shake my head and start walking.
"...Hey. You're acting strange. You were fine when we put the Shroud back on. Did the fatigue just catch up to you?"

"Hm? Oh...... Yeah, I'm a bit confused, but it's all right."

This is nothing compared to the pain from yesterday, and my body feels fine.
I was just a bit dizzy, so there's no problem at all.
"Oh."
A crashing sound comes from the kitchen.
This is the fourth time this afternoon.

"I-I'm sorry, I'm okay...!"
Sakura's voice comes from the kitchen.
...Tohsaka must be tired of scolding her, because she just sits there quietly.

It's before six.
Sakura is making dinner, as she requested.
Tohsaka and I were kicked out of the kitchen, so we're waiting for dinner without doing anything.

"Oh...!"
...The sound of a dropped plate.
In just half a day, I've grown used to hearing the sound of Sakura's mistakes.

...It all started earlier today.
Sakura couldn't make her stew after we returned from shopping.
When we came home, she was clearly not feeling well.

"I'm fine. I might have a fever, but I can still make lunch."

I'm sure Sakura could've made lunch.
But I can't push her when she has a fever.
At around two o'clock, Tohsaka and I managed to persuade her to take a nap.

And at the time, we promised her...
"Then I can cook if my fever goes down?"
...That.

And later in the afternoon...
Sakura was starting to cook in the kitchen after more training that ended before I knew it.

"Oh, welcome back, Senpai. Please hold on, dinner will be ready soon."
Sakura goes back to work, full of spirit.
But I can instantly tell she's just bluffing.

'You must be tired, so go ahead and rest.'
Sakura doesn't back down, even when I tell her Tohsaka and I will do the cooking instead.

"Geez. Please don't be so overprotective. I'm a Master too. This is nothing compared to fighting."

Maybe she's being obstinate, as Sakura does not back down.
On top of that, she wouldn't even accept any help from Tohsaka or me.

Tohsaka's surprise is so unexpected that I'm stunned.

"B-But Nee-san is training Senpai, so I can't be the only one doing nothing.
 I want to be of use, like Nee-san.
 ...And this is a role I've had for a long time. I want to keep doing it."

...This must be one thing Sakura can't give up.
It'll only make you uneasy if you can't do something that's been part of your routine for a long time.

'All right. I'll leave you in charge of dinner.'

Tohsaka started to criticize me.
But...
"Okay! I'll do my best, Senpai!"
It was nothing compared to Sakura's joy.

"All right, thanks for waiting!"
A cheerful voice echoes through the room.
Sakura starts putting the dishes onto the table.

"Oh, seasoned rice. That's a complicated meal you made, Sakura."
"Yes. You bought some good clams and shrimps, so I went with seafood tonight.
 The rice is cooked along with clams, the shrimps are steamed with minced meat, the squids are ethnic-styled, and I made some hamburger steak for Ilya-chan."

She's filled with confidence.
Everything looks delicious, like she put all her heart into it.
I'm pretty sure the secret ingredient is her high spirits.

"Wow."
*Clap* *Clap* *Clap*
The three of us at the table clap.

"I didn't know how it'd turn out, but it seems this'll be worth the wait. Thanks for the meal."
"I'm not going to hold back either. Can you pass me a fork, Shirou?"
"Here you go. Then I'm going to have some as well."
"Okay. There's more, so please eat up."

I bow and reach out for the steamed shrimp wrap.
It's bite-sized, looking more like steamed dumplings.
It looks pretty, with the topping of green onion, ginger, and radish sprout.
I was worried about letting Sakura cook for all four of us, but this is more than


...I freeze.
All three of us make a sour face for an instant.

We continue eating as if nothing happened.
...No, we can only continue eating.
None of the food on the table is good.
It's not that they're terrible.
But everything seems to lack something, and the taste is out of balance.


An awkward silence.
We don't make eye contact, but wordlessly continue eating.

...But it should be impossible to keep deceiving Sakura.
She's the one who made it.
She'll notice right away once she starts eating.
Our silence is only delaying the problem.


I look at Sakura.
...She must have realized it by now.
Sakura should be shocked, but...
She hasn't even taken a bite yet.

"...?"
I keep looking at her.
...What's going on?
Sakura is looking down at her bowl and chopsticks with a troubled face.

...After a moment's hesitation, she reaches out.
The chopsticks fall.
She quickly grabs them, and reaches out for the bowl.


I can't keep watching this.
...Sakura keeps repeating the same action.
She reaches out for the food with clumsy hands.
But she drops her chopsticks every time, and picks them up in a hurry.
...It doesn't seem like her fingers are merely numb.
It looks so clumsy that it seems like she's forgetting how to use the chopsticks every time she picks them up.

"U-Um... oh..."
...She doesn't see it.
Sakura should know how obvious it is to us, but she doesn't notice.
As if telling us she's all right, she keeps going through the same motions.

...She awkwardly picks up the food, quickly brings it to her mouth, puts it in with some difficulty, and then tries to remember how to use the chopsticks again.
She's trying so hard that there's no way I can ask if she's all right.

Tohsaka doesn't notice.
Or rather, she keeps eating as if she doesn't notice.


I do the same.
We pretend not to notice Sakura's abnormality and finish dinner silently.

I decide to clean up afterward.
Sakura wanted to, but I stopped her.
It doesn't seem like she can handle it, and I don't want her to find out that she can't do something she's so accustomed to.

"Just go back to your room, warm yourself up, and go to sleep. A little rest took care of your fever from before, right? Then"
Your fingers will work again if you sleep and rest.

I unnaturally stop myself.

"........."
"........."
Sakura bites her lip and looks down.

"Sakura. It's not like you'll be like that forever. It'll just take longer to get better if you push yourself when you're sick.
 None of this is your fault, so you should rely on us a bit."

"TThat's not true...! I'm not sick at all!
 My fever's gone, I can remember what happened yesterday, and I know who you are...! There's nothing for you to be worried about. So please don't worry"

"...You'll be fine, even if we don't worry about you? Don't be stupid. I'll be direct if you're going to push yourself."

"You took two hours to make dinner. You dropped a plate seven times, and you seasoned the food all wrong.
 You screwed up the salt and used too much pepper.  It didn't even seem like your cooking. Enthusiasm is fine, but it's counterproductive if you can't get results."


"Do you get it? You think you're well, but you're still sick. That's the only thing that'd make you mess up.
 ...I'm angry, okay? Starting tomorrow, you're barred from the kitchen. I'm not going to let you push yourself until your fever breaks."

Without waiting for her reply, I pull her to the guest room.
Her steps are heavy, but I ignore them and take her to her room.
Tohsaka is waiting at the door.
It's ten o'clock.
I know it's useless, but it's time to go patrol the town.

"...That was fast. How's Sakura?"
"I made her go to sleep. I'm sure she was tired. She fell asleep soon after she laid down."

"I see. Then we'll leave the rest to Ilya and Rider. We can't see Rider, but I'm sure she's guarding Sakura from somewhere in this house."

"........."
Rider is protecting Sakura, just like she says.
I'm sure she's remaining in spirit form to ease the burden on Sakura.

  'She probably will not last a few more days.'

...I recall the priest's words.
The crest worm in her body will take her magical energy as long as the Holy Grail War continues.
It's dangerous to put form to her Servant in her condition, and she should save her energy for emergencies.
That's why Rider is in spirit form.

"You look gloomy. Do you want to say something?"
"Huh?"
Something I want to say...?
How stupid. Of course I want to say something.

"Tohsaka. Can we beat Zouken tonight?"
We have no time to waste.
Sakura is weakening day by day.
If I'm to believe the priest's words, she might die tomorrow

"That's impossible. We can't match him right now.
 ...I understand your rush, but you have to be patient if you want to save Sakura. We can't help her if we die."
"We won't fight yet. ...Okay, I understand that. Then..."

"You want to say there's no point in patrolling? Shirou. Is beating Zouken all we want to do? No, right? You don't want any innocent people getting involved and dying, right?"


...That's right.
I know. I know.
The patrol has a meaning. Even if we just run away if we find them, we have to do everything we can so that there won't be victims like yesterday.
...But...
What did I swear to protect more than that oath?

"...Shirou...? Are you all right, Emiya-kun...?"
"Oh, I just felt a bit dizzy. I'm sorry, Tohsaka. I wasn't thinking."

"You don't have to apologize. Sakura's in danger, but you must be tired as well.
 I was actually going to have you acquire projection in three days, but you worked hard and succeeded it today. I understand that you want to fight now."

"What?"
I'm able to use projection after just today's training...?

"What? Did I say something weird?"
"No. Um, the training was so hard that it took everything I had to get through it, so it doesn't seem real."

"Yeah, you were absorbed in it. But you were able to project a dagger on your last try, thanks to that.
 Well, your success rate is below ten percent, so you need to keep practicing."


...Well, I guess that's how it was if I was that into it.
That's probably why it was late afternoon when I noticed.

When we get to town, I realize something's wrong.

Tohsaka must notice as well, because she shuts her mouth and concentrates on the surroundings.
The scene's the same as always.
It's past ten o'clock, and the town is dark and quiet.
There's no one out on the streets, and there is no sound.
...It's become familiar since the Holy Grail War started. A quiet, nighttime atmosphere.
But...

"It's quiet."
Tohsaka murmurs beside me.
...Yes.
It's quiet here.
The town has been quiet at night these past few days.
It's the deepest silence, the deepest sleep.

But still...
The silence tonight is quieter even than that.

"...Hey. Was it like that over there yesterday? It's not unusual for the houses to be dark, but even the streetlamps are off."

Tohsaka is looking down the road that leads to the Ryudou Temple.
The opposite direction from Shinto, right into the suburbs.
There's no light there, and it looks like a black wall.

"Let's go."
I step into the dark town.
Tohsaka is silent.
...This is something we don't even need to think about.
We both know what happened.
It's contradictory.
We know we'll have to admit the truth if we go, but we start walking, hoping that we'll be proven wrong.

"!"
What did I feel when I first saw it?
A black wall, completely obscuring the other side...
The instant I pass it, I understand what happened in this area.

The town is too quiet.
It's not that the town is asleep.
This is nothingness, devoid of any human presence.
It's total stillness, brought on by the death of everything in the area.

I get dizzy.
There's no change in the town.
The areaabout fifty households are standing in the darkness with no change.

There's no sign of broken doors.
There's no sign of broken windows.
And of course, there are no cranes to remove the roof and take everything out of these houses.
And at the same time...
The presence of the hundreds of people who should live in this area is gone.

"Emiya-kun. Let's go in that house."
She puts on gloves and goes into a nearby house.
She goes by the gate.
She opens the front door.
She walks through the hallway.
She goes up the stairs, looks through the second floor, confirms that it's empty, and goes back outside.

"The people in the blacked-out houses are..."
Tohsaka says they're gone.
The town is like always.
The buildings haven't even been scratched, and there are no corpses.
It's so clean that nobody would notice the abnormality even in the morning.
But still...
This area looks more barren than that time.

We look through a few more houses, but it yields the same results.
The buildings have no damage, but the people in them are gone.
All that's there are traces of magical energy.
Every building, road, and ground.
The black afterimage is stuck everywhere.
I know that thing caused this disaster.


I feel dizzy.
I feel like vomiting.
Corpses without corpses.
Blood without blood.
The desolate town, engulfed by the shadow.
I'm walking in such a place...

So why does an unrelated image pop up in my head?

...But it's not unrelated.
It can't be unrelated if it comes to mind.
'Stop.'

Remember. Remember.
You know this. You know this presence, this smell.

It happened back then too.
What did you imagine when you saw it for the first time?
'Don't realize it.'

It's the same.
No, something heavier engulfed this area.

'No.'

That time too.
Why did you...

...Imagine such a thing?

'That's...'

I have no positive proof.
I have no reason.
I have no motive.
I have no evidence.

'Who is this similar to?'

That can't be.
It's impossible.
I can't admit it.
But the more I think...

'If I become a bad person...'

I have no proof, so I'm made to believe that my intuition is right.
Yes. Because the sensation is...

'Stop. Don't think about stupid things.'

...Too similar to the heavy nightmare that comes after making love to 

"Shirou? Why did you stop? Is something wrong?"

I shake my head to dispel the dizziness.
...It seems the traces of the shadow are getting to me.

"No, I just feel nauseous. Don't worry about me and go on."
"Really? ...That's bad. So its lingering presence affects you, even with your increased magical resistance.
 ...Well, I guess that's to be expected with the amount of magical energy. You can't engulf a town unless that's the case."

"Ohit's not like I'm out of energy. I just felt sick, so it didn't take anything from me."
Tohsaka understands.
More importantly, we have to find out what happened here.

"......So. What happened there?"
"Well... It's eating, just like all the other incidents. It's just that the scale is much greater.
 Guessing from the traces, it didn't go to each house individually. It probably engulfed the area like a tidal wave and melted into the ground. It must've been hungry. It wanted to finish the food in one mouthful."

"But it seems it doesn't like inorganic stuff. It went past anything that wasn't alive, only digesting what was.
 ...If there's any comfort, it's that they disappeared right away. There was no time to feel any fear or pain."

A boundary field of dissolution.
Tohsaka explains that it's like the boundary field Rider set up at school, but much stronger and instantaneous.

"The problem is that I couldn't detect the magic, even though it's so powerful.
 ...If that shadow did this, it means this is not its magic, but just an ordinary action. In short, the dissolution in this area is like tossing around in its sleep for that shadow."

...I see.
But it's over.
The shadow is satisfied with the food and disappeared. There's no way or reason for us to follow it.


There's no reason to keep patrolling.
The damage has already been done, and we can't do anything without a way to sense the shadow.
We thought we could save people if we rushed to the scene when the shadow or Zouken was attacking them.
But it's meaningless now.

Because we have no way to find that shadow, and most of all...
"I suspected it, but that thing is growing every day. It'll be an unstoppable monster the next time it appears."
...We have no chance of victory right now.
A complete silence.
But they are not the only ones enjoying the spectacle.
No, that expression is incorrect.
The girl and the boy.
They are both still willing to fight, so they are not enjoying the spectacle.
Only inhuman minds are able to enjoy this spectacle.

"My, it is troubling if it does not know moderation.
 I let it alone for my good, but I may have to eliminate it soon."

The old man laughs.
The man and the white skull roam around the desolate town.
They are watching the girl and the boy.
The old man watches his enemies with pleasure.
There is no hostility in him.
How can he detest people who are not his enemies anymore?
For him, they are no different from rocks by the roadside.


But it's different for the white skull.
For him, an enemy is an enemy, no matter how weak they may be.
He will eliminate them if they stand opposed, and he will assassinate them if they are too strong to match.
That's his code, a rule he must obey.

"We can kill them here."
He tells his master.
The boy and the girl are full of openings.
In this land of death, they stand defenseless.
It only looks like sick people asking for death.
So he believes that he should be compassionate and kill them here.

But.
"No, that is too wasteful. We let them live until now, so it will be uninteresting to kill them here."
The old man has no compassion.
This thing that wears human form is rotten to the core.

"Hm. How about this scenario, Assassin?
 There is a sacrifice. A piece of meat that is ignored, cursed, and hated by the human world. This meat does not try to hate the world. It tries to not hate the world as long as it has at least one ally on its side."

"My, it seems love is precious and strong. The meat cannot hate the world no matter what happens to it. It's intently trying to suppress its mud, believing that hating equals denying its ally.
 So anything you do to the meat is ineffective. It accepts everything because it believes in the one and the only hope. It does not hate the world because it contains hope, and it does not let out the curse within it."

"Butwhat would happen if it were rejected by its only ally?
 From the start, it has been denied by the world. If it is betrayed by its only hope, there will be no morality to stop it."

"...Then you would like the boy to give the final push?"
"Exactly. He should be the one to draw the curtains. It was an unexpected growth, but he made it last so long. Then I should give him the pleasure of killing it."

The old man laughs.
Sadism and joy are contained in the laughter.
The chattering of the teeth is like a white skull shaking in the wind.
We return home before midnight.
It's because there's nothing we can do, and we can't afford to waste energy patrolling to no end.

My feet are heavy.
It seems the fatigue of the training is finally hitting my body.
My body is like lead, and my eyelids droop if I let my guard down.

...I'm sleepy.
My mind must be more tired than my body.
Every part of me craves sleep, and I want to pass out right here in the hallway.

"Welcome back. How was the town, Rin?"
Ilya is waiting in the living room.
...I don't see Sakura.
That's natural.
Because Sakura is...
"!"
No.
Sakura should be sleeping in her room.

"It was already over. How's Sakura?"
"Nothing happened. She's sleeping in her bed, and it doesn't seem like she woke up. I think she's doing well since she has spare magical energy from Rider not taking form."

"I see. But please be careful. It's over if she goes out of control again."
Tohsaka's tone is the same as ever.
Even after seeing those empty houses, she's acting normally.

"I'm going to sleep since I'm tired. What are you going to do, Ilya?"
"I'll rest as well. Tomorrow is iron making. We might fail if I don't get some good rest."
Ilya leaves with a "good night".

"Then I guess this is it for tonight. You should rest too, Shirou. I don't know if you can tell, but you're really pale."

...My body feels heavy.
 I can still lay out the futon in my current state, probably because it's a habit.


I fall onto the futon.
Looking up at the ceiling gives me enough composure to make me think.


I think with my weary mind.

I think about my left arm.
The loosened Shroud.
I was in so much fear and pain last night, but today was like nothing.
I have no memory of anything being painful or scary, and the day ended in a flash.
The answer's right there if I seriously think about it.

I think about Ilya.
She said she can't live with me.
She said she wants to, but can't.
She said she can't live long.
She said it as if it were common knowledge.

About that black shadow                                                            

I think about Sakura.
She is losing her freedom with each passing day.
It's because the crest worm is sucking the magical energy from her.
It's not Sakura's fault.
It's not her fault that her body's like that.
All I can do is to give my magical energy to her.
She should be able to maintain herself if I have sex with her and if I keep giving her magical energy.

I close my eyes.
Ilya said saving everyone is impossible.
I can choose only one.
I've already made my choice.

"...Senpai? Are you back...?"
I hear a voice from the hallway.

"I'm awake. Come in, Sakura."
I raise my body. I want to see Sakura even though my head's not working.

"Excuse me. I'm sorry, but I came since I heard sounds. ...Um, I never told you good night."

Sakura is like always.
She's reserved, considerate, doesn't say what she wants, is at a loss, and still smiles at me.
She became surprisingly beautiful in the past year, and she's so cute that I want to embrace her when we're alone. And she's someone I promised to keep protecting.

"Um, that's all. I feel well, thanks to you. I can sleep well tonight, so I wanted to tell you that there's nothing to worry about."

Sakura is like always.
But that's just a matter of course.
She can't be different.
There's no need to push myself and make love to Sakura tonight.
It's not as though Sakura's asking for it like that night.

"...Senpai? Um, am I disturbing you...?
 You look really tired and sleepy..."
"Sakura. Were you sleeping like I told you?"
"...?"
I just ask what's bothering me.
My tired head can't think at all.

"Yes, I was sound asleep.
 I saw another scary dream, but I was able to bear it since you were there until I fell asleep."

A scary dream.
I have to ask her what kind of dream it was, but...

I can't say anything, reaching out for her long hair instead.

"U-Um, Senpai...?"
"Come here, Sakura."
I lower my hand to her shoulder and pull her to me.

"U-Um, Senpai, I-I-I...!"
"I want to have sex with you tonight. You want to?"
I murmur, still embracing Sakura.

Sakura doesn't fight back, but buries her face in my chest.

"Yes. I'm very happy."
She relaxes and leans on me.

.
.
.
.

I have sex with her.
I can't hold it back.
I've done it with her twice, but her body is limitless and new, like I'm having sex with her for the first time.

There's no end to my lust.
There's no end to my urge.
From the start, my reason has been obliterated.
I don't want Sakura, but...

"......! Nha, ha!"
I just want to violate her.
I want to mercilessly thrust into her.
And I actually do.
Sakura's voice does not reach my brain.
I can only hear my violent breathing.

"I-It's goodSenpai, you're"
The sex was normal only at the start.
After that, I thrust my hips as if to break Sakura, and I kept ejaculating as if to make her explode.

If it's not enough, I just have to fill it up.
If it's not possible with one try, I just have to try more.
I'll keep it up until morning if that's what it takes.

"Fuaah, ah!"

I hear a beast's howl.
My brain only hears myself.
Then this wild, hungry voice must be mine.
It's Sakura that needs to be satisfied, but I want it more than her.

"Goodit's good, Senpai...! Please give it to me deeper, ahh, ah!"

There's no sense of time.
The morning is too far away.
I ejaculate again, and the power in my body disappears.
I tried to keep watching this dream until morning, but the power in my body goes off after two hours.

I fall asleep holding Sakura's hand.
"YesSenpai, I"
I feel Sakura's weight on my chest.
We feel each other's warmth as we fall asleep.

...The haze of lust clears from my mind.

What good did this do?
Maybe I merely confirmed my uneasiness by having sex with her
I'm seeing the scary dream again.

"Something" is walking.
Something scary that kills people whenever it walks.
...I'm watching it from behind.
I don't want to watch, but I can't look away.

This is a nightmare.
A nightmare I'm seeing over and over.

But to be honest, I feel a sense of intimacy with it.
It was scary at first, but I'm getting used to it after a while.
Most importantly, that thing does not have an evil mind.
That thing is something similar to me that merely eats in a different way.

"             "
"             "
"                       !"

...It's the same tonight.
Why do they all come?
Does it release some scent that attracts men?
No matter how many it kills, no matter how many days it continues to kill, the food comes to it.

It eats.
It smashed up the food when it first started, but it must be getting the hang of it recently.
There's no need to smash up the food.
It just needs to pull it in and swallow it.
It can eat the body and the soul like that.

Sing and go.
It's in a good mood tonight.
It has never shown any emotion, but it seems to be happy tonight.

I feel an affinity with it.
I'm very happy tonight too.
Because this is the first time.
Senpai asked for my body for the first time.
...Yes.
There's nothing to be afraid of now.
I keep seeing this nightmare, but it's all right.
The world looks so beautiful and kind now that Senpai's looking at me.

So I feel like continuing this bad dream, and going to look for another meal.
But...
"You are certainly working hard. Double the amount tonight?"
I meet someone that's scarier than the nightmare.

It runs.
The thing that never felt fear ran away from the person.
Golden hair and red eyes.
The person that has the same smell as me.
The golden Servant that...
"You should die now, girl. You will not be able to die if you become familiar with it."
...Warned me before to kill myself.

;  "       "
Run away.
                From what?
Run away.
                Who?
Run away.
                Why?

My dream doesn't end.
The thing panics and flees into the back alley.
But that's the end.
"I was hoping for a poorly-made Holy Grail, but I never expected to reach the actual thing. It is a waste, but..."

"I will do the selection myself. Curse yourself for being too compatible."
In an instant, the thing is showered with weapons.

...Huh?
That's strange. It hurts.
That thing is the one that was stabbed, so why am I in pain?
That thing is the one that's dead, so why am I on the ground?
I'm dreaming, so why

Why is my body cut up?

"Huh?"
It hurts.
It hurts even though this is a dream, Senpai.
Pink, squishy stuff is hanging obscenely from my stomach.

"Ithurts."
I try moving my hands to put my intestines back in, but my hands are only connected by flaps of skin.
Legsthere are legs, but I'm torn off from my waist down.

"No."
When I cry out, it hurts as if lightning hit my back.
But I can't jump up because I don't have my limbs.
Why am I...

"You're still alive? You're clinging to your life too miserably, girl."

He shows no mercy.
The golden man snaps his fingers, summons a blade that's bigger than my body, and comes to cut my neck.

"Ah"
A bad dream.
This is a bad dream.
This is like the bad dreams I've had.
This isn't happening, and I'll be in Senpai's house when I wake up.

...So I have to wake up soon.
Because it hurts.
It hurts so much that I could die, so if I don't wake up, I'll really

"AhAh, ah.........!!!!"
But I don't wake up.
I don't wake up from the dream.
Help.
Help, it hurts, help, help.
Quick, wake up, or I'll really

But I don't wake up.
I don't wake up from the dream.
The dream.
I can't escape from my dream, Senpai

And the woman falls.
The woman, pierced with numerous Noble Phantasms, crawls on the ground like a bug.

"Huh?"

She is still conscious.
Her life cannot be saved by any means, but she still frantically tries to move her limbs.

"You're still alive? You're clinging to your life too miserably, girl."
A scornful death sentence.
The golden mana heroic spirit called Gilgamesh mercilessly readies the final attack.

"...I don't want to die... Senpai finally accepted me... I want him to feel more of me"

She must not see anything now.
The woman babbles about her mundane wish.
Reaching out with an arm that's missing from the elbow down.
As if to cling to the small happiness she finally obtained.

"No... I don't want to die, I don't want to die...!
 BecauseBecause if I die now, Nee-san will..."

"That is unsightly. Do not trouble me."
The guillotine descends.
The dream ends.
Still covered in blood, the woman's consciousness disappears in the dirty back alley.

"Hm?"
By the time he turns around, it's too late.

"You have alrea-gah!!!???"
He is swallowed, beginning with his feet.
There's no way to run.
Because...

It takes longer than usual.

"...It hurts. It doesn't heal because it's not enough."

She starts to walk.
Her stomach is growling.
The only driving force in her brain is hunger.
Is she still not satisfied after consuming a heroic spirit with energy worth a few hundred thousand souls?

"...It's not enough. This isn't enough at all."

It's as if she's driven by a fever.
For the first time, she starts walking to the breeding area out of her own will.

"Haa."
My body's still heavy.
I have to make lunch for Sakura, but I want to rest a bit and clear my head.


I fall onto my futon, letting my face sink into the pillow.

...I know.
There wasn't any postponement since that day.
I can't postpone the problem anymore.
About Sakura.
I have to decide everything right now

"Emiya Shirou."

"Who is it!?"
I jump up.
A voice. I heard a voice.
I heard it from within this room.


A chill runs up my spine.
...The scary thing is that I still can't tell where in the room it's coming from.

"Do not be alarmed. I did not come to take your life."
A whisper by my ear.
The voice.
This fluent, yet alien, tone is of the Servant with the white skull.

"Assassin"
...How was it possible?
His specialty may be killing people, but he made it here without being noticed or setting off the boundary field around the house!?

"......You didn't come to kill me? Then you just want to talk?"

I search for the presence behind me while I measure the distance to the hallway.
It'll take two full steps, three full seconds to dash out to the hallway into the yard.
Assassin can kill me four times over in that time.
...Then my only way to live is to go along with him.

"Not I.  It is the magus who wishes to speak with you."
"...? Magus? You mean Zouken?"
"Yes. He is waiting for you at the Matou household. He has no desire to fight. He will welcome you if you go there alone."


...Assassin's words can be trusted to some degree.
If he wanted to kill me, he could've done it the instant he snuck into the room.

He didn't kill me because Zouken wants to talk to me.
That's not to say it isn't actually a trap, but
It's a trap.
It's obviously a trap.
But it's true that I might never have another chance to talk with Zouken one-on-one.

...And I don't really have a choice.
Even if it's a trap, I have to go see him and have him remove Sakura's crest worm.

"...All right. Zouken wants to talk to me, huh?"
"A wise decision. Let us make haste. Even I cannot deceive Rider's eyes for too long. The magus will change his mind if someone else realizes we're having this conversation."
"......Hah. So it's a secret meeting for my ears only, huh?"

...There's no reply.
His work must be done now that I've agreed.
Before I know it, Assassin has vanished.

I sneak out of my house to head to the Matou household.
The sky is filled with clouds.
Maybe it's because of the dark sky, but the house is filled with an ominous air.

I go inside without ringing the doorbell.
...It's been a year since I last came here.
I go through the hallway following my faint memory and head to the living room.

"Oh. You came earlier than I thought, Emiya's successor."

Zouken is the only one here.
I don't see Assassin or black Saber.
...It seems he really does want to talk with me.

"Hm? Oh, you don't even want to exchange greetings with me? My, you must hate me."
I feel no hostility from Zouken.
...In short, he's taking me lightly.
His composure is self-evident, confident in his ability to kill me at any time.

"Well. You must have something to talk about as well, since you've accepted my invitation. Sit down. It must not be something to discuss standing up."
"No way. Standing up is just fine for what we have to say."

...I suppress the urge to jump at him and punch him, and glare at him as if it could kill him.
Unlike Zouken, I can't hide my anger.
I won't let my guard down against the guy who changed Sakura's body.

"Zouken. If this is a discussion, I only have one thing to say.  Release Sakura right now."
That's the only business I have here.
I'll just fight if Zouken refuses.
I'll kill this monster before anything can happen, even if he calls for Assassin and Saber.

"Release Sakura, eh? ...Hm, I would like to, but I'm afraid I cannot do anything."
Then.
The old magus before me speaks in disappointed tones.

"What?"
"She cannot be saved no matter what I do, as it has grown too much. Sakura is already functioning as a Holy Grail. She will die even if I remove the crest worm right now."

Hold on.
Holy Grail? Sakura is functioning as a Holy Grail?
Why is he talking about the Holy Grail...?

"Wait. What do you mean by Sakura being the Holy Grail? What did you do to her...!?"

"I tampered with her to obtain the Holy Grail and make my wish come true.
 It is all for Makiri's dearest wish, to put shape to the soul, the true immortality. That is why I embedded the Holy Grail into Sakura after the war ten years ago."

"Whatyou embedded the Holy Grail...?"

"Right. You should have heard how the Holy Grail War ended ten years ago.
 Your father, Emiya Kiritsugu, destroyed the Holy Grail that was completed through the ritual we know as the Holy Grail War.
 The war ended, the summoning ritual a failure once again.
 Butit was not a total loss. The Holy Grail was completed, if only temporarily.
 Then it would be a waste to leave the broken fragments as they were."


My head quickly cools down.
In short, he took his granddaughter Sakura and...

"Yes. I embedded the Holy Grail within her. But I am no monster. I made sure she can function as a human. I knew it would be painful to have an inorganic substance in her, so I turned the shard of the Holy Grail into a living thing."

"Living thing... Then the crest worm in Sakura is..."
"It is something I created using the Holy Grail as catalyst.
 With that, her body became a container to receive the souls. It became a tool to become the gate when the ritual is completed.
 It is just a copy of the Holy Grail the Einzbern family makes.
 Well, I do not have as much skill as them, so I did about an eighth my own way."

He laughs.
...Copying Einzbern?
All he did was pick up a piece of a finished product and implant it within Sakura...!

"...You bastard! You can't make a Holy Grail, so you used a human being to make an imitation of the Holy Grail...!?"

"Experiment. It's just an experiment, heir to Emiya.
 This experiment is merely a stepping stone to the next. My plan was to slowly change her to something like a Holy Grail over several decades.
 It was supposed to be an experiment of Makiri's Holy Grail which lives as a human but still has the function to collect souls."

"Sakurais an experiment...?"

"Of course. Sakura was given to the Matou family for that reason.
 To give a daughter to the Matou family means giving us a foundation to achieve our goal. Tohsaka is well aware of that. We both have the same goals. We will both turn ourselves into monsters to achieve immortality."

"Immortality...?
 You and Tohsaka's father used Sakura for something ridiculous like that...!?"

"Of course. The Holy Grail War has always been a ritual dedicated to that end. That is the only reason we cooperated, and I am the only one who still lives.
 To use the Matou successor to achieve our goal in the far future."

"But fate can be quite ironic.
 Sakura was prepared to be an unadaptable Holy Grail, but she has shown surprising growth.
 My, I have gotten old. I never expected Sakura to have that much talent. Not only does she still live in spite of taking in so many Servants, but she still retains her sense of being Matou Sakura.
 She is a true Holy Grail, just like that of the Einzbern, which I thought was impossible to make myself."

"......!"
I can't hold it anymore.
I'm not patient enough to keep listening to the monster's nonsense.
Forgetting the possibility of Assassin's intervention...

"Enough of this bullshit...! You can't call something that only sacrifices human lives a Holy Grail!"
I let my anger take over and dash at Zouken with a raised fist.

But.
"It is a Holy Grail.
 First of all, even the Einzbern, who create the Holy Grail, used a human as their Holy Grail for this war."
"What?"
Zouken's smile stops me in my tracks.

"...Using a human?"
...My body wobbles back.
I hate myself for knowing who he's talking about, even though I don't want to understand.

"Right. Ilyasviel is also a Holy Grail.
 But do not consider us as the same. The Einzberns are far worse. You can ask her yourself what kind of a Holy Grail they prepared."


My upraised arm falls.
...Not only Sakura.
Even Ilya is the same, and regret takes over my body in place of anger.

"Well, I assume that was all you wanted.
 Then it is my turn now. The reason I called for you.
 I want to discuss the shadow with you."

"Wha"
Discuss the shadow...?
He must be talking about the black shadow that's attacking the people in this town.
But

"...What are you saying? That thing is on your side.
 So what do you need to talk about? Do you want us to beat it?"
I glower at Zouken, my voice thick with sarcasm.
"Kakaka, this simplifies matters!
 Yes, I want you to do something about that shadow. That is why I need your powers, Emiya Shirou."

"Whatare you serious...!? You guys are on the same side, right...!?"

"On the same side...? Well, I have helped it, but it has never helped me.
 I cannot even communicate with it.
 I merely arranged its path so it would not run wild. I calmed it down every night to minimize the damage it dealt, but as of last night, I can no longer continue.
 Did I not tell you? I cannot manage it anymore."


My heart thumps loudly.
'I cannot manage it anymore.'
Who is that directed to?

"Zouken."

"Ah, yes. I must tell you what that shadow is before anything else.
 In short, that is the content of the Holy Grail.
 People say the Holy Grail is an omnipotent pot, but the Holy Grail we aim for is not a pot. The Holy Grail is only a means.
 Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka.
 What the three families aim for is to open a gate using the complete Holy Grail.
 You can think of the complete Holy Grail as a gate to connect this world to a world where every wish comes true."

"...Hold on. Then the Holy Grail is..."
"Yes.  The goal of every magus is to reach the origin.
 But I am not interested in such a thing. The Einzberns only thought for the completion of the Holy Grail. Tohsaka is the only family of magi that is still aiming for the origin."

"...Anyway.
 The Holy Grail is a gate that connects to the wish machine. The shadow is something that has leaked from the other side.
 The real Holy GrailIlyasviel would not have done such a thing. That shadow is a mistake made by the imitated Holy Grail."

"Well, I do not like to talk about the shame of my family, but it seems I did not discipline her well enough.
 She matured as a Holy Grail, but it would appear she cannot shut the gate properly. I do not mind if she dies from her own carelessness, but I cannot have her involve other people.
 What a bother... the Holy Grail I made might kill everyone in this town."

Matou Zouken shakes his head, as if it's someone else's problem.


I should punch him for saying that.
But his words turn my emotions to ice.

"Then that black shadow is..."
Truly...
"You should already know. That thing is Sakura's shadow. You should recognize the similarities between them."
...Matou Sakura herself?


...I fight off the dizziness.
...The truth...
I accept the connection I've already known but denied.
No matter what that black shadow may be...
I have to accept that the crime is Sakura's as well

"Does Sakura"
"No, she should not know about it.
 That thing is the Holy Grail's shadow that appears through Sakura. It originally should not have form, but when it passed through the gate called Sakura, it took Sakura's form and obtained a body.
 The Holy Grail borrowed Sakura's sealed id to come into this world."

"It was beyond my expectations to be honest. I denied it since it was impossible, but I have to accept it now that it is getting stronger by the day.
 That thing is a Holy Grail with a will. That is why it keeps consuming human souls to complete itself.
 There is only one way to stop it. If the Holy Grail is born from Sakura's unconsciousness, you merely need to stop Sakura."

"I tried to persuade Sakura, but the shadow does not want me going near her.
 It does not have a will of its own, but that shadow is Sakura herself. It hates whoever she hates.
 I cannot even go near Sakura anymore."

"......What? Then you can't get close to Sakura?"
"No. You people think Sakura is under my control, but that is all in the past. She is already yours. I cannot control her, as I have been cut off from her."

"........."
It's something I can be happy about.
At the very least, Zouken can't do anything to Sakura.
Then if we can do something about the crest worm

"Wait. You haven't done anything to Sakura?"
"No, nothing at all."
"Then, Sakura's still in pain, because..."

"That's her own problem. I have never used the crest worm. She is breaking down because she is a Holy Grail and the powers of the Holy Grail are flowing into her.
 Think about it. There is a great swirl of magical energy that can grant any wish. Her human body must receive what flows from that source. There is no way Sakura's weak mind can endure the strong onflow."

"Whathen Sakura will..."
"Unable to bear the strain of being a Holy Grail, she will explode.
 No, if Sakura's consciousness empties, the Holy Grail should appear. She might be swallowed by her own shadow."

"Do you understand? It is meaningless to kill me here.
 The Holy Grail War ends once you defeat me. At that point, all that remains is for the Holy Grail to activate. Sakura's mind will be obliterated once that happens.
 If you want to save her, endure for the duration of the Holy Grail War. The timing to open the gate, the completion of the Great Holy Grail, does not last long.
 It has already been ten days since the war began. Judging from the past wars, this war should end in about four more days."

"Four days. Are you saying Sakura will survive if four days pass?"
"Who knows? That is for you to determine. How was she this morning? Do you think she will last four more days?"
"! She will. Of course she'll make it."

"I see, I see.
 But the same cannot be said for the other people. How many disappeared last night? How many will disappear tonight?
 Nohow many days do you think it will take for the whole town to be consumed?"

I can't really hear his question.
Does this man sound happy or sad?
My head is shaking so much that I can't tell.

Defeating Zouken won't solve the problem.
Sakura won't last until the Holy Grail War ends.
We can't beat that black shadow.
The people in town will continue to die as long as the Holy Grail War continues.
"...Then how..."
Can I save Sakura?

Then...
"It's simple. You just need to kill Sakura."
Zouken states the obvious.


"I am correct, am I not? She cannot survive even if you let her live, and the black shadow will attack people again tonight. Kill her right now to prevent that."
I feel dizzy.


"That is what I wish to discuss. I wanted to inform you of the current situation. I wanted to tell you that you are protecting the greatest disaster."
I feel like vomiting.


"Sakura will notice Tohsaka's daughter or me. But she will gladly give her life if it's for you."
I can't breathe.


"Ending one evil life to save thousands.
 You should know. If you are to carry out Emiya Kiritsugu's will, Matou Sakura is your enemy."
My mind isn't working at all.

I walk down the distorted hallway, unable to give a reply.
I don't feel anything even when I walk or lean against the wall.
It's ugly.
It feels like I'm in a twisted nightmare without an exit.

I go outside, still forgetting to breathe.

"You will not make the wrong choice. It is a pity for Sakura, but this is fate."

...I walk.

"But I will thank you in my granddaughter's place.
 She has never done anything for herself. She never cursed herself for being thrown away by her father. She did not wish to be almighty like her older sister. She was a mere puppet."

...I walk.
...I walk.

"The puppet was able to sleep with the man it loved. Surely, it must be satisfied.
 Do not condemn yourself too much. You gave my pitiful granddaughter a gift in the end."

...I walk.
...I walk.
...I walk.
I stumble towards my house, where Sakura is waiting.

I walk down the hill.
I'll reach the Emiya household once I go up the usual hill.

I can't leave my room empty forever.
No matter what the reason may be, I secretly met with Zouken.
It's not good to let Tohsaka or Sakura know about it.
So I have to go home before they notice.
Go home and...

I have to make a decision.

"!"
The contents of my stomach come up to my throat.
I chose to ally with Sakura.
I swore to protect her no matter what.
I chose to be with Sakura instead of becoming a superhero.
But that means...

Allowing another disaster to occur, taking hundreds of lives.


I can't do that.
I can't do that.
Emiya Shirou cannot break that oath.
It is like denying myself.

If you, the only one to survive that tragedy, are to allow the tragedy...
You will be rejected by everything that has supported you until now.

No matter the end.
Your crime will never be forgiven.


To not do anything means silently approving of the action.
There are innocent people who will be killed tonight.
If you know that, but still will not kill the cause...
You are no different than the cause of the fire that day.

'If you deny what you have been until now to protect one person...'

'Will you be on my side no matter what?'

This is a choice between protecting one person or protecting everyone besides that person.
Who will I side with in the end?
I have to decide by tonight.
It's obviously a trap.
I'm curious about what Zouken wants to discuss, but I can't be away from Sakura right now.

"I refuse. I can't trust you. Tell him to come to me if he wants to talk."
"I see. Then I shall tell him so."

...I don't hear Assassin's voice after that.
He must already be out of my house, heading back to Zouken.

"...This is fine. This should be all right."
Even if I can face off against Zouken, I have no way to kill him.
First of all, he's a monster one can't talk with.
I have to have all the weapons ready if I am to confront him.

"Gem sword, huh?"
The secret weapon Tohsaka and Ilya are trying to make.
Even Archer's arm, which remembers close to a thousand swords, has no information on such a weapon.

"...But we can win if we can reproduce it. I can believe in you, right, Tohsaka?"
I lie down on the tatami.
...I'm tired, so I'll sleep.
After I wake up, I'll go see Sakura, prepare dinner, and help Tohsaka

"......Hm."
Dinner's presence wakes me up.
Does dinner have a presence?  Of course it does. Like the sound of a knife on the cutting board, the sound of the TV, and the good smell of the food.

"Huh?"
In my room are Sakura's pajamas, an empty bowl, and a wet towel.


I search through my memory.
Looking at what's here, it seems I went and treated Sakura.
I try to remember, but I stop myself.
These are trivial things.
I must've forgotten about them somehow, so I don't even need to think about it.

Tohsaka is the one preparing dinner.
Sakura and Ilya aren't here.
They must be in the guest rooms.

"Oh, you're back? You just went out, saying you were tired and wanted to rest."

My face stiffens for a second.
"No, I'll help. You must be tired as well, so I can't let you do all the work."
I try to respond naturally so I won't sound suspicious.

"Are you stupid? I appreciate the offer, but you can't use the knife with that arm of yours. Just let me handle it tonight."
She starts cutting.
She must be stir-frying vegetables, as she's cutting lots of green peppers.

"...I see. Then I'll go prepare the bath. Oh, I guess I'll do the laundry while I'm at it. Can I go get your laundry?"
"W-Why are you saying such a stupid thing!? I'm going to do that myself, of course...!"
She slams the knife down on the cutting board.
She's dicing up some beef.  I guess we're having meat tonight.

"What's she making?"
I head to the bath.
I don't know what she's going to make, but I'm looking forward to

"...?"
The lights go off.
"Is it a blackout...?"

"...I guess so. The switches aren't responding."
"...Yeah. The boundary field hasn't been activated, so it's not an intruder."
"Yeah, even if Zouken attacks us, the boundary field will"

Not necessarily be activated.
Remember what happened this morning.
Assassin was able to pass through the boundary field without any difficulty!

"Stay here, Tohsaka. I'm going to go check, just in case."
"Hey, hold on. I'll go too. It's dangerous to go by yourself."

"Oh, yeah. ...No, then please go check on Sakura. I'll head there right after I go get Ilya."
"Okay. You can leave Sakura to me."

I hurry to Ilya's room.
It's dead quiet, but the house feels normal.
"Maybe I'm thinking too much. This is just an ordinary power outage."
Well, I guess I'll go wake up Ilya while I'm at it.
Even though the power failure interrupted the preparations, it's almost dinnertime.

"Are you awake, Ilya?"
I open the door.

Only scattered red comes into my view.

"Ilya."
Ilya isn't here.
All that's left are traces of blood.
In the corner of the room, admist the splattered blood, are minced flesh and a bundle of silver hair, but that's not Ilya.
Ilya is not human anymore.

I jump out of the room.
I cool down my head that's about to  and head to the guest room.
Sakura's in danger.
I grasp the situation in a second, but I haven't actually grasped the situation at all, and I jump out into the yard.

There...
...Stands something that should not exist.

"Ah"
It's like a ghost under a willow.
Why the boundary field did not go off.
Why such a thing is here.
Before I can answer these questions...
There was no time to run, and there was nowhere to run.
The house is already engulfed by the shadow.
If that is the shadow itself, there is no way to escape the dark night.

I've known it since last night.
I will be killed the instant I meet it.

The tentacle pierces my chest like a crowbar.
It mercilessly rips me open.
Blood gushes while my ribs bloom out like a flower.
Ilya must have suffered the same fate.

The flower petals flutter about.
Kocher. Here.
Scalpel. Here.
Unable to fight back, Emiya Shirou's body is prepared for cooking with no anesthetic
And it's the night I have to make my decision.

We won't be patrolling the town anymore.
Tohsaka spent the whole day making the gem sword and is now resting, completely exhausted.
The same goes for Ilya.
The three of us ate dinner silently and went back to our own rooms.

It's ten o'clock.
...The shadow should go into action soon.


I get up soundlessly.
I grab the knife I got from the kitchen and leave my room.

The door isn't locked.
I open the door without a sound and walk to the bed.


Sakura's sleeping.
That's all I can tell.
I can't tell if she's getting better or worse.

There's something wrong with my vision.
I can't even see Sakura's face even when she's sleeping right before me.

", "
I suppress my dizziness and trembling.
Prepare yourself.
That shadow might be attacking people while I hesitate.

If there's no way to directly kill it, I have to  Sakura here.
Even if it's not Sakura's fault, people are harmed.
There will be victims.
There will be people who could not prevent the harm.
...And Sakura will commit crimes she does not want to commit.


I raise the knife.
My mouth is dry.
It feels like my tongue's turned into a piece of cardboard.
The inorganic knife sends a chill up my spine.

My eyes become numb as I think about sticking this thin scrap of metal, whose only reason of existence is its sharpness, into a living human's throat, Sakura's soft flesh.
It's like stumbling and falling eye-first onto a flathead screwdriver.
The blinding pain of numbness peels the cerebral membrane like an orange peel.


There's something wrong with my senses.
The fingers holding the knife look as if they're all bending in the wrong way.
It looks like psychic powers in movies.
I ignore it and tighten my grip.

I...
I bring the knife down.
...Sakura doesn't move.
Her eyelids are shaking in fear, but she doesn't try to move away.


I drop the knife onto her white neck.
It slices it right open.
Is there a fire?
The red blood sharply splatters against the wall like a fire hose.

"Haah."
I drop to my knees.
...I hear wheezing sounds.
The splashing noise is coming not from Sakura's throat, but from my own.

...I see.
Even if Sakura has accepted her death, she won't allow it.
I tried to use the knife against the defenseless Sakura, and she attacked with her dagger, because I was even more defenseless.

"............"
I don't feel any pain.
Rather, I feel relieved.
...But regret remains like the bloodstain.
After I exit the stage...
Who will atone for Sakura's sin?

My heart hurts.
Blood drips down my fingers where they grasp the knife.

"!"
I grit my teeth.
I frantically swallow against the sob rising in my throat.

", !"
My eyes are hot.
I can't manage it looking down, so I tilt my face up and restrain my anger.

...Pushing the knife down.
I can't do something so simple.
I'm pissed.
There's something really wrong with me.
I had to come this far before I realized my own feelings.

"Am I stupid?"
...Right.
I had the answer already.
My path was set the moment I embraced Sakura under the rain.

      'Are you going to betray?'

Someone tells me to remember.
Wasn't I going to become a superhero?
My body is wracked by contradictory thoughts.

A superhero that will let many people die tonight for Sakura's sake.
A selfish superhero.

Kiritsugu threw away his own wishes to pursue what he believed in.
A powerless human that helps others just because of self-interest.

The fire ten years ago.
Because I was the only one who survived, I lived on, swearing never to let such a disaster occur again.

All the time until now.
The idea I believed in for ten years is piercing my heart.
Asking if I am betraying it.
Will I betray myself, who cried and tried to live on, ignoring the voices of the people who died helplessly?

The atonement.
Am I going to betray my previous self, who had to cling to that atonement to continue living?

"Yes"

No apologies will ever bring me forgiveness.
I can't make amends for this crime.
I'm throwing myself away.
Even if my life turns out to be a fake after losing what I've believed in until now...

"I will betray them."

I'll choose what I want to protect.
In the future.
If Sakura's smile is there, I won't even care if I have to live by deceiving myself.

...There's nothing wrong with it.
I need Sakura.
Sakura needs me.
For the first time...
I wish to protect one life instead of many.

"............"
I take a deep breath and loosen my fingers on the knife.
I won't lose my way anymore.
I'll pull the knife back and leave before Sakura wakes up.

And right when I'm about to...
"Senpai. Why won't you kill me?"
Sakura talks in the dark.

"Sakura."
She's awake.
Sakura is lying there trembling, watching the upraised knife.

...Her eyes are clouded painfully.
It's not sadness about having me kill her.
She's apologizing for making me resort to this.

"It's fine, please do as you wish. I'm too scared to do it myself, but I don't mind if you do it."

Is she serious?
I hear fear in Sakura's voice.
Her body is trembling, her eyes fixed on the knife above her as if watching inevitable death.
...It's...
...It's a determination that's doing all it can to keep her from running away.

"Sakura."

...How can it be?
I was so preoccupied that I didn't even notice it?
Sakura's trembling.
Why didn't I realize Sakura's determination!?

"Sakura, I..."
"I know. What you decided is probably right.
 Because I'm at fault here.
 ...I'll say it now, since this is the end. I don't know how long I can remain myself.
 I don't know how long the day is, what I talked to you about at noon, when that noon was, what happened yesterday, and what tomorrow is."

"That's not all. I see strange dreams. It's a scary dream. I'm always covered in blood, but a part of me finds it pleasant, and everything about it is scary."

"I'm the bad guy in that dream. I'm laughing as I'm stealing a lot of things from everybody.
 ...I was scared, asked for help, but nobody helped me."

"So I told myself it can't be helped that everyone's getting killed.
 They won't help others, so it's natural that others won't help them, and I ignored everything, thinking it's just a dream."

"...But I was wrong. I wanted that dream.
 I'm actually cowardly, filthy, cunning...
 I hated everyone, and all I could do was curse them. It's my fault for thinking that dream was pleasant, even for a second.
 It's not the dream that's bad. It's me, the one who watches it, that should never have existed."

"Senpai. I'm slowly breaking down.
 At this rate, I'll see nothing but those dreams and forget about you. I'll be a villain for real, going around and killing people."

"Soplease.
 ...If you can finish it here before I become the bad guy, then"
Sakura tries to say she'll be saved.

But.
"Oh"
I silence her with an embrace.


I hold her to me tightly.
...The embrace I could not accomplish before.
I pull her to me with the arms that only touched her back then.
I hold Sakura's body with all my strength.

"......Senpai."
...Sakura doesn't resist.
She's scared of dying, yet she asked to be killed. But, at last, she relaxes and...
"......No, you'll regret it..."
She says the same exact words as that night, as if thanking me.

"...It's too late.
 It's not about the future. I regret not being able to protect you all this time."
...A quiet sobbing.
Sakura puts her arm on my shoulder.
Her cold fingers run across my cheek.

"I'll protect you. I'll protect you, Sakura."
I promise Sakura as she cries.
...That's all I can do.
That's the only thing I can repeat to forgive each other.

I swore to be Sakura's superhero on that night.
I have no regrets.
I won't complain about this choice.
If anyone deserves an apology, it's only one person.

Will you forgive me, Sakura?
I don't say it out loud.
For betraying myself?
And I confess my crime.
It all happened ten years ago.
I kept pursuing the responsibility for being the only survivor in the fire.

  'Are you going to      ?'

I never forgot about it.
I survived, so I...

  'Are you going to betray?'

...I swore never to let such a thing happen again.
I made an oath with myself to become a superhero like Kiritsugu.
Emiya Shirou's days were turned to that sole purpose.
I let others use me so that I could hold my head up high before those who were not saved, and I made it this far because of that.

I know.
I know fully well.
But you...

  'Are you going to betray your previous self?'

You know the cause.
You already know who you must defeat.
The black sun.
If the shadow in the sky is the cause, you must kill it before it happens again.

"Ah"
Remember. What have you lived for until now?
You have approved of yourself because you save innocent people, because you save people who ask for help.
But if you are going to deny it just for one girl...

'If you are going to betray it...'

Emiya Shirou will be judged by himself

"It's morning."
I wake up.
It's bright outside, and it's past seven already.


My body feels heavy.
My limbs feel numb.
My dull head can't remember who I am.

"Oh. What do you want for breakfast, Sakura?"
I pat Sakura, sleeping beside me.
For a strange reason, I remember why she's there next to me.
The fact that the girl I love is sleeping next to me is probably more important than my identity.

"It's morning, Sakura. We have to get up, or breakfast and Tohsaka"
I tap her shoulder.
...Sakura's cold.
Not her attitude, but her sensation is cold, and she's also hard.

"......Sakura?"
I raise my body and look around the room.


She's not here.
We slept together and I held on to her hand, but Sakura is nowhere in the room.

"Sakura!"
She is nowhere to be seen.
The guest room is silent.

I feel no presence in the living room.
"Haa, !"
My body doesn't move well. I hit my foot on the table.
I fall, pull myself up using the wall, and head to the hallway.

". , "
I must be in a hurry.
There's nothing wrong with my body, but my mind isn't calm at all.
Why am I rushing, and why am I feeling so uneasy?
I'm trying to think, but whenever I do, it's like my thoughts are ten seconds in the future.

I can't think?
Or does my brain not recognize what I'm thinking?
Blood won't flow to my head, so I can't even tell.

", , "
I can't remember what I want to do.
But I'm relieved when I see Sakura's shoes at the front door.
Tohsaka's shoes aren't there, but Ilya's shoes are.
...Which means...

"......Um, her shoes are not there, so..."

                                                                                                                                                                                          .

"Yeah. Tohsaka's the only one outside, so it means Sakura's in the house."
Oh, so that's why I feel relieved.
Sakura hasn't gone anywhere.
All right, I'm getting sharper.
So yeah, Sakura just woke up before me, so she's probably doing something like washing her face, preparing breakfast, training in the dojo, or doing the laundry in the yard.

"Man, I got worked up over nothing."
I sigh and head back to the living room.
"Eh, Shirou!?"
Tohsaka comes running inside.

"What, Tohsaka? Are you taking a walk?"
"I'm not that easygoingno, we can talk later!
 Sakura's collapsed outside, so carry her in! I'll prepare the treatment!"
The clock ticks.
It's past nine o'clock.
It's been two hours since I carried Sakura in from where she'd collapsed by the entrance.
Function is finally returning to my numbed mind.

"Have you calmed down, Shirou?"
"Yeah, I'm fine now. I'm sorry for worrying you, Ilya. I don't remember what happened the last two hours, so I don't remember what kind of stupid things I may have done."

"Hmm, you didn't do anything. You carried Sakura inside, then held her hand while Rin treated her. She didn't have any external wounds, and you just sat down once you found out it was only a high fever."

"I see. Where's Tohsaka? I think she took Sakura to her room."
"Rin was checking out the closet earlier.
 Oh, she must've been looking for Sakura's clothes. She was dirty and sweaty, so you have to change her clothes before you can put her to bed."


I see.
It makes sense, now that she says it.
...Then I must still be in the living room because...

"Hey. Why are you following us when I'm about to change her clothes?"
Tohsaka probably said something like that to me.

"...Hm."
Sakura and I are in a relationship, so I should be able to change her clothes.
I can, but I think it's different to get naked out of your will and having someone take your clothes off when you're unconscious.
I'd be embarrassed if somebody changed my clothes while I was sleeping, so Tohsaka's completely right.

"So I've been waiting for two hours, huh? I might've been in a panic, but..."
I feel very stupid.
What's going on?
There are many things I have to think about.
Sakura's well-being.
The big meal the enemy had last night.

...No, that can come later.
I should be thinking about why Sakura was collapsed outside when we went to sleep together


I feel sick.
My mind refuses to think.
The blank two hours.
My body remembers that I've been pondering that problem for all that time.

"Shirou. Don't try to remember something you can't.
 You didn't forget it, but it went away. There's only pain even if you try to find what's not there."
"EhIlya?"
"...It's nothing. I was just talking to myself, so forget it."
Ilya looks away and shuts her mouth.

A few minutes after that.
When the clock is about to strike ten...
"Thanks for waiting. Sakura's awake now."
Tohsaka enters, acting like nothing's happened.

"...Tohsaka. Is Sakura all right?"
"I don't know. You should go ask her yourself. There's nothing for me to say."
"...All right. I'm going."
I get up.
I leave Ilya and Tohsaka in the living room and head to Sakura's room.

"Good. You're here, Senpai."
Sakura is breathing hard.
But she speaks the instant she sees me.

"Of course I'll come, you idiot. I'll go anywhere for you if you collapse. Tohsaka got the job this time, but it's me that should be treating you."

I get the chair and sit down.
I try to sit level with Sakura, who's lying on the bed.

"So, how are you doing? Tohsaka didn't tell me anything."
"Oh, I see. So Nee-san is keeping quiet."

"No. She said I should ask you. She's being considerate, huh?"
"Oh, you seem happy, Senpai. I thought so for a while, but you like the strict part of Nee-san, right?"

"Y-Y-Y-Y-You idiot, that's not true!
 Tohsaka's a steady girl, but I don't want to deal with that all the time. First of all, we can't manage unless she's considerate at times like these."

Sakura nods, smiling.
Her satisfied expression dispels my uneasiness somewhat.

"...Good. I guess you're all right. What was Tohsaka saying, Sakura?"
"Um, I'm just exhausted and malnourished, with a light fever.
 There's nothing to worry about if I'm resting, so she told me I have to stay in bed all day."


She's still breathing hard.
...Just lying there must be painful.
She's probably trying to breathe normally so she doesn't worry me.

"I see. Then keep resting. Um, you have enough magical energy, right?"
"Oh... y-yes! U-Um, you were amazing last night, so I have enough."


Even though I'm the one that asked, I still blush.
...But this is something I have to know.

"Then you'll get well right away if you eat something good and nutritious. I'll put in my best efforts for today's lunch."
I roll up my sleeve in a show of confidence.
But...

"...I'm sorry. I should be cooking for you.
 ...If I could just stand up, I could help you. I hate that I can't even do that."
...It seems my words hurt her.


...That's right.
Sakura is concerned about her role.
She knows she can't do anything, so she just tries to be the normal Matou Sakura.
But she can't even manage something as simple as that.

"Well, just bear it for now. A sick person has to rest like one. After all, I'm going to leave you in charge of breakfast, lunch, and dinner once you get well. You'll regret not resting more then."

I jokingly say what I plan to do.
...Yeah.
I can leave her in charge of cooking for about half a year if that'll please her.

"Really? You can't take it back later, okay?"
"I'm serious. I won't do anything for at least half a year.
 Well, I'd like to at least keep watch on the food on the gas burner when you need help."
I've been standing in the kitchen for eight years.
I don't feel at ease unless I'm holding a pan or something.

"Okay, then it's a promise. Please eat my meals once I get well."
"Yeah. I'll promise you all you want."

I get up.
I can't keep talking to her and tire her.
We were able to talk, and I know Sakura's doing fine.
I should let her rest now.

"Then I'll see you later. I'll come here again during lunch, so sleep until then."
I step away from the bed.
Sakura nods silently.

"Oh yeah, Sakura."
I stop at the door and call out to her without turning around.

"Yes? What is it, Senpai?"
"Oh, I was wondering why you were collapsed in front of the house.
 You were sleeping in my room, right?"
I try to ask as naturally as I can.
After a faint gasp...

"I was taking a morning walk. I woke up early, so I went outside, but then I collapsed.
 Nee-san's right. I shouldn't be going outside right now."
...She replies as naturally as I asked her.
Tohsaka and Ilya aren't there when I return.
"...They must've gone to their rooms."

Oh, yeah.
They're busy trying to reproduce the gem sword.
I can only help after they make a replica similar to the original.
My job for now is to draw out as much of Archer's experience as I can.

"I am the bone of my sword, huh?"
...Archer's original spell, which flowed into me along with the pain.
If I use this strangely familiar incantation to look within myself, my rate of success greatly increases.
Projection now succeeds half the time.
I'm copying Archer to make a copy of something.

"But I can only create a fake."
...Projection is reproducing something identical to the original.
Emiya Shirou can only create an inferior imagination.
The only way to create a phantasm is with the arm's help.

"!"
Suicide.
It's not that poison will come into me once I use it.
A bomb will be switched on once I use it.
A sure end will come once I use it.

An image of a firing hammer.
There's a gun in my brain.
The muzzle is pointed outward, but the trigger is still there.
This image must be the time bomb Kotomine spoke of.

"But if I can take the gun out of my head, the switch won't go off even if I use it."
No, the switch itself will be outside my body.


That's the best solution.
But of course, I have no idea how to do that.

"Oh yeah, the news."
I turn the TV on.
I have to know what happened yesterday, so I watch the news.

It's easy to find the right channel.
They're all talking about that incident.

The unexplained disappearances.
There are over forty houses with missing residents.
None of the survivors noticed their neighbors' disappearance.
And almost sixty people will never return.


I memorize each missing person's name as it appears.

One by one.
I engrave the strangers' names in my mind.

And I replace the names with people I know.

"!"
Will you be able to forgive it?
Will you still be able to forgive it when the time comes?
Will you be able to forgive the thing that's causing it?
Will you be able to forgive yourself for overlooking it?

"........."
The crime.
If I cannot protect it from the crime...
It will be painless salvation to stop it before it commits any more crime

The TV switches off.
The news that has been informing me of the incident is...

"Don't be stupid.
 We're not decent enough people to mourn over what's already done."
...Mercilessly cut off by Tohsaka.

"Tohsaka."
"Here, I brewed some tea, so drink up. I have nothing to do because Ilya wants to be alone."

Tohsaka places the teacup on the table.
Her reasoning doesn't sound right.
So I don't have to do what she tells me to, but...

"I'll drink the tea."
"Yeah. But it's so hot that it'll burn your tongue."
"I see. That's even better. Thanks, Tohsaka."

"...Heh. I just wanted to get myself together. You just happened to be here, okay?"
If this is how she wants to show her concern for me, I'll just have to accept it.

Time passes.
We just drink the tea silently.


I don't feel nervous for some reason.
I rather feel relaxed.
...This is purely speculation, but...
Could Tohsaka be one of those girls that soothes the atmosphere?

"Hah."
"W-Why are you smiling all of a sudden? Tell me if you want to say something."

"Oh, I was thinking to myself. We've never sat around doing nothing like this, right?
 Whenever we're together, we talk about the Holy Grail War. So I thought we had a pretty savage relationship."

"I-I can't help it. That's how it all started! Or what? Do you want me to talk about what might come up on the finals or what stores I like to go to?"
"Huh? I guess it's fine as is. I think this dangerous relationship is suited for us."
But we were so relaxed that it felt weird and funny.

"Well, you're right. That's how it all started.
 We started talking with each other after we became Masters, and I wouldn't have gotten to know you unless I became a Master."

Well, that's one good result I got from becoming a Master.
I can fight alongside the girl I've admired.

"That's not entirely true. I don't know about you, but I've known you for quite a while."
"Huh?"
Tohsaka blushes, saying something I can't ignore.

"Y-You knew me?"
Tohsaka nods with embarrassment.

"N-No way...! Did we talk when we were in the first year!?"
"N-No.
 I knew about you, but you didn't know about me.
 You're one of my traumas."

"W-Why!?"
I don't like that.
I know it can't be helped to hurt someone when you don't know about it.
But it's not good for my mental health to know that I've hurt Tohsaka, who likes to strike back three or four times as hard!

"I'm the one who wants to ask that.
 ...Fine, this is a good opportunity, so let me grumble a bit.
 It happened around this time four years ago. I don't know why, but you were there after school, doing running high jumps until the sun set, right?"

"Huh?"
I'm taken aback by the unexpected question.
It's not the question itself.
What surprised me is that Sakura was talking about the exact same thing.

"Yeah. So what?"
"I was watching that. I was right by the school entrance. I was an idiot watching another idiot who kept trying to jump a height he couldn't clear."


Hold on.
That can't be.
Sakura was the one watching me, and first of all...

"I-It was just a coincidence, okay? I went to your school because of a matter related to the Student Council. I was in a different school, let alone class."
"Yeah. I heard that you went to the same school as Issei."

"Yeah, we've known each other since then. I was the vice-president and he was the president. After four years spent fighting, we found out that we can't get along."

"...I see. So it was a long relationship."
I finally understand now.
I knew Issei's attitude towards Tohsaka was not normal.
Well, the mystery is unraveled... actually, it seems even more tangled now.

"Anyway, I just happened to see you keep trying to jump over a height you couldn't.
 That's all. That's when I first saw you, and I found out later that Sakura came to this house. I didn't know your name until then, and I forgot about your face."

...Well, now I know how she knew me.
"Um, is that something traumatic?"

"Humph. It's revenge after four years.
 Sakura joined the archery club a year ago, right? So I went and watched when I got the chance. And I happened to see someone who wasn't a club member shooting arrows.
 I knew right away that you were the idiot from that time."

I want to say something about what she thought about me, but I stay quiet.

"...And I was shocked at that time. There was this stranger who went to a different school that I'd considered stupid all this time, but I remembered him even after three years.
 And I finally realized that you've been giving me damage all this time.
 I found out I was jealous of this guy that kept on running like an idiot."

"Why? He was stupid, right? That's not someone you should be jealous of."

"Yeah. I probably wasn't jealous of him, but I felt Iike I'd lost. ...It would've been fine if he'd had hope of clearing that bar. I would've just gone home if that were the case."

"...But even he knew it was impossible.
 He knew nothing would change that, but he kept trying. It's as if he believed the effort was what mattered."

"...To be honest, I can't do such a thing.
 I've always been like that. I determine whether or not something is possible. If I know it's impossible for me, I quickly give up. I don't try what I can't do, and I never regret it or think I'm powerless because of it.
 I'm cold like that. I'm a terrible person. Kirei called it machine-like instead of cruel."

But Tohsaka isn't belittling herself.
She's proud of how she is.

"But I do sometimes think how pure it'd be to just keep trying without a thought for whether it's possible."

"...Well, as a child, it's shocking to see someone that's completely the opposite of you, right?
 That's why it was traumatic. That guy who foolishly kept running was..."

Someone I was happy to know existed.
Tohsaka murmurs with a dreamy expression.

"Oh, that was boring talk. Maybe I'm being nervous because things aren't going well."
Tohsaka gets up, as if saying the break's over.

"I'm going back to my room. I'll be creating the framework with Ilya in the afternoon, so you go watch Sakura."
She puts her cup in the sink and heads to the hallway.

...But.
"Hey. How was Sakura?"
She stops and asks, as if she's just remembered.

"She seemed well. She still has a fever, but it's better than the last time she collapsed.
 Sakura is calm as well. She pushed herself to do things around the house, but she's being obedient and resting today.
 That being the case, I'm sure she'll be better in no time."

"Of course she's staying still.
 She can't get up by herself now."

"What?"
She can't get up by herself now...?
"Why? She should have enough magical energy. Then shouldn't she have enough physical energy as well?"

"Yes, she has more than enough magical and physical energy. But it's terrible inside.
 ...I don't know what happened last night, but she definitely died once. That's the only sound explanation for why the muscles in her limbs are so badly damaged."

"...No way. She didn't have any external wounds."
"...It's just that it's cleanly connected on the outside.
 I don't know if the crest worm ripped her apart, or if someone else tore her limbs. ...If something really did tear her body apart, the pain would have destroyed her sanity.
 ...Let me ask. Did she recognize you?"


I swallow my affirmation.
...Tohsaka's expression is agonized.
Then that means...

"...Sakura didn't recognize you?"
"She did. She knew me, and she called me Nee-san.
 But she wasn't looking at me, but was looking at the Tohsaka Rin she imagined.
 ...Yeah, I really wanted to kill her when she said things like 'nice to meet you' and 'I wanted to meet you sooner.'"
Tohsaka looks away as her words turn cold.

...Wanted to kill?
...Tohsaka felt murderous intent against Sakura?

"In short, I can't do it.
 I can't protect Sakura until the very end like you, and I don't intend to either."
"Tohsaka."

"I told you, right? I don't do impossible things.
 As long as I'm Tohsaka Rin, I'll kill Sakura the moment I determine that it's not possible to let her go on. Well, I don't need to say it again because that was our deal all along, but I thought I'd remind you."

"You don't need to say anything. I know how you feel, and even if you say something, it won't accomplish anything.
 We're allies while we fight against Zouken, but we're enemies when it comes to Sakura. If you don't like it, we have to defeat Zouken as quickly as possible.
 ......But Shirou. What will you do if Zouken and the shadow are two separate enemies?"


I shut my mouth.
Tohsaka's question is so sharp that it makes me dizzy.

"Shirou. I'll kill her when the time comes. That's the best choice for both of us.
 You think about it too."
Tohsaka leaves.
She goes back to her room, leaving me alone in the living room.
...She hears voices.
Her body is broken and her head feels light, but she hears voices she doesn't want to hear.

"I don't know about you, but I've known you for quite a while."

She doesn't think about why she can hear the conversation.
But she doesn't want to hear them.
She wants to cover her ears if her arms would move, and she wants to go stop them if her legs would move.

"I was watching that. I was right by the school entrance. I was an idiot watching another idiot who kept trying to jump a height he couldn't clear."

"!"
She bites her lip.
She scratches the sheets with her fingers.
A past event, spoken of lightly.
The event that happened four years ago.
Her older sister speaks of it as if it's only her memory.
Like she's the only one who knows about it.
She's immersed in her beautiful memory, never even realizing that another girl was there.

"Stop. Stop. Please don't..."
"Don't take away my memory."
She strains her voice and makes a plea that none can hear.

The older sister's monologue continues.
It goes on without her, just as she feared.
The only thing.
The only thing she had an edge on over her older sister is brought down to mere recollections.

"NoNo, no, no...!"
Using magical energy to bridge the gaps in her ripped nerves, she covers her ears with her hands.
This is torture.
How can she know what's going on in the living room?
Has her shadow stretched that far?
No, she doesn't want to hear anything right now.
No more.
She will go crazy if she hears any more.

Knowing this instinctively, she covers her ears, but the voices do not get any quieter.
Her sister's voice resounds directly into her brain.
She cannot get away, even if she covers her ears or eyes.
And...

"Shirou. I'll kill her when the time comes. That's the best choice for both of us.
 You think about it too."

Her sister coldly says the words she does not want to hear
to the last person she wants to hear them.

And the voices stop.
She cannot tell what's going on in the living room anymore.
...It's only natural.
Her only world is this dark room.
There's no way for her to step into the world of light.


...Her eyes are hot.
She realizes that she's crying.
Heartbroken and frustrated.

Her older sister is a coward.
Why is she pushing that onto the girl's Senpai now?
It's her responsibility as Tohsaka's magus, but she's now trying to involve someone else.
Her sister is trying to turn her only ally against her.

"Nee-san..."
...She hates her.
She knows it's selfish, but she still hates her.
She's making him abandon Matou Sakura.
She hates Tohsaka Rin for trying to induce him.

"Nee-san."
...But it's strange.
This is what she wants, so why does she hate her so much?
Her sister is saying she should disappear.
The girl also knows she should disappear.
...She doesn't know how it's come to this, but she does know that Emiya Shirou will be saved if she disappears.

"......No, I don't want that."
She can't.
She doesn't want to lose anything.
She doesn't want to be alone anymore.
She learned of warmth, so going back to the cold is frightening.
She learned of warmth, so warm people are detestable.
...She will not disappear.
She will not be killed.
Because, because...

"Because nothing is my fault."

Right, everyone else is at fault.
She did not wish for such a thing.
It turned out this way because nobody helped her.
Nobody helped her, so that must mean they affirm her.
They didn't object. That's the same as agreeing with her.
...So.
No one can punish her.

"I won't die. It won't end up as Nee-san plans."
...No.
In reality, she will not die.
Nobody can kill her.
Even if someone still wants to try, that's fine.
If she is to be killed, she will rather .

Not only her older sister.
She will be merciless, even to her Senpai.
...Yes.
If he will turn away from her in disgust, then she would rather...
She would rather   like she does in her nightmare

"Ahhaa, ugh!"
She coughs violently.
The pain turns her wild imagination to blood, and she coughs it out.

"......No. I can't, Senpai."
They do not connect.
She cannot tell the difference between good and evil.
She cannot tell what's good.
She's about to lose her mind, not knowing who she is or how long she can stay sane.

"Hello. Are you still conscious of yourself, Sakura?"
Then.
Before she notices, the silver-haired girl is before her.
The same girl as her.
The white girl who is to become the container, who was not treated as a human being.

"Saber, Lancer, Caster, Berserker.
 It would've been fine with just these four. Where did you consume such a soul, Sakura? I'm surprised it's already sufficient when Assassin and Rider are still left."
...She doesn't understand.
She has heard from her grandfather that the girl is just like her, a container that collects the souls of the defeated Servants.
But she has not heard about any Servants being defeated other than the ones just mentioned...

"It's fine. I won't ask, since it means I don't have to worry about the Archer in me being taken away.
 But, Sakura. Do you know what's going to happen to you?"

...Her head cools down.
Her mind, delirious with fever, regains "Matou Sakura" with those words.

"I don't know. What will happen to me?"
The white girl shuts her mouth.
Einzbern's Master.
She was meant to be a vessel from the beginning, unlike the fake, Matou Sakura.
"You'll die. You can't be saved, no matter what."
And the girl tells her about the destiny that awaits them both.
I go to the living room.
"Huh? Did you come in from the entrance-side hallway?"
Ilya is sitting alone in the living room.

"Yeah. I was outside for a bit. Did anything happen while I was gone?"
"Nothing happened. But you have to stay in your room and rest, Shirou.
 Your body is as bad as Sakura's."

"Thanks. But I'm fine as long as the cloth is on."
"Geez, you'll easily faint if you're talking like

 Shirou. Did something happen outside?"

"No, not really."
"No way! I don't know what you went to do, but don't talk to me with such empty eyes!"

"Oh"
She scolded me.
...I see. I must've looked ridiculous.
It can't be helped if that's the case.

"I'm sorry. I know it does no good to worry, but I had to think."
I shake my head.
Like Ilya says, I can't empty my head.
I can't go see Sakura with a miserable face, so I have to show some spirit!

"Yeah, good. It seems you've cheered up.
 So, what do you want to ask about? I'll help you, if that's all right with you."


...Crap.
Ilya sometimes gets really kind.
This is the second time she's helped me when I'm feeling down.
I can't tell which of us is the older one.

"Okay. Can I ask you something, Ilya?"
"All right, I'll tell you anything. What do you want to know?"

"...The Holy Grail. Tell me about the Einzbern's Holy Grail."
"...I see, so you found out, huh? There were two things I didn't want you to find out, and that was one of them."

"Ilya. Then..."
"Yeah, I'm the Holy Grail. I'm not human. I'm a homunculus made that way."

Homunculus
An alchemical formula to create life without a womb, using sperm and other elements.
They are not born from a proper reproductive system, and therefore have physical defects.
Small bodies. Short lives. Lack of intelligence. Lack of reproductive functions.
They have human shapes and human lives, but they are not human, and therefore are completed with a powerful Magic Circuit.

They are weak as a life form.
But they far exceed human powers when they are made as magino, as Magic Circuits

"Well, so that's it.
 The Einzbern family raised me to function as both a Holy Grail and a Master.
 The function of the Holy Grail is to collect the souls of defeated heroic spirits. Humans, coffins, stew pot, it doesn't matter what it's made of as long as it has that special function. It just has to be a sufficiently large container of souls."

Ilya sounds like she's not interested.
Butthis is the first time I've heard that the Holy Grail collects Servants.

"Well, it's more like retrieving them than collecting them.
 Servants are summoned by the Holy Grail. Then it's natural that they return through the Holy Grail after they're defeated. I'm the only Holy Grail of Einzbern, so I should have collected all of them."

"...But it seems there's someone else that's functioning as a Holy Grail.
 It took Caster and Lancer when I noticed, and its drawing power was greater.
 So it took most of the Servants.
 ......I was able to collect Archer because he disappeared right in front of me."

...It doesn't even need to be said.
The other Holy Grail is Sakura.
According to Ilya, Sakura has already taken in Caster and Lancer... as well as Saber and Berserker.

"Four Servants' worth of souls. But can you hold such a thing?  Isn't it a general rule that the human body can only contain one soul?"

"Yes, all the more so if it's the soul of a heroic spirit.
 The magical energy of a Servant that lost its 'shell' called class is enormous. Having one in your body is like creating a typhoon in your body.
 But it's the function of the Holy Grail to collect seven in the end.
 There's no space for the soul of the container itself."

"That's why all the Holy Grails until now were inorganic substances without souls. The function of the Holy Grail is to collect the souls of all seven Servants, then to unify and manage them.
 You don't need extra programs in there. The personality of the Holy Grail will only be erased by the function of the Holy Grail."

"In short, Shirou. The Holy Grail loses its human functions the more complete it gets.
 The same goes for me. Once I collect many Servants, I have to cut off my functions as a human being to control the souls."

"I can manage them if I cut off the energy that moves my limbs.
 I won't let the souls out if I stop breathing.
 I can stabilize the integration of the souls if I use all the power I've used to construct my human form."

"That's the same for Sakura. You can't function as a human once you become a Holy Grail. You don't have the power to spare."

"......But, yes.
 If there is a difference between us, it's that I can switch at will, but Sakura is forced to. Sakura is an incomplete black Holy Grail, so she has no right to refuse."

Ilya shows no emotion as she continues.
...She knew it.
She probably knew it since the time she was born, no, even before she was born.
She knew that her life was made for such a stupid reason.


But there's something I can be glad about.
I place my hand on my tense chest and look up at the heavens, as if in thanks.

"What's wrong, Shirou? I said Sakura can't be saved."
I know.
I know that, but...

"You two are sharing them between you two, right? Then you're still..."
"Hm, yeah. Sakura took most of it, so there's no problem in me staying as myself. Rider and Assassin. Even if I collect their souls, I don't need to cut off my functions as a human being."

...Yes, that's fortunate.
If I lose Ilya as well, it will mean I can't protect anybody

"Eh, eh, Shirou...!?"
Before I know it, I'm embracing Ilya.
I can't promise her anything, and it's not like I want something.

"Shirou..."

Her body is small, so I can't hold her too tightly.
I just touch her, holding her in my arms.
I let my fingers feel the weight of what I must protect.
It's almost two o'clock.
It's late, but I decide to make lunch and take it to Sakura's room.

"Well."
I take off my apron and put the rice porridge on a tray.
I take a deep breath.
And I fill my heart with ice.

I don't know what I'll say if I go see Sakura in this condition.
I can't do that.
If Sakura figures out that I'm troubled, she'll just be even more troubled herself.

I have to freeze my emotions so that I don't reveal anything.
...This will the last time.
This will be the last time we will be together to just casually see each other's faces.
I want our precious time together to end in laughter.

"Are you awake, Sakura? It's late, but let's eat lunch."
I knock and enter her room.
It seems Sakura was sleeping, but her face brightens up as soon as I enter.
"Yes. I'm glad you came, Senpai."
She happily smiles.

Time passes.
Sakura is getting better.
She can sit up on her own, and she even ate the rice porridge without assistance.

Lunch ends and we talk about meaningless things.
Apparently sleepy after eating, Sakura continues to talk while lying in bed.
That's it.
That's all we can do right now.

Sakura seems well.
She's breathing normally, and her cheeks are red and healthy-looking.
I can believe that she won't last even a few more days.

"But I've rarely caught colds.
 I have a healthy body, and I've never had to stay in bed with a fever."

We started with how she dislikes cold medicine, and she's now telling me how healthy she was.
It seems she's never been seriously ill, and I hear she cured any cold symptoms with her spirit.

"Spirit? You mean you warmed yourself up and rested?
 ...No, that's not what spirit means. How can you have spirit during a cold?"
"Oh, um... it's an embarrassing story, so it's a secret."

Sakura laughs in embarrassment.
...Hm. It seems Sakura was an energetic child in her own way.

"So it's not that I dislike cold medicine, but it's that I can't trust it. Don't you get nervous because you can't tell the effect of the medicine?"

"Oh, I guess it was like that when I was a kid. I didn't get well even after I drank this bitter medicine, so I blamed the pain and the fever on it."

Sakura happily agrees.
...Seeing her smile makes me imagine that she's getting better and that she'll be up and well tomorrow.


...I silence my all too convenient wish.
Sakura won't get well.
I can't postpone my decision, believing that everything will turn out fine once she gets better.

"Hey, Sakura."
Maybe it's because I've accepted the cold reality.
"What do you want to do once you get better?"
I ask her about a what-if.
I ask her about a convenient future.

"Eh...? What I want to do...?"
"Yeah. Something that's fun for you. Anything's fine. I'm just asking, so don't worry about if it's possible or not."
"Ehhmm, hold on."
Sakura looks around, troubled.

After some pondering...
"I guess I don't have anything.
 I'm fine how things are right now, and just being with you is good enough."
Sakura blushes.


My vision narrows.
I have to keep my feelings frozen.

'She has never done anything for herself.'

Damn old bastard! It's not that she hasn't done anything...!
She just doesn't know how.
Fun things.
She doesn't know what she wants because she's never known a normal life.
She's never known normal happiness, so she values such trivial things

"...Senpai? Um, is something wrong...?"
"Huh? Oh, I was just thinking to myself."

She hasn't done anything yet.
Sakura doesn't know what she should have, what she should obtain.

Sakura doesn't smile outside.
Sakura doesn't make friends.
A closed world, consisting of my house and the Matou's.
But if I can change it, I'll pay any price

"S-Senpai...? Um, you're acting strange.
 ...Does your left hand hurt?"
"No, it's not that.
 Sakura. Let's go somewhere far away once this is all over.
 We've never gone anywhere for fun, right? It's good to go off and enjoy ourselves once in a while."


Sakura blankly stares at me.
It looks like she's surprised, like she thinks it's all a dream.

"It's decided. Where do you want to go, Sakura?"
"Ehum, where? Um"
She thinks in confusion.
She doesn't answer for a while.
But she must have found a wish she wants with all her heart.

"...Um. It can be anything, right?"
Sakura timidly looks up at me.

"Yeah. There's nowhere you can't go if you put your mind to it."
I'm serious, but it seems she took it as a joke.
Sakura smiles with relief.
"Then I want to go cherry blossom viewing."
And she makes a trivial wish.

"Cherry blossom viewing? You mean that cherry blossom viewing?"
"Yes. We can do it here, but there are only plum trees here. I want to go cherry blossom viewing in a big field on a sunny day."

"I see. That certainly..."
...Sounds really fun.
It'll be great to watch cherry blossoms under a clear blue sky at the park by the bridge.
There are many fun things.
Starting out with cherry blossom viewing suits Sakura.

"All right. Then it's a promise. Let's go there together once you get well and once this whole mess is over."
Sakura shows a satisfied smile.
I make the promise and stand up.

......Yes.
How great will it be if we can really do that?
I imagine my own happiness that I've never imagined since the fire ten years ago.

I leave her room.
All that's left is a trivial promise.
It's not just Sakura's wish.
This promise, which can be fulfilled come April, is my wish as well.


I dream of a warm fantasy with a frozen mind.

Once winter is over.
Once spring arrives, we'll go view the cherry blossoms together
The door closes.
The boy, who said he'd protect the girl as if trying to convince himself, left after making sure she fell asleep.

"............Haa."
The girl, Matou Sakura, painfully moans in the darkness.
She is not asleep.
She only pretended to be asleep so that the boy, who was more tired than her, can rest.

Andshe cannot afford to sleep anymore.
She'll see that dream if she sleeps.
She'll see something similar to her kill people.
It's frightening.
She doesn't remember what kind of dream she had last night.
She doesn't remember why she was unconscious outside.

Soit feels like she will never wake up again if she falls asleep tonight.
She will end up betraying the boy who held her close.
The boy threw away his self and believed in the weak and sly Matou Sakura.
His decision is still hurting her heart, so she will not be able to see him again if she turns out to be like the dream.

Yes.
She has destroyed his mind to the point that it cannot be fixed.
So she has to bear it.
She has to stay conscious, not sleep, and never see that dream again.
A person exists that will protect her.
Even if she may be dirty and cowardly, she has to maintain control with all her might while she still remains.

"I'm fine with that. But..."
...There's something that cannot be returned.
She has committed a crime that she cannot atone for with the life that remains to her.

    'I'll protect you.'

He repeated it, knowing there's no hope or future.
Recalling it makes her cry.
...Half an hour ago.
She was determined when he came to her room.
She knows that he came to kill her.
She's sensitive to the hostility of others. Even if someone comes to kill her in her sleep, she will notice.

...But the hostility was empty.
It's not that he's not feeling anything.
It was a painful emptiness, as if there was a big hole in his chest with cold wind blazing through it.
That made her accept death.
She thought the best possible outcome would be if the boy were the one to stop her.

"y."
But she was a coward, as she had known.
She was ready for death, but she could not stop trembling.
And...
She cornered him by saying something selfishly convenient.

"rry."
He embraced her.
The boy still embraced her.
They both knew there was no future.
But he still put his arms around her, knowing fully well what awaited them in the end.

The boy still had determination.
His embracing arms told her that he will accept the crime she committed and will commit.

"...rry, Senpai"
That's why it's sad.
He can do it.
She knew that from the start.
...The school in the sunset.
The person that kept on running.
The boy that changed her voice from "give up" to "keep going".

She has wished from that time.
To be with him.
To be protected by him.
Admiring him for no reason, she went to his house like her grandfather told her and made her wish come true.

'I'll protect you. I swore to be your superhero.'

"......!"
This is the result.
As his life goes on, he will only continue to break down.

"Sorry... I'm sorry, Senpai"
What she admired...
She finally understands why.
The boy was beautiful in her eyes.
He's different from her, who is a coward.
She wished for him to keep his upstanding character.

"But I"
...Yes, she remembers.
She wanted to protect him.
She wanted to protect the boy.
She wanted to protect the clumsy, but upright boy that she found in the setting sun.
"I broke it."

That's all she wished for.
So why...
Why did it turn out like this?

...And then.
The girl makes her final resolution.

"You're there, right, Rider?"
She calls out into the darkness.

The girl should be the only one here, but a woman appears like a ghost.
It is Matou Sakura's Servant, Rider.

"...I thought so. Were you guarding me?"
"Yes. Had he tried to take your life, I would have killed him."

...She sighs, thinking it was close.
Rider puts priority on her master.
Her decision is based solely on whether that person will kill her Master, Matou Sakura.
In that regard, Emiya Shirou was Rider's enemy back then.

"...Don't do anything to him, Rider. I won't forgive you if you hurt him."
"My role is to protect you. If he is to be your enemy, I must fulfill my mission. I will protect you, no matter what you may become."
"...Do you mean that, even if I turn into something other than myself?"

There's no reply.
It's something she shouldn't say, the worst possible scenario.
...Yes.
Even if Emiya Shirou sides with Matou Sakura.
If Matou Sakura recognizes Emiya Shirou as her enemy, he will become a foreign foe that must be defeated.

"............"
The girl raises her body and clenches her fists.
...Rider's statement hasn't angered her.
She's just scared that the assumption might become a reality.

"...Sakura?
 What are you doing? You cannot use magic with that body of yours!"
Ignoring Rider, the girl raises her hand in the darkness.

The magical energy runs through it for only an instant.
When the light fades, the only thing different is her left hand.
"Sakura."
"...This is my last Command Spell. Please, Rider. Please protect Senpai until the end, no matter what happens in the future."
The girl gives her final order.
The Command Spell is gone from Matou Sakura's hand.

"...I'll stop Grandfather.
 This is a problem between me and the Matou family. ...I know it's too late, but I can't cause any more trouble."
The girl holds her chest as she coughs.
...Her eyes light up in the darkness.
They are weak, but they are eyes of determination that belong to a magus.
I told you to stop with the scary stories!

Oh, you don't like scary stories, master?

No, I hate them. They might take my belly button, so I'm gonna go home.

Hey, you can't do that, Taiga. You're the master, so you have to teach.
What will you do if a challenger comes to this dojo?

They won't come. I've been in this dojo for ten years, but such a person never came.
So I'm gonna go home. I have a bad feeling.

Why speak with a Kansai dialect...?
Huh? Master, there's a challenger.

All right, send him home.

Why!? You'd usually say something like...

'All right! I never thought I'd see a challenger while I was alive!'
 And jump around with joy like a junkie!

I'm saying I have a bad feeling.
First of all, I have a bad feeling from the

 name of this dead end...

...Sac... rifice......

IT'S HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!
NO, I CAN'T STAND MYSTERIOUS THINGS LIKE THIS!!!

Oh, I know this. This is called mixed martial arts, right?

All right, do your best, Tiger!

I can't!

Here, your opponent is that buruma girl. Her moe power is ten times stronger than mine. You should be fully satisfied.

...Eat... the hakama...

Whoa, go away, evil spirit!
Someone go get sec*m!

Starting now is the match, Taiga VS the black shadow!
It seems the black shadow is dominating, but Taiga is turning defiant.

Oh she bit it! Taiga is being swallowed, but is trying to swallow it back!

She's fighting it...!
Master can match it...!

Guaaa! God of Babylonia, give me your powers!

Well, I don't really care.
You'll just end up losing even if you fight that thing, so don't even think about it, okay, Shirou?

What you have to do is to figure out what the shadow is.

No pain, no gain.
Go back to the previous choice and go with Assassin's invitation.

Noooo, I can't! I'm tapping! Hey, referee, I'm tapping out!

Bye!
I'll be the master in the next Tiger Dojo if everything goes well!
"H-He's dead...!"
The impossible has occurred.
The door was locked from the inside when Fujimura-san went into the room.
The only ones in the room are me, Fujimura-san, and Lady Ilya.

"But how...!? There's no one in this room other than us!"
"There are two ways.
 One is an accident with lack of affection points.
 The victim had a low Sakura-chan affection score, so he mistook the ornamental guillotine for the bed, and he went to sleep."

"I see. It seems very unlikely, but it's certainly possible.
 That kind of taste is expected from Sakura."
I see.
Sakura's taste sure is troublesome.
So the bed turned into a guillotine the instant someone got on it!

"Yes. So the solution would be to start over from day 9 and increase Sakura-chan's affection points.
 The other method is a direct offense brought on by an external factor.
 The victim was also the assailant.
 He tried to kill Sakura-chan here. But he was killed instead because the knife-throwing security system was set off"

"Mississippi system, huh? Setting such a scary trap... Sakura is a scary girl...!"

Their speculation heats up.
But I think of another method that doesn't fall under either scenario.
It goes like this.
Going back to yesterday morning.
What if my death was determined the instant I said "no" to Tohsaka-san's question...?
"Anyway, the case is solved.
 Let's go, Lady Ilyasviel. We can leave the rest to the police and get away from this haunted mansion."
"......Okay. But this case left a bad aftertaste."

The actors leave.
The only one left on the stage is me, the corpse.
The conclusion is...
I wish they'd never again do a one-time ridiculous Tiger Dojo that has no logical solution.

I wake up up at the same time as usual.
It's before six o'clock.
The day is dawning, and the sky is filled with gray clouds again.

I don't feel any pain from my left arm.

There's no one in the living room.
I should make breakfast before Tohsaka wakes up.

The news is on.
It's becoming my daily routine to check the news in the morning.

"There aren't any big stories. I guess it didn't appear last night."
She must mean the black shadow.
"Yeah. I guess it doesn't come out every day."
I answer, careful not to let my relief show.

"Yeah. I wouldn't be able to bear hundreds of people getting hurt two days in a row."

It's past seven.
Tohsaka and I are the only ones in the living room.
Sakura and Ilya are both sleeping.
I wanted Ilya to wake up and come, but Tohsaka told me that she's tired and I should let her rest.

"So you should rest too, in preparation for tonight."
Tohsaka says this out of the blue.
"...Why?"

"It's the creation of our secret weapon. We'll complete the framework today, so we'll do the projection tonight.
 We'll go settle our match with Zouken as soon as we succeed. We can't allow any more victims. No matter what that shadow may be, the Holy Grail War will end once we defeat Zouken. The mysterious shadow should disappear then."

"Tohsaka. You really think the shadow will disappear once the war is over?"

"It will.  Whatever it is, I'm sure it appeared because of the Holy Grail.
 I don't know if it wants the Holy Grail, or if the Holy Grail summoned it. But either way, it's here because of the Holy Grail, so it'll disappear once the Holy Grail is gone.
 In short, the shadow will disappear once the war ends.
 That will happen when the time limit expires, when only one Master remains, orwhen the Holy Grail's vessel dies."

"Tohsaka, you"
...Already...
Knew what that shadow is?

"I'm just guessing.
 It might not disappear even if we defeat Zouken.
 It might not disappear even when the war ends.
 So I'm going to take the surest method. We can't rely on uncertainties like obtaining the Holy Grail ourselves. We have to take down both Zouken and the shadow with our own powers."

Tohsaka gets up.
I don't know why, but she takes the water jug and pajamas I prepared for Sakura.

"Hey, what are you doing?"
"I'll go see how Sakura's doing. Her room is next to mine, so I'm in a better position to look after her."
"Heyno, I'll take care of Sakura."

"Don't be stupid. You didn't get any sleep last night, did you? Can't you tell that you'll be a liability in your condition?"
...?
I didn't get any sleep?

"Don't be stupid. I slept last night."
"I don't believe this. You're so tired that you don't even notice it?
 ...Geez, go look at the mirror if you think I'm lying. If you went to nurse Sakura with dark circles around your eyes and looking pale, it'd just make her worried."
"Whatare you serious?"

"Why would I lie? Geez, just go to your room and rest. I'll go get you in the afternoon.
 Oh, and if you can't go to sleep, I can help you. If you don't mind me copying Rider, I can put you under for about a day."

Copying Rider means copying her mystic eyes. But as far as I know, Tohsaka doesn't have mystic eyes.
In short, she's...

"Are you telling me to be your guinea pig?"
"Exactly. I wasn't interested before, but mystic eyes might not be that bad. I can't do anything on that scale, but I might be able to do something like sleep suggestion."

"Don't lie. What was that about them not being bad?
 You just don't want to stay defeated, so you want to learn it too, right?"

"J-Just be quiet! So, what about it?
 Do you want to try it or not?"
"No, you idiot! I'm having nothing to do with such a dangerous experiment. First of all, if I sleep for a day, I can't wake up until tomorrow morning."

"Oh, right. It'll be paralysis instead of sleep if it works too well. I think it'll work well on you since you're simple-minded."
Tohsaka seems to be convinced.
I want to object, but I stay quiet since she might test it on me if I do object.

"Well, I'm not that sensitive, so I can sleep if I want. You don't have to worry about me."
"Really? Then can you rest in your room and let me handle Sakura's care?"
...Then.
Tohsaka drops her joking manner and asks me with serious eyes.


I can't answer right away.
...I want to be with Sakura.
But I have other things to do, and I can't let Sakura see me if I look as terrible as Tohsaka says.
I can trust Tohsaka with Sakura's care, so I'll take her offer.

"...You're right. Then I'll be in my room.
 I'll bring her lunch and dinner, so can you take care of her the rest of the time?"
"Yeah, you can leave her to me. I'll scold her and put her back in bed if she tries to get up.
 So, can you really sleep by yourself? Don't you want to try it out once?"

"You're persistent. I don't want anything dangerous.
 But thanks, Tohsaka. I'm sorry for making you look out for me."
"I-I'm not looking out for you. I-I'm going, so you go sleep, okay!?"

Tohsaka leaves in a hurry.
...Man.
I don't know if she's perceptive or not, nor if she's a good person or a cold person.
I hear geniuses tend to leave everyone else behind them, and I'm guessing that's Tohsaka's type.
Sakura has it tough. I'd never have peace of mind if Tohsaka were my older sister.

"Well, I bet every day would be fun, though."
...Right.
That's why I want them back to being sisters as quickly as possible.

Sakura and Tohsaka can be together again once the war ends, and the promise between their families goes away.
The eleven-year gap won't be bridged that easily, but I want them to get close enough to laugh together over trivial matters.

I'll do anything to help.
I think this is the most I can do for Sakura.

"Oh, and for Tohsaka too. Sakura is like the only one who can make her look troubled."
Oh, crap.
I just imagined Tohsaka smiling happily.
I'm sorry, Sakura. Wait, does this count as being unfaithful?

"No, more importantly..."
I can't take it easy forever.
Tohsaka said she'll challenge Zouken tonight.
...That's bad.
The war will end if we defeat Zouken.
The Holy Grail will appear once the war ends.
No, rather, the Holy Grail will be opened.

Zouken said the Holy Grail is a gate.
What grants the wishes is not the Holy Grail, but what's inside of it.
...If that's true, what will happen to Sakura, who is the Holy Grail?
Ilya said that...
Sakura loses her human functions as she nears completion as a Holy Grail.

"!"
...So there's only one way to save Sakura.
Protect her until the Holy Grail War ends.
I don't know how the Holy Grail will appear.
I don't know if it appears when there's only one Master left, or if the last Master summons it.

...There's no problem if it's the latter.
I just have to defeat Zouken, eliminate what's threatening Sakura, and wait for the duration of the war.

Tohsaka said we'll challenge Zouken tonight.
Then we can beat Zouken.
If she says we're fighting, that means we have a high chance of winning.

"...Then there's only one problem."
...The black shadow.
Beating Zouken won't make it disappear.
It will continue to surface as long as the Holy Grail, Sakura, exists.
And it will take many lives every time.
Waiting for the deadline means doing nothing about that shadow.

"...I have to defeat it. I have to defeat the shadow myself."
...That's the only possible choice.
But can I beat it?
If that thing came from the Holy Grail, the shadow should not have a concept of death.
If I'm to eliminate it, I have to eliminate the projector, Sakura herself, or destroy the main body that's sending magical energy to the projector.

"...Main body, huh...?"
...I don't think such a thing exists.
But I can't come up with any effective plans unless I assume so.

"The content of the Holy Grail.
 Zouken implanted within Sakura a piece of the Holy Grail that was shattered in the previous war. Did it contain anything back then?"
Oh.
Wait a minute.
Zouken said he made the crest worm from a piece of the Holy Grail

"Kotomine. He didn't notice that...!?"
No way...!
He extracted some crest worm from Sakura.
He removed just a small quantity, but he treated Sakura's body.

There's no way he wouldn't notice.
He's the supervisor of the Holy Grail War, and he was one of the last surviving Masters in the previous war.
Then he should know what's wrong with her body...!

"Haa!"
I run out the door.
Compelled by the sudden insight, I can only think about the priest.

"Damn, why didn't I realize earlier...!?"
If I'd just thought about it, I would've seen it right away.
The shadow that appears as Sakura's subconscious form.
That man should know what's inside the Holy Grail!
"What?"
The first thing I feel after returning home is an icy chill.
Nothing's wrong, and there's no sign of danger.
But I have a bad feeling.

There's nobody in the living room.
Ilya is sleeping in her room.
Tohsaka is preparing for the projection in her room.
Sakura is

"I'm coming in, Sakura."
I call out and place my hand on the doorknob.
I feel a cold sensation on my back.
I shake off my uneasiness and open the door.

"Sakura."
"......!"
I see Rider for a second, but her figure disappears.
Behind her...
The bed which Sakura should be in is empty.

"!"
The light turns on.
"Wha"
I look around in surprise.
"Welcome back. I won't ask where you were, but you certainly took your time."

"Tohsaka...? What is this?"
"Isn't it obvious? Sakura went out by herself, and Rider has been glaring at me until now.
 ...I guess she's under orders not to hurt you. She switched to spirit form and ran out as soon as you came in."

"Wha"
Tohsaka sounds calm.
...No, that's not it.
Her voice doesn't sound calm.
Her tone is one of cold disinterest, as if she's given up on something.

"Tohsaka. Sakura really went out...?"
"It's true. She was gone before you left, so it's already been two hours.
 I don't know what her intentions are, but I guess she doesn't want to follow our directions. She had Rider stop me from going after her, so she must not want us to know what she's doing."

"Don't be stupid...! Sakura wouldn't hide things... from... us"
I can't say for certain.
...Sakura's nightmare.
I have no idea what Sakura thought about her deteriorating body.

"We have to bring her back...! If we leave her alone, it'll..."
"There may be victims. She might drain magical energy from anyone she sees, like when she attacked me at school.
 No one was attacked by the shadow last night, right? So she must be hungry."

"Tohsaka."
Tohsaka looks away and swallows her words.
Her eyes say to give up, telling me it's all over.

"Tohsaka, you..."
"We can look for Sakura. I agree with that.
 Butonce we find her... You know what to do if Sakura isn't herself anymore, right?"

"That's not possible. Sakura will always be Sakura."
"Are you insane? Can't you tell she's at her limit? Give up already, Shirou. If you keep protecting her, you'll be the first one to die"

"We can make stupid speculations later. We need to find Sakura and bring her home right now. After that I'll argue with you as long as you like, so shut up for now...!"
"Hey, wait, Shirou!"

I run through the hallway.
I don't have time to wonder where Sakura went.
'It's over now, Shirou.'

I run outside at full speed, as if denying her words.

"Shirou. Are you going to go look for Sakura?"

Then.
Someone unexpected calls to me from behind.

...When did she come here?
Ilya is watching me from a distance, as if there's a wall between us.

"...Ilya."
"Tell me, Shirou. Are you going to go look for Sakura?"

I nod.
Ilya's voice is tense.
The despair in her voice is different from Tohsaka's. As a Holy Grail, Ilya must understand what condition Sakura is in.

"I see. But Shirou, Sakura went outside by herself because she didn't want you to see her. She's scared and doesn't want to die, but she still chose to end herself in order to protect you.
 The Sakura you like doesn't exist anymore. She went out by herself to eliminate herself."


Ilya looks straight at me.
I meet her gaze and shake my head.
I won't let that happen.
Even if Sakura isn't Sakura anymore, there's only one thing I'm going to do.

"......I see. But Shirou. Both Sakura and I have another self in us. It's probably not the Ilya you know, and it's not the Sakura you know.
 Sakura won't come back. She'll just be a different person after she changes.
 But you still refuse to kill her?"

A quiet question.
This is what Ilya really means.
The Holy Grail is made with the premise of it breaking down.
So I don't need to hesitate about destroying it.
But to me, it sounds like she's talking about herself rather than about Sakura.

"Shirou. Let me ask you one more time.
 Are you still going to go look for Sakura?"
"........."
I don't know how much emotion her question carries.
So I honestly tell her the path I chose.

"Yes, I'm going to go look for her. Sakura will always be Sakura to me. The same goes for you. Even if you turn into a mysterious thing like a Holy Grail, you'll still be Ilya."

"...No matter how much you may have changed.
 If Ilya is inside you, you'll be the Ilya I know."


"I don't know about difficult things. That's all I care about."

I put my hand on the door.
"...It's Zouken's place. That's the only place Sakura would go to."
I hear her behind me.
"All right. Please wait here, Ilya. I'll go find Sakura and bring her back right away."

I leave.
Ilya stays standing in the hallway, as if seeing off something very far away.

I reach the Matou household.
I'm not out of breath.
My body has to be tired from all the running, but it doesn't complain to me at all.

"...It's open."
I stop before I ring the doorbell.
...Did someone go in or come out?
The front door is half open, and it's dead quiet inside.

I don't feel any human presence.
The Matou household is gloomier than yesterday.

There's nobody on the first floor.
My footsteps echo through the hallway.
The floor creaks as I make my way to the stairs.

There's nobody on the second floor.
I see the sky through the glass above the landing.
Once I make my way to the top, I'm able to tell that there's no living person on the second floor.

I turn to go back downstairs, but I stop.
A living person.
The strange feeling makes me head to the room with a slightly-opened door.

It's Sakura's room.
I've seen it once before.
But I've never actually gone in there before.
It's because Sakura pushed us out with a red face when Shinji led me here.

I think that was two years ago.
Nothing's changed.
A girl's room. It's a simple room suited for Sakura.
And on the bed...
"Shinji."
...Is the corpse of Matou Shinji.
"...Huh? Is that Shirou that just went outside...?"
Tohsaka Rin wonders about the sound from the front door.
She looks out the window and, sure enough, sees him running down the hill.

"That idiot...! I told him to rest, but he never listens to people...!"
She stops filling prescriptions and gets up.
Sakura's medicine is important, but stopping Shirou comes first.

"Man, warnings go in one ear and out the other for him...! He doesn't even realize how exhausted he is...!"
She dashes down the stairs.
She hurries to the entrance to quickly follow after Shirou.

"Oh, before that."
She has to check on Sakura, just in case.
She hasn't given her the water jug or the pajamas, since she was planning to bring them with the medicine. She hasn't taken her temperature either.
Shirou's recklessness angers her, but she can't scold Shirou if she ignores Sakura.

"Well, it seems like she's sleeping."
It's only been a minute.
Shirou should quickly lose his breath, stop, and rest at the bottom of the hill. He shouldn't even be able to run a kilometer in his condition.

"...The worst part is that he doesn't realize it."
If she runs, she can catch up with him in no time.
Of the people in the house right now, she has the most energy.
It's natural that the strongest one looks after the weaker members.

"I'm coming in, Sakura."
She goes in without waiting for a reply.
"I'm going outside. It won't be long, so keep resting. I'll leave your change of clothes here, so
She stops her sentence.
And....
"Crap. You did it, Sakura."
Rin punches the wall hard enough to break it.

Matou Sakura isn't in the room.
The one in bed is not her.

"...You've fallen far, Rider. I never thought I'd see a Servant sleep in a bed, pretending to be her Master."
"I was unwilling, but this is an order.
 But this is your carelessness. Please do not push your responsibility onto me."
"...Well said. She's the one causing us the trouble."
She grits her teeth.
Rin glares at Rider with hostility, and Rider ignores it coolly.

"Tohsaka Rin. If there is a next time, set a better observer. You cannot deceive Sakura with a mere jade bird familiar. She does not match you in ability, but her instincts are as good as yours."
"I see, thanks for the advice. ...But I guess that's not all, huh?"

"Of course not. Sakura instructed me not to let you out of the house until she returns."

Rin clucks her tongue.
She can't do anything now.
By herself, she cannot defeat or escape from Rider.
She can only stay here, just as Sakura planned.

"I'm really pissed. He tried to help her since she can't handle it by herself, but now she's gone alone to settle things?"
"Are you not going to resist? It is good to be graceful, but this is unexpected."
"I just don't have to go outside, right? I can't match you, so I'll stay quiet until she comes home."
She sighs and leans against the wall.

There's no will to fight.
Rin relaxes, looks down, and...
"But Rider. She won't come back. ...No. Even if she does come back, she won't be the Matou Sakura we know."
...Mentions the worst-possible future with the cold voice of a magus.
"Shinji."
Shinji's corpse is on the bed.
There's nothing else.
What happened here?
There's no way I would know, but...
"Sakura."
...Somehow, I can tell that Sakura killed him.

"............"
I can't think.
Shinji's corpse.
Sakura's whereabouts.
It's only been half a day since I embraced Sakura, so how did it end up like this?

"Oh. So it is the Emiya boy.
 I would like to commend you for coming here, but it seems you were a bit too late."

"!"
I turn around at the sudden voice.

"......!"
There's no one behind me.
I know there's nobody in this house.
Zouken's voice is echoing through the room even though he's not here.

"Zouken...! What did you do to Sakura...!?"

"I did nothing. As you can see, my unworthy grandson tried to violate her and was killed instead. It's nothing to make a fuss over.
 Butthis will be the last time I call him an unworthy grandson.
 He was useless, but he fulfilled his role in the end."

He laughs.
I can't see the old magus, but I'm sure he's laughing with a hideous face.

"Shinji's role...?"
"Yes. I cannot make her put her mind to it. She hates me too much. So I had to have you or Shinji break her down.
 I needed Sakura to feel despair in this world to have her accept her own shadow."

"Wha"
"Oh, my. It was my mistake. I took her emotional strength too lightly. I expected her to break easily, but she would never do so on her own.
 It seems torturing her for a long time had its flaw. I did not expect her to become so persistent."

"You"
My nerves condense.
Before I even understand what he's saying, I clench my right fist, open my Magic Circuit, and...

"Well, if I am to be greedy, I wanted you to betray her. She would not have awakened incompletely, but her body and mind would have completely turned into the shadow in that case!
 But that is only a matter of time.
 With Shinji's death, she has finally accepted her position. I need only watch over her now. She will follow her instincts to feed on people, and destroy herself from overeating.
 My work comes after th"

I punch the wall.
With all my might, I lash out at the darkness where the voice is coming from.
I unconsciously fill my hand with magical energy, which is transmitted into the wall and sweeps the darkness from the room.

"My, how frightening. The worms I left to keep watch over this place have been crushed. Haha, soon my voice will no longer reach you."
"Shut up and get out here, Zouken...! I'll rip you to pieces...!"

"Well, I am afraid I cannot do that. The goal the Makiri have sought for five hundred years is within my grasp.
 I cannot be killed now, yet I'm not so ungrateful as to kill you."

"Ungrateful...? Shut up!  When did I do anything for you...!?"

"You did. You raised Sakura. Before, she merely endured, but you taught her how to desire others.
 Yes, I appreciate what you did, Emiya Shirou. This ritual was a success because of you.
 That is why I will not kill you. I need you to see her after she matures...!"

"Zou... ken."
"Kaka, nobody can stop her now. She has killed her brother, so she cannot turn back.
 She will take in Archer's soul from Einzbern's Holy Grail and steal the key to reach the gate.
 That will be the end. Makiri's earnest desire, the reproduction of the Third Sorcery, will be achieved...!"

The annoying laugh echoes through the room.
I

Hold on.
Steal Einzbern's Holy Grail...?
"!"

I run.
I don't care about the laughter.
I'm sure he's watching me from a safe place.
There's no time to let an old man's drivel get to me

"That's right. Hurry, Emiya Shirou!
 Sakura has turned dark. Once she captures Ilyasviel, she will swallow her without mercy...!"
"!"

I kick the ground hard enough to tear my legs off.
"Please be all right, Ilya!"
It'll take twenty minutes to get to my house, even if I run full-speed.
I glare at the gray sky and run frantically back to Ilya.
"Zouken......!!!!"
I'll settle it now.
Zouken should be somewhere in this house. I'll find him and kill him...!

"Damn it, where are you, you old bastard...!?"
I can't find him anywhere in the house.
His presence is fading by the second.
"Oh, my. You must be blinded by your anger.
 I thought you would be smarter."

Even his laughing voice is fading away.

"HaaHaa, haa, ha"
...Zouken's not here.
He wasn't in this house to begin with.
He's a worm user. The only ones here are his worms...!

"Are you satisfied now? Then go home, Emiya Shirou.
 Sakura will soon swallow Ilyasviel. If you do not hurry, you will not be there for the birth of the monster you raised."
"You old bastard...!"

I kick the ground hard enough to rip my legs off.
Giving in to my anger wasted too much time.
It'll take twenty minutes to get to my house, even if I run full-speed.
Will I make it?
I have to head back to my house before Sakura finds Ilya!
The girl is looking up at the sky.
The gray sunlight dulls her silver hair and red eyes.
"...Yeah. I have to tell Shirou once he comes home."
Ilyasviel talks to herself.

The Emiya household is quiet.
Shirou and Rin went to find Sakura.
Rider, naturally, is nowhere to be seen, leaving Ilya as the only one here.
"The giant cavern. The promised land built two hundred years ago. From the feel of it, it's already activated."
This is the fifth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki.
The Holy Grail has been summoned into different places each time, but it has returned to the original site for this war.

It's only natural.
They use one of the gates located at the four compass points, and move on to the next when one fails.
The first was the Ryudou Temple.
The second was the Tohsaka household.
The third was the church on top of the hill.
The fourth was that burned field.
Then this summoning returns to the site of the first.
The point of origin.
The false utopia that sets the rules of the Holy Grail War.

"A Holy Grail filled with the souls of heroic spirits.
 Using it to open the gate is the very miracle they aimed for... But I didn't expect its contents to come out before the gate had been opened."
Ilya murmurs in disbelief.
This is far away from the Einzbern's dearest wish.
They have failed.
The disaster that will be born is a far cry from what they wished for.

"...I can just leave it be. My role is to open it. Nobody told me anything about closing it."
And she couldn't possibly close it, even if she tried.
Matou Sakura excels her in ability as the Holy Grail.
Einzbern's Holy Grail cannot do anything to the gate opened by Makiri's Holy Grail.
Matou Zouken thinks he opened the same gate, but in reality, he opened a completely different one.
The only ones aware of this are the Holy Grails: the girl and Matou Sakura.

"Will Shirou make it? I could run away with him if he does."
She looks up at the sky.
The girl is wavering.
She doesn't know whether to choose the role imposed on her or the desire born from within her.

"But Shirou. It makes no difference to the fact that I'm going to die."
The result is the same.
Regardless of whether she goes to the gate as the Holy Grail or runs away, she will die.
Which is her true self?  She asks the gray sky for an answer.



That's why she doesn't notice.
The person who came through the door with an "I'm home."
Did she slip through the boundary field, or did it not consider her a trespasser?



Slowly.
She moves from the living room to the yard without a sound, then reaches out to the girl sitting at the porch.
"You're home late, Sakura. Where were you?"

"Nee-san..."
The trespasser, Matou Sakura, stops her hand.
She looks away from Ilya and to Tohsaka Rin, who has been waiting for her in the yard.

"Get away from Ilya. I'll shoot you down if you get any closer to her."
Everyone here knows it's no empty threat.
"It's useless. Well, go ahead if it'll satisfy you, Rin."
Ilyasviel starts walking without showing any surprise.
The girl walks to the edge of the yard, as if to watch over the two's confrontation.

"...I see. You were waiting here all along, Nee-san. You knew I was coming for Ilya-chan."
"Yeah. I don't have a reason to save you, unlike Shirou. It was obvious that you'd come to kidnap Ilya when the time came. You've done it once before, so I'd be foolish not to keep an eye on her."

Sakura's brows twitch at Shirou's name.
Showing unhappiness.
She shows undisguised hatred that would surprise anyone who knew her previous self.

"...That's terrible. You're always like that, Nee-san. You always make fun of me. You're beautiful, so you look down on me because I'm dirty.
 You're absolutely hateful. Nee-san. Am I that bad of a person?"
Her voice contains no emotion.
The question alone should send a chill up anyone's spine.

"Of course. You're a big idiot who gave up her chance to be saved the instant she stepped out of this house. You didn't trust the person that Matou Sakura wanted to protect."
But Tohsaka Rin gives a firm reply.

"Oh"
Sakura looks down.
As if acknowledging the truth of her mistake.

"But I..."
"Don't say you thought it was for the best. We told you not to go outside. If you had any objections, you should've come and talked with us first.
 But you went without saying anything. You went alone and made the same mistake you always made.
 Unbelievable. People take advantage of you because you can't do something as simple as that."

"...You're right. I was definitely like that until now.
 But Nee-san. I'm not weak anymore. You're the one who can stay in the house now. I'll protect Senpai."
Her cold stare, the emitting ominous shadow...

Realizing that it's as she feared, Rin takes a step back.

Not knowing...
That her hesitation is the last trigger that drives Matou Sakura.

"...What's wrong, Nee-san? Curling your back like that makes it look like you're scared of me."

It's too late when she clucks her tongue.
......No.
It's not too late or anything.
When Sakura reached for Ilyasviel, it was already too late.

"......I see. So you don't intend to stay quietly in your room anymore?"
"No. I don't need to listen to what you say anymore."

"Because I'm stronger."

The shadow dances.
Many shades of darkness emerge from the ground below Sakura and engulf the yard.
And from the shadow...
"Sakura, you"
...Emerges a swordsman who is contaminated in black.

"Saber, capture the Holy Grail. If she tries to resist, go as rough as you like."

Black Saber obeys without a word.
...There's no doubt about it.
What that shadow is.
Tohsaka Rin bites her lip, seeing what kind of fate awaits a Servant swallowed by the mud.

At that instant.
"!"
"Hah!"
A merciless attack.
A shadow with magical energy far surpassing that of Tohsaka Rin is fired.

"......!"
She rolls as she lands.
The fired shadow is on the same level as the black shadow.
It'll be the end if it touches her.
If it even grazes her, it will stick to her skin, covering her in an instant.
And after that.
If Tohsaka Rin is swallowed by the mud that even a Servant cannot escape, she will be absorbed without hope of resistance.

"Damn......!"
The black tentacles whip towards her in rapid succession.
Rin realizes that the attacks are not from the black shadow, but a magic Sakura possesses.
That magic of Matou is to bind others.
But Sakura is originally from the Tohsaka familya shadow-user with an origin of the imaginary element, the imaginary number.
Matou Sakura is able to embody the black shadow to that degree because she has both of those attributes!

"......!!!!"
She's easily cornered.
Their magical energy capacities are too unevenly matched.
Sakura's magical energy is infinite.
Her capacity reaches a hundred million.
To Rin, whose capacity is a mere three hundred, Sakura is a monster.

She controls both the black shadow and Saber, who has the greatest magical energy out of all the Servants.
...Even a Servant will not be able to match such a monstrous magus.

".........This is bad. Her magic's simple, but our energy capacity is too different"
She stares at what Sakura has become, gasping for breath.
...She has no chance of winning, and she cannot escape.
It'd be a different story if she had a source of magical energy like the Holy Grail, but she doesn't have such a thing.

"...Well, no magical energy source in the world can match the Holy Grail."
She suppresses her frustration by grumbling.
"Oh, you can't do that, Nee-san. It's dangerous if you stop there."
Sakura points her hand at Rin without hesitation.

There's no mercy.
Sakura smiles, enjoying the absolute dominance.
"Nowlet's play more, Nee-san.
 I know you'll be caught in the end, but please keep running until then."
She smiles at her beloved sister.

The result is as obvious as she says.
Rin cannot get away from the shadow.
Sakura can quickly cover the whole house with the shadow if she wishes.
As Sakura slowly expands the extent of the shadow, Rin is defeated without being able to do anything.

"Ah, ah............"
The black shadow covers Tohsaka Rin.
The gel-like mud tightly binds Rin's body, turning into numerous tongues to invade her Magic Circuit.

"Oh, is that all?  You're not as strong as I thought, Nee-san."
She looks down at her helpless sister.
Wild breathing and heated cheeks.
Her older sister is covered with heavy oil, exciting even Sakura, who is of the same sex.

"Sa... kura"
Her face is left uncovered, perhaps because Sakura wants to enjoy her pain.
"You........."
Rin swallows her contempt and glares back at Sakura.
But that's only for a few seconds.
The mud that stirs her body violates her internal organs.

"Kuh...! Ahh, haa........."
"Fufu. Then I'll be having you now. I was looking forward to this. This will be the first time I've eaten magical energy from a magus."
The gel-like shadow tightens around Tohsaka Rin.
The "meal" doesn't even last a second.

"Ah...... Hm"
"......It's good. I'm not full at all, but it helps a bit."
The last traces of magic fade from Tohsaka Rin.
That's the end.
Head down and chest heaving, Rin has no power to resist.
She has no way to fight back, but

"That won't do. I have to kill her here, or I..."
Will lose to Nee-san.
...It's a groundless assumption.
The difference in their powers will never be overturned.
But Sakura is firmly convinced that she will lose if they fight again.

So she has to kill her here.
Taking her magical energy and leaving her powerless isn't enough.
She has to kill Rin here, just as Rin tried to do to her.
She tries to convince herself as she opens her palms.

"Nee-san, you"
The shadow doesn't extend.
She trembles, gaze focused on her weakened sister, and...
"Sakura!!!!!!"
The person she least wants to see catches up to her.
Ahhaa, haa ha

My chest hurts.
My heart has been sending me a danger signal for a while now.
Thump, thump, splat, thump.
The heart spits out blood to the rest of the body, raging around as though saying it'll  if it moves anymore.

Ahhaa, haa, ha

My throat hurts.
It feels like I'm swallowing needles every time I take a breath.
So it's too scary to breathe.
I'm already oxygen-deprived, so intentionally limiting my breathing is like suicide.

Ahhaa, haa ha

My limbs don't move well because they lack oxygen.
I made it this far with unsteady steps, but I might fall unconscious at any time.

Fuh, kuh...!

That thought brings back my strength.
I can't fall here.
Sneaking out would become meaningless.
I need to settle my match.
I have to stop the old man that made me a Master, even if it costs me my life.

HaaHaa, ha

...I steady my breathing.
It's fine, it's not hard.
It might be hard for others, but it's no problem for me.
I just have to look at him, like I do every night at dinner, and shake my head.
Andthat old man's scheme will end.

...I don't think about what'll happen to me after I disobey the monster.
If I do, I won't be able to go through with it.
So I stop thinking too much.
Fortunately, the memory in my head is vague.
I won't remember what I'm doing now in the next instant, so the fear is relatively small.

I walk through my house, which I haven't been in for a few days.
A dark house.
I look through my scattering memory, but can't remember the house ever being bright.
It's just like always.
It's damp, degenerate, and viscous like always.

But

"No waywhy?"

But it's not as expected.
Grandfather's presence is not in the house.
The worms' presence cannot be felt anywhere.

"...Haaah, ahh..."
I hold myself upright and look around the empty living room.
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.
That old man is not in the house.
His laughing voice is not in the basement.

"...No way... Why?"
It doesn't make sense.
GrandfatherMatou Zouken wants me back.
But he couldn't do anything until now because I was at the Emiya household.
So now should be his best chance.
He will definitely come and try to turn me into a Holy Grail if I'm alone.
So why isn't he coming out?

"Ah... haa... haa... ah"
...My consciousness is fading away.
...That's bad.
I have to see Matou Zouken before I fall asleep, before Senpai goes into action.
I have to see him and end it right now.
It'll all be over once I see him, so why isn't he appearing today of all days!?

"...He should know...!"
Right, there's no way he doesn't know.
He's always watching me. He can find me, no matter where I hide or how far I run.
He knows he can easily catch and control me.
...He never considers the possibility that I might resist.
He only treats me as a tool.

"......So... why?"
There's no way he doesn't know.
It shouldn't even matter that the priest removed some of my crest worm.
...Because that's just insurance.
He's watching my actions using a more reliable method.
He knows my current condition. He's even listening to my heartbeat.
He knows I'm alone here and that I left Rider behind.
Because he's

"Sakura."
A voice comes from right behind me.
And...
"...Nii-san?"
Right when I realize it's Nii-san and turn around...
I don't stop until I reach the church.
I was breathing hard when I was running down the hill, but my fatigue went away by the time I got to the intersection.

"HaaHaa, haa."
Even I'm surprised by how well I'm doing.
Even though I took the shortest route, I ran full speed for five kilometers from my house to the church.

"Wait, this is no time to be amazed at myself."
I head to the entrance.
I pull myself together, readying myself to have Kotomine talk if he knows everything.

"!"
The priest is in the chapel.

It seems like he's been waiting for me...
"Oh, what's wrong, Emiya Shirou? I did not think you were admirable enough to come pray to the God when you are at a loss. Did you change your religious beliefs?"
...And he offers an absurd welcome.

"Shut up. I don't have time for your sarcasm. If you want to make small talk, do it alone."
"Oh. ...I see, you seem disturbed. I'm surprised you made it here in your condition. Why don't we go to the back if it's going to be a long conversation? It must be hard for you to stay on your feet."

"I'm fine. Just answer me, Kotomine.
 You knew that Sakura is a Holy Grail, right?"

"Of course. I opened her body, after all. I knew that she is a black Holy Grail that Matou Zouken coordinated."
The priest plainly answers, as if it's not a big deal.

"Do you know what that means...!?"
My head boils up in an instant.
I tried to be calm, but Kotomine's reply shatters my composure.

"Yes. I knew better than you what that meant.
 If we let Matou Sakura live, she would end up killing many people. That is why I warned you. I asked you if she was worth keeping alive."


I stop.
...He's right.
Kotomine did warn me back then.
He saved her, but he kept repeating that keeping her alive was a mistake.

"Then... then why did you save Sakura?
 I only wanted to protect her. But you don't have a reason to."

"I do have a reason. Like you, I did not want to let Matou Sakura die. I could not leave the new life within her to die.
 Humans die. Sakura's death would be only natural. Were she the only one to die, I would never have gone to such lengths."

"If Sakura were the only one to die?"
In short...
He's saying he saved Sakura to save that black shadow...!?

"That is exactly right, Emiya Shirou. It is the law of nature for people to die from wounds.  But you cannot kill what has not yet come into existence.
 You protected Matou Sakura to save her.
 I saved Matou Sakura to protect the darkness that she conceived.
 That is my motive. We had different goals, but we both needed the girl to live. Are you dissatisfied with the result?"


I'm not dissatisfied.
No matter what his intentions were, I had no choice but to ask for his help back then.
Andhe sacrificed his entire Magic Crest to save Sakura.
I should at least thank him for the result.

"...You're right. I'm not interested in what your motives are.
 But let me ask you. If you're saying that, you must know what that thing is."

"You must mean the shadow threatening the town.
 ...Well, I have an idea, but what about you?
 What do you think it is?"
"...Zouken said it's the contents of the Holy Grail. He said that what's inside the Holy Grail is coming out through Sakura."

"You asked him yourself, eh? ...I see, that is certainly something he might think of.
 So, do you believe everything he said? Do you believe the shadow is the contents of the Holy Grail appearing through Matou Sakura, and that it will continue to kill people as long as she is alive?"

"I won't trust Zouken. ...But his explanation matches the facts. I have to admit that Sakura and that shadow are related."

"Yes. Zouken's explanation contains no lie, but he is not telling the whole truth either.
 The power in the Holy Grail is colorless.
 It is colorless, so it will never attack people on its own. Power without direction only disperses."

"Oh."
...What he's saying makes sense.
First of all, why is something that's leaked out of the gate indiscriminately attacking people?

"What's going on? Why is it attacking people?"
"I do not even need to mention why. There exists 'something that kills people' inside the Holy Grail. That is the only possible explanation."
"Wha"
Something that kills people?
That thing is inside the Holy Grail and ruining Sakura?


...My vision wavers.
This is too ridiculous to be true...

But didn't I...

...Look up at such a thing ten years ago?

"! That makes even less sense...!
 If the Holy Grail's power is colorless, something that has a purpose like killing people shouldn't exist in it!"

"Correct. It is something that should not exist. It is a contradiction that should never have been created.
 But it is definitely there, within the Holy Grail.
 Ten years ago. I already told you how Kiritsugu and I fought for the Holy Grail.
 Its contents were already tainted at that time. The power that should have been colorless was instead a swirl that interpreted everything as slaughter."

"But it is a big enough swirl of magical energy to grant wishes.
 That function has not been lost.
 The only problem is that its idea of 'happiness' is to use the evil to expose the good.
 That is why it brought on that tragic fire ten years ago.
 I still found the Holy Grail worthy, but Kiritsugu destroyed it, unable to accept its evil."

"I need not remind you of the result. My Servant was showered with its tainted contents, and the mud that leaked from the Holy Grail burned the town and caused many deaths.
 You should remember the scene."

...Yeah, I did see it.
I saw the cause of it...!

"Then that black hole is..."
"Yes, it is a gate called the Holy Grail.
 How ironic. The cup that receives the purest souls.
 That pure object was completely tainted when a small amount of poison was mixed into it. It is colorless, after all. No matter how deep and magnificent the Holy Grail may have been, it was powerless against a colored foreign substance."

"Foreign substance...? That's what caused the content of the Holy Grail to change colors...?"

"Most likely. The Einzberns summoned something they should not have on the third ritual. As a result, an impurity was introduced into the Holy Grail War, the ritual they had prepared.
 Sixty years passed between the third and fourth wars, yet the impurity that had waited so long for its birth still could not emerge into the outside world."

"The fourth Holy Grail was too narrow.
 The war reached its deadline with Archer and Saber still remaining, and the Holy Grail was not complete. The gate did open, but Kiritsugu instantly destroyed it."

"Impuritythen that guy's the main body of the black shadow...?"
"'That guy' is hardly the proper term.
 Even if the contents of the Holy Grail are tainted, it is still only a swirl of raw power. What's inside is magical energy with a direction.
 It is a cursed swirl that is specialized and directed at killing people. It is a pure evil that is the embodiment of human evil."

"That is the phenomenon inside the Holy Grailthe main body of the shadow roaming the town at night. Well, it is still only an expected baby that cannot even produce the shadow without Matou Sakura."

"Expected baby...? Don't be ridiculous! Are you saying Sakura has to give birth to something mysterious like that...!?"
"No. It will appear from her body if she is a legitimately made Holy Grail.
 But she is special.
 That thing is trying to consume her and become the gate itself."

"Its birth. It is trying to come into this world by transferring its power to her.
 It is power without a body. It has no need for a human form. It can exist in this world if someone inherits its power."

"The content of the Holy Grail is not leaking out.
 It is an evil that is trying to bring itself into the world by permeating Matou Sakura.
 Thereforethe black shadow is not the contents of the Holy Grail.
 It is already Matou Sakura herself.
 It is permeating into the master, and once the power is completely succeeded, she will turn into the shadow."


...Hold on.
...Hold on a minute, Kotomine.
Even if you say that, I can't think straight.

"It was an incomplete Holy Grail from the start.
 ...No, she had already made the contract when the tainted Holy Grail from the last war was used.
 It would not have ended this way if the Einzbern's Holy Grail were used. It would have been filled with curses, but they would not be compatible."


Shut up.
First of all, your talks are too long.
You should keep things simple.
Like how that shadow isn't Sakura's subconscious.
That's what Zouken said, but the shadow is attacking people because that's its nature.
Sakura...
It's not something she wished for.

"The curse swirling within the Holy Grail. The curse would not have been able to take form unless the Holy Grail was compatible with it.
 Instead, it connected with something that could give it shape.
 It would not have taken a definite form if it were a normal Holy Grail, such as Einzbern's gold or a bronze using a body of a magus. It is a curse that has mass, after all. In some cases, it might turn into an expanding lump of flesh."


I said I don't care about things that don't concern us.
Get to the point.
Let me know the conclusion.
I thought I could save Sakura if I defeated the shadow.
I thought I could save her if I could defeat it before Sakura completely turned into the Holy Grail.
Butif that shadow is Sakura herself...

"The curse obtained a host named Matou Sakura.
 She is a human who was raised to be a Magic Circuit, embedded with 'the sense of touch' that leaked out during the previous war. The more she opens the gate as the Holy Grail, the more she will combine with what is inside.
 But do not worry.
 So long as she retains her sanity, the shadow will remain a shadow.
 No matter how much the curse may contaminate her, she still has command. As long as she tries to close the gate as a Holy Grail, the content will stay in her and not be able to escape outside."

"It is the same as the relationship between a Servant and his Master.
 The Servant, the curse, cannot use its power unless its Master, Matou Sakura, allows it. One cannot overturn this relationship, no matter how strong one may be.
 Matou Sakura's sanity obstructs the curse's desire to kill people."

"Matou Sakura can accept the curse as a part of her, or her sanity can cave in to the magical energy of the curse. The darkness in her will be given birth the instant either occurs.
 She is the shadow already. Even if the war were over, you could never return her to her original form."


That means...
When I defeat that black shadow and see its corpse...
Sakura's body will come out from beneath its darkness

"Haa    , ah."
I thought my heart stopped.
I clutch my chest and force myself to breathe.

"Then letting Sakura live means..."
"Letting that black shadow emerge. Her mind will eventually die, and hell will take form.
 Well, I did not think her body could endure it, but you have done well, Emiya Shirou. She is still functioning as the Holy Grail, thanks to you."
"!"

"Do you want to turn Sakura into a monster...!?"

"Of course. No matter what it may be, we cannot stop it as long as it has the will to be born.
 And do not misunderstand, Emiya Shirou.
 You call it a monster when it has not even come into this world?"

"Of course...! That shadow is a devil. It's a devil that's killing people without limit...!"
"You are rushing to conclusions. Good and evil are what we decide on after it occurs. Nobody can deny what has yet to exist.
 Or what? Are you saying the son of a criminal will definitely be a criminal? So we should kill him before he is born?"

"Wha"
How ridiculous.
That thing is a killer by its very nature.
And in reality, it is killing people!

"That is your mistake. That shadow has only been created from the host, Matou Sakura. What is about to be born from the Holy Grail is something different.
 That shadow is merely using Matou Sakura to suck lives needed for its birth. It is the same as a baby that wants to live.
 You cannot judge it to be good or evil, as it is doing so unconsciously."

"Don't be stupid! People are dying!"
"True. It shall receive punishment for its crime. But that is after it is born. Nobody can deny its existence right now.
 You cannot reject that which has not yet been born and cannot be punished."

"Look. A clear evil does not exist in this world.
 Butif there is an evil in this world...
 Would it not be the act of denying what is about to be born?"


I swallow my words.
It's not that I agree with Kotomine that Sakura should become the contents of the Holy Grail.
But condemning him won't change anything, let alone save Sakura.

"Kotomine. Is your intention to have Sakura turn into the Holy Grail?"
I ask with hostility.
It's a question to clarify our positions, a statement made too late to be a declaration of hostility.

"I said that is why I saved her. I will bless whatever is born.
 Just as you protect Matou Sakura, I will protect the embryo."
"I see. Does that mean you're our enemy?"

"Of course. But it's not that I want Matou Sakura's life, or that I want the Holy Grail's power like Matou Zouken.
 I will only protect what lies within the Holy Grail after it has been born. If the mother, Matou Sakura, should reject the child before it is born, I will respect her decision."

...There's no lie in his words.
This priest does not care who wins the Holy Grail War.

All he wants is the result.
He just wants to see what appears after Zouken or I remain.
He has no intention of forcing Sakura and altering her.
He is saying he will save Sakura only when we're unable to save her and when she turns into something else.

"...All right. I won't do anything to you as long as you're just watching. No matter your intentions, you saved Sakura's life.
 ...That's all I care about right now."

"I see. All I did was save the body of the mother, but I will not say anything if that is what you think.
 Well, is that all? Then go back to Matou Sakura. This is no time for her to be left alone."

"........."
The priest is worrying about Sakura's healthno, her mind.
We're clearly enemies, yet I still can't tell for certain.

"No. I want to ask one more thing.
 ...This will probably be my last question."
"Oh. If that is the case, I cannot refuse. All right, I shall listen."
"Kotomine. Can Sakura be saved?"

...The atmosphere changes.
The pressure from the priest increases as he gives me advice.

"There is a way. But the success rate is about fifty-fifty.
 The person called Matou Sakura will disappear once she is complete as a Holy Grail. But if her mind can endure the power from the Holy Grail for a bit, that small amount of time will be your hope."

"A few seconds at most.
 You will need to control the Holy Grail and use its power to eliminate what is within her.
 In short, you're using brute force. You just need to use the Holy Grail to kill the baby within her and the crest worm that is transforming her.
 The Holy Grail is tainted, but it still has the power to grant wishes. If it is used to kill, it can kill any form of life."

"So it all comes down to the Holy Grail, huh? From the start, this war is..."
"Yes, it all comes down to obtaining the Holy Grail.
 But watch out. You are directing the power of the Holy Grail at itself.
 A normal magus would not be able to control the magical energy, and it could end up repeating the disaster that occurred ten years ago.
 Not only that. It is madness to try to take control of the Holy Grail in only a few seconds. It's a miracle you will never achieve by yourself."

"Heh, but that's the only way, right? Then I'll do it. And if that's the case, I do have one hope."

"I see, you have Rin.
 Rin is Matou Sakura's older sister. It should be possible to tune with her sister's mind and moderate the reaction from the Holy Grail.
 But I do not think Rin would go with such a ridiculous gamble."


...That's true.
I'll have to convince her to change our course of action once I get home.

"It's fine, that's my problem.
 Well, bye. I hate to say it, but thanks. I don't approve of your opinion, but I'll thank you."
"Hold on. I answered your question, so I have something to ask of you as well."


I stop.
...I don't want to, but it's nothing if I can return the favor.

"What? You're the one that said this is it. Make it short."
"Well. Let's say by some chance, you do save Matou Sakura with this method.
 But are you fine with that, Emiya Shirou? Even if Matou Sakura is not a Holy Grail anymore, it will not change the fact that she ate humans. Are you going to protect such a sinner?"


It stops.
My heart freezes.

"You are not the only one who cannot bear it.
 Matou Sakura has killed many. I do not think she will be able to forgive herself."
"That's"
"It must be painful to commit a crime and live on, knowing you cannot atone for it. Then is it not better to just kill her?
 It is less painful that way, and it will be an apology to all who she has killed."


...That's right.
The chain would end right there.
It doesn't matter if she intended to or not.
No matter the reason, the assailant must be punished.
If she took lives, she must repay the victims with something of equal value.

So kill.
My morals tell me I must kill Sakura if I truly pity the victims.

Not only that.
If I can't save Sakura and she becomes a Holy Grail, nothing can stop her.
Many more lives will be lost.
Just like that day.
Innocent people will die without knowing the meaning of their death.

I swallow the gastric juice coming up my throat.
My eyes become bloodshot.
I might bleed out of my eyes.
I slash the pressre with thousands of swords and...
"Right. But that won't be atonement."
...I confess that I'll still protect Sakura.

"I see. So that means you will not follow Kiritsugu's path."
He talks as if he's disinterested.
The priest regards me with a bored expression, as if disappointed.

"Father's path...?"
"That's right. Your father loved humans.
 Higher, wider, farther. He loved humans as they go over their limits without end. That is why he turned himself into the definite evil.
 That man would have killed Matou Sakura. He threw away his human emotions for the sake of justice."

"...Is that any different from you?
 Casting away one person's happiness for the sake of justice, for many people's happiness."
"No. What you people call happiness did not bring me joy."

"Huh...?"
That's not a reply.
No, more than that...
He's not even looking at me.

"Right, we were different.
 He threw away what he had, but I had nothing to throw away.
 The result was the same, but the process was completely different.
 His existence was too unpleasant. His agony was truly unpleasant.
 If he went to such lengths to cast it away, he should never have had it in the first place. But still he agonized over his decision, trying to pick it back up after he threw it away. As if saying that is the correct way for humans to live."

"The difference was crucial. Yes. If I cannot obtain anything, why was I born into this world?"

The priest's words are not directed at anyone.
...But they contain anger.
They contain emotion, which I thought this man did not have.

"...Hah. Come to think of it, there is no way you can succeed Kiritsugu. He did what was necessary by throwing things away, but you insist on having it both ways.
 We are similar, you and I.
 You died once and broke down when you were resurrected. It is posteriori, but you are like me, a defect from birth."
"What...? What part of me is broken?"

"You just do not realize it.
 You have no concept of self. So I did not think you would concern yourself with a single person. No, rather"
You are not concerned about many, but concerned about all as if they were only one.
Yes.
Kotomine Kirei sounds almost envious as he speaks to himself.

"Anyway. I will not stop you if you plan to save Matou Sakura in spite of everything. Be burdened with as much sin as you want.
 But let me warn you.
 If you want to save Matou Sakura in any way, you will need to kill Matou Zouken. He will take over her body after her mind disappears. You will not be able to save her after that."

"You mean Zouken will take over Sakura?"
"Yes. His main body is a parasite. I do not know where the worm with his soul exists, but it is easy for him to take over another's body as long as it is alive.
 He is immortal, in a way. You cannot completely eliminate him unless you find that tiny main body or purify his soul itself."

"I see. That's actually a relief. I have to defeat Zouken either way."
"Hah. I see, it is certainly easy to understand.
 Defeat Matou Zouken and make Matou Sakura the winner. Control the Holy Grail that appears and purify Matou Sakura's body. So that is your course of action."

I don't want to, but I nod.
The plan should be simple, like Kotomine said.

"This is just my personal opinion, but Matou Sakura's mind is surprisingly strong and too well-suited to the curse in the Holy Grail.
 If Rin is the positive, she is the negative. If Matou Zouken made a mistake, it is right there. That black shadow has developed Matou Sakura over his expectations. That must be why he contacted you."

"Protect Matou Sakura.
 If she can survive the emergence, she should not die."
I don't say anything, but nod back.
Kotomine wants Sakura to change.
But he's still much better than Zouken.

"You won't get to take any part in this. I won't let such a mysterious thing be born."
"That is the spirit. Whatever happens, do not let Zouken have her."
With a snort, I turn my back to him.

I have no business here.
I have to quickly go back to Sakura.
"Come here, you bitch...!"
"Kya...!"

He pushes her down.
Attacked from behind and still unable to move her limbs, the girl easily falls to the bed.

"You traitor! You're home late!"
He gets on top of her as he screams.
He scowls at the girl he pulled to this room, running his fingers across the skin he hasn't touched in a while.
"!"
The girl's chin jumps.
The fingers, violating her as they crawl from her neck to her breasts, are a sign of the start.

Yes, the sequence is always the same.
This man is the absolute master.
The girl loses her will, opens up her body, and exposes her shame when he orders her.
The only resistance came during the first time.
The secret affairs after that were the same.
The girl made no attempt to fight back, never showing even a sign of emotion.
She was violated, attended to his needs, and drowned in lewdness like she was told to.

The reaction is the start of a regular routine.
Even if she shows no emotion, her body cannot suppress the pleasure.
Her lustful body reacts happily as it accepts men.

"Hahyeah, that's what I expect from you!
 That's right, you don't change, no matter how quiet you pretend to be.
 You're a Matou woman. You're a vulgar failure of a magus, a whore that wants men's sperm!"
The man roughly pushes down the girl's body.
"Hm...! No"
A spasm runs through her.
The man smiles, believing the reaction is the same as always.

It's no different.
Their relationship will never change, no matter where the woman may run.
Even if she regains her emotion or finds another man, she will want him once he pushes her down.
This woman is his possession.
It doesn't matter if she is the heir. She is merely a toy given to him.

That's why he doesn't notice until it happens.
The girl struggling beneath him feels no excitement.
He doesn't notice that she's filled with nothing but disgust and loathing.

"Oh, you sure are energetic today. I see, so Emiya wasn't able to satisfy you. I see, I see, that's great!
 I bet Emiya is depressed now!
 The girl he fell in love with was a real sex maniac!"
Does that knowledge please him more than the act of violating her?
The man laughs from the bottom of his heart and reaches out for her clothes.
He'll do the usual.
He will not undress her.
He always exposes her body.
He rips the clothes off her, as if tearing her apart.

"Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's have a wild fuck."
A crack opens in the girl's chest.
At that instant...
"Nostop!  Don't come near me, Nii-san...!"
The girl refuses the man with all her might.

"Huh?"
The man stops.
He lets go of her breasts, then looks down at the girl as one might look at a mysterious thing.

"What did you say? What did you just say?"
A voice of surprise.
The girl gulps, but stares resolutely back at him.

"I-I said please don't come near me. I won't obey you anymore.
 ...Senpai accepted a girl like me. He said he'll protect me...! I'm not yours, Nii-san! I'm Senpai's now...!"

The girl frantically tries to push the man off of her.
But the man will not even budge.
It's only natural. Her strength cannot push a man back, least of all when he has her in a mounted position.
"Wha"
A hollow voice.
The man looks down at the girl on the bed.

"Shut up. Shut up, shut up, shut up, you whore!"
And he starts punching his sister in a rage.

"Emiya's...!? You won't do as I tell you...!?
 Don't get it wrong, you don't have such a right! I'm the one to decide! You just have to nod back like always...!"
He does not hold back.
The man has no sanity left, having been denied by his possession, something that should never betray him.

"Take it back, Sakura! You're mine. You're nobody else's...! Know your place! You were sold to Matou...! So you have no right to disobey me...!"
He punches her as though he has gone mad.
;  "          "
The girl does not fight back.
She doesn't even protect her face from the punches.
Her eyes show great determination, condemning the man on top of her.

"......!"
That is the last straw.
He can't stand the look in her eyes.
He doesn't want her staring straight at him.

So...
"I see. Then I have a plan too. Do what you want if you like Emiya so much.
 ...But Sakura. You shouldn't hide things from someone you love, right?"
He decides to reveal everything the girl fears the most.

"Nii-san."
Her eyes open wide.
"Hah."
He laughs.
The expression of despair pleases him a bit.

"That's right, Sakura. I'll tell Emiya all about it. He accepted you, right? Then this is nothing at all."
"N"
She can't form the words.
The girl stares in astonishment.
She looks up at her older brother with empty eyes, just like before.

"Hah. Haha, ahahahahahahaha!
 That's right, that's all you can manage! Just be obedient if you don't want that. You're my toy. Don't disobey me no matter what...!"
The laughter fills the room.
But for the girl, it only sounds like annoying howling.

"y?"
Why?
The girl asks, her mind empty.

She doesn't want her SenpaiShirou to find out about her secret.
The relationship with her brother, her task to supervise the Emiya household, and her eleven years of life in the basement.
Her Senpai knows.
He already knows.
The only thing he doesn't know about is her relationship with her brother. But he should not hate her, even after finding out about it.
Shirou will probably forgive her.

"Oh."
Right.
Just like last night, he will destroy something in order to accept her.
But that's why she cannot bear it.
She doesn't want to take anything more away from him. She would rather keep things like this.
She can let her brother rape her, like she always does.

"N"
But she can't.
...She was able to bear it until now.
But now her body belongs to Shirou... and the thought of giving that body to her brother disgusts her.

"o."
She cannot accept either.
She doesn't want to be violated by her brother, and she doesn't want him to tell Shirou about their secret.

All that's left is her naked emotion.
The mind that has been suppressed for eleven years...

The man grabs her breasts.
Her brother tries to expose her body as if it's natural to do so.
"NoNo, no, no, no...! Stop, I don't want this, please stop, Nii-san...!"
She resists with all her might.
He laughs at her futile efforts.

"Hah, what are you saying? You want it, right? You don't care as long as it's a man. Oh, that's why I have to tell Emiya about it. About how bad you clung onto me and how dirtily we fucked...!"
He laughs.
He laughs.
Her brother laughs.


And she realizes.
He will tell him.
No matter what happens, no matter what she does, he will tell her Senpai about it.
...No matter what.
He intends to ruin her for his own amusement.

"Why?"
She murmurs.
Why does it always end up like this?
She endured so many things so he wouldn't find out about it.
She lied, lied to others, lied to herself, and kept telling herself that she could be happy.
She thought she was happy just by being at her Senpai's house.

But...
Why isn't he protecting such a small thing?

...No, he's not the only one who isn't protecting her.
She thought for a long time.
She has cursed for a long time.
Why.
Whythe world around her hates her so much


The strength floods out of her body.
She loses her will to resist, and her brother looks down at her in satisfaction.

"HaHaha, hahahahahahahahahaha!
 Come on, spread your legs like you always do, bitch...!
 You wouldn't even care if a dog fucked you, right!? All you can do is accept a man...!"
Asserting his dominance, he starts to violate her like he always does.
The girl stares up him with empty eyes.
"I wish he wouldn't exist."
Eleven years.
She thinks something she has never thought during that time.


The air makes a sound.
The man on top of her falls down.
Fresh blood splatters onto her.
The girl raises her body and looks at her silent brother.

"Oh."
It was an instant death.
He must have been hit with a very sharp string.
A line is visible on the back of his head, as if it was drawn in with a pencil.
The line reaches his brain, but the line is too thin to make his brain spill out, and his blood is the only thing flowing out.

"Oh."
She looks down at it without emotion.
The shadow that killed her brother wavers.
It wavers in the gray sunlight.
Her own shadow...
Her own shadow is standing up and wavering.

"Ah."
So she's the one that killed.
It was she who killed her brother.
She understands, but does not feel anything.
She feels nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
No disgust, no fear, no guilt, no regret.
The only thought in her vacant mind is that it was easy.

"Ah, ah."
She's used to it.
This isn't her first time.
Because she saw plenty in her dreams.
She saw it in her dreamso did she copy what she saw?

"Ah, ha."
She doesn't know.
But she thinks she should've done it sooner.
If she'd known she wouldn't feel anything, she would've done it a long time ago.
She thinks, and...
"FuFufu."
...Her empty emotion murmurs that it was fun.

It was fun.
It was fun.
It was fun...?
It was fun...?

Where?
When?
What?

Dream.
Dream.
That's right. She wasn't dreaming.
Those dreams were

Not dreams.
The one that wandered through the night and killed the men was herself.
Yes, she killed many people.
She killed many, many people.
KILLED those that ran away KILLED without leaving a drop KILLED everyone KILLED with pleasure KILLED laughing KILLED laughing KILLED laughing...!!

"Aha. Ahaha. Ahahaha."
It's so funny, she laughs.
Because she'll break down unless she laughs.
She can't bear it unless she's laughing.
But more tears flow out the more she laughs, and everything becomes meaningless for her.

"Haha! Ahaha, hahahahahahahaha!"
It's so funny that her stomach hurts.
It's as if she's regressing mentally every time she laughs.
But it's so comforting and natural.
Oh, how stupid, how stupid, how foolish...!

"FuFufu, ah."
Her face is contorted in a manic grin.
In place of her silent brother, the girl sweetly spills out a voice like glass.

...And like that.
After tinkering with her brother's body like she's playing house, she gets up.
She stands in front of the mirror, still covered in blood.
Behind her stands the shadow that killed so many.

Her own shadow.
The black shadow that has eaten countless people.
Someone was there, trying hard not to turn her into it.
Someone was there by her side.
She laughs.
There was never any hope for her.

"I see. I was slowly going crazy."
She twirls in front of the mirror.
The girl makes a proud smile.
"Look, Senpai. I was crazy from the beginning."
And speaks as if asking for a dance.

The girl's consciousness ends there.
No, to be more accurate, it changes.
It's merely that her repressed subconscious has risen to the surface.

Something talks to the girl.
Behind her.
The darkness stays as darkness, shows up as a presence, and looks at the girl.

"You have killed many people, Sakura."
The girl doesn't reply.
She doesn't even need to acknowledge such a question.

"You cannot live as a human anymore."
The girl doesn't reply.
She doesn't even need to be told about it.

"Accept the shadow. Nobody can stop you. Seize the daughter of Einzbern and obtain the Holy Grail. That is the only way for you to live."
"Yes. As you wish, Grandfather."
She nods quietly.
Did she agree because it sounds fun?
Or did she just want to run away?
The girl doesn't understand her own mind anymore.

But the pain in her body goes away as soon as she accepts it.
...It crawls up.
Black mud comes out from her core and smears itself on her skin.
The pain turns into fire to burn her skin.
Like a curse...
It turns her white skin into something else.

"Oh. With this, I..."
...Won't lose to anyone.
Nobody will get in the way.
She knows that she is the strongest one now.
The absolute certainty is similar to a sexual uplifting.
In her mind, the girl defeats everyone who has threatened her.
She pierces their legs as they run, rips off their arms as they fight back, stitches shut their mouths as they beg for mercy, chews on their eyes as they cry from pain, and finally gouges out their heart, laughing.

"Hm"
Her body trembles.
Just imagining it brings her close to orgasm.
...And in this fantasy...
Foremost in her mind is the relative she loves the most, the one called Tohsaka Rin.
"Damn, what's going on...!?"
It's obvious that something's going on in the yard.
A damp magical energy that makes me want to vomit is swirling so much that I can almost touch it.
I would feel the abnormality even if I weren't a magus.

"Wha"
I was prepared for it, but I get dizzy the instant I see it.
Tohsaka is covered by a shadow like coal tar.
Ilya is standing at the side of the yard, and Black Saber is standing in front of her.
And in the middle of the yard is Sakura, pointing her hand at Tohsaka

"Sakura!!!!"
I jump into the yard.
I have to help them both, but Tohsaka is in the most danger right now.
Covered in coal tar, Tohsaka looks pale, and it looks like her life is in danger.

"Tohsaka...! Hey, pull yourself together, you idiot...!"

There's no reply.
"Hold on, I'll have this off you in a minute...!"

I tear away the mud that's covering her.
The mud is gelatinous, but it's just like rubber.
I can't grab it, and even if I pull it off of her body, it just bounces back onto her.

"......! What is this!? I can touch her, so why...!?"
I can't get the mud off, no matter what.
I panic and frantically try to free her.

There...
"It's useless, Senpai. I'm the only one who can dispel my shadow. Someone as weak as you will be swallowed instead."
"Sakura?"
Sakura speaks in a cold voice I've never heard from her.

"Sakurayour face..."
My rage turns to ice.

...Sakura's neck.
Something that looks like a tattoo is consuming her.
It doesn't look like it, but it's a Command Spell.
A mysterious Command Spell is crawling over Sakura's body

"...I'm surprised. You came here in a hurry, Senpai.
 But you're confused. You saw what happened to Nii-san, but you're not scolding me."
"That's... fine. We don't have to talk about Shinji right now. I'll listen once you've calmed down."

...That's right.
I have to talk with Sakura right now.
Zouken said a lot of crazy things, but they're all lies.
Sakura is still Sakura.
She's talking to me like always and

"No. I don't want to talk about it, and I don't want to talk with you, Senpai. I'm the only one that gets to talk here.
 No one can scold me now, be it Senpai, Nee-san, Nii-san, or anyone in town."

"!"
A chill runs down my back.
No, this isn't just a chill.
It's an intensely cold thorn, as if a knife were slashed from my brain down to my waist.

"Senpai. Why are you protecting Nee-san?"

My vision whites out for a second.
A shadow is standing behind Sakura.

"Ah"
The chill runs throughout my body, paralyzing me with fear.
That's Sakura.
Even when I heard that the shadow is Sakura, I could bear it.
But now that I've seen it, I know.

...My left arm melted when it merely touched it.
The thing that went around town killing people like a machineis Sakura.

"Sa... kura."
My throat goes dry.
My eyeballs convulse.
My vision wavers as if space itself is twisted.
Every cell in me screams a warning, trying to defrost my frozen body.

But it doesn't melt.
Sakura's presence isn't human, but something different.
It's not her vast magical energy that got to me.
There's only one reason why my body's frozen.
Sakura is being hostile towards me.

"Yes. You were always like that. You said you'd protect me, but then you'd watch over everyone but me.
 But it's fine. I wanted you because you're that kind of a person."

My vision distorts.
The words from the Sakura I don't know cause my mind to break apart.
It tells me it's not her.
She's not Sakura.
Something I shouldn't think about fills my brain.

"My presence here is painful for you, right, Senpai?
 I know how much of a burden I am to you. You'll continue to suffer as long you're with me.
 So I had to get away from you."

The shadow dances around.
The ground is like a stage for a shadow picture.

"But I can't. You're the only happiness I have.
 And you can't get away from me. Because you can't betray yourself anymore."

"......Yes. That's why I'll kill you. Then you'll be with me forever, and most of all
 You won't have to suffer anymore, right?"

The shadow stretches.
It surges forth like a wave, trying to swallow me along with Tohsaka.

I react by instinct, pushing Tohsaka away.
The black tide sweeps over me.
I don't even think about avoiding it myself.

I was frightened.
I thought Sakura wasn't Sakura for an instant.
That knowledge wouldn't let me move my body.

I know this.
This is the darkness I was showered with before.
I'll go insane. I couldn't even bear it for a second back then.
My mind will disappear before my body if it falls directly on me.

"Guhah."

My body shrivels.
My warmth fades away.
It's more painful and frightening than I thought, so my body struggles to break free.
But I can't jump.
First of all, there's no ground to kick off of.
I will...

"Aheh?"
I realize that I'm back in the yard.
My vision is filled with purple hair.

"...Rider, you..."
"This is your order, Sakura. You told me to protect Emiya Shirou no matter the circumstances."

"Rider."
It's Rider that saved me from the black wave.
"Please do not move. You will faint if you try to stand up in your state."

...No, I can't even stand up.
I'm on my knees, and just breathing is enough effort to render me unconscious.

".........I see. You're going to oppose me, Rider?
 Then I'll take you in as well. I don't need any more Servants since I've absorbed something that wasn't in the plan

 But I'll specially make you just like Saber."

...The shadow stands up.
...Maybe she's serious because Rider is opposing her. The shadow coming from Sakura covers the whole yard.

...The whole place is dyed black.
Rider doesn't show signs of running away, but stares at the creeping shadow like a criminal awaiting execution.

"That's enough. You shouldn't do anything unnecessary, Sakura.
 You can't come back if you take any more in."

"Ilya."
The shadow stops its advance.

"...What does that mean, Ilyasviel?"
"I mean exactly what I said. Even if you absorb Rider, kill Shirou, or disable Rin, it'll be meaningless. You're wasting your time, so why don't you stop throwing a tantrum?"

...What's she up to?
Ilya walks over to Sakura.


"I'm the one you want, right? Then let's just finish this. I'll go with you, so leave them alone."

"Are you serious? I only want your heart.
 Coming with me means you don't mind getting killed."
"I know. But I'm going to be killed either way, and resistance is useless. You're the strongest one for now."

Ilya talks without emotion.

...It pisses me off.
In my condition, I can't figure out what Ilya's trying to say.

"Are you saying you'll sacrifice yourself, Ilyasviel?"
"Yes. That's my role.
 But the formal dress isn't here. If you want to open the gate as the successor, we have to go to my castle to get it."


"And you intended to settle things, right?
 Then there's no need to kill Shirou.
 You accepted it because you didn't want to kill anyone, but now you do want to kill them? You're contradicting yourself, Sakura."
"!"

...The shadow retreats.
Not only the shadow in the yard, but the mud on Tohsaka fades away as though it never existed.

"......All right. It'll save me the trouble of finding it myself.
 I don't know what you're trying to do, but I'll fall for your smooth talk."
Her long hair flutters.
Sakura turns her defenseless back to us and leaves, as if she lost interest in us.

"Sakura......!"
I scream for her to stop.
"............"

"...Please never show yourself again.
 Should you stand in my way againI'll have to kill you."

Sakura leaves.
I can't follow after her, or even call out.

"Sakura's right. Your role's already over.
 Dealing with the aftermath is my duty. I'll take Sakura, so you can rest now, Shirou."

I can't save Ilya either, 
"Goodbye. It was fun, Onii-chan."

and I hear a sad farewell.


Everything melts away with that.
My body stops trembling against the shadow.
My guilt over thinking that Sakura was someone else disappears.

I'm pissed.
I was trembling miserably, unable even to take Sakura's hand.
Not only that.
I made Ilya, the one who called me Onii-chan, make a face like that!

"Idiot!"
I run.
My whole body feels like lead and my brain churns with cold nausea, but I follow after them.

"Do not pursue them. I will kill you if you take another step."
"......!"
A black servant blocks my way.
She points her sword at me, overwhelming us without saying a word.

"...Please get out of my way, Saber. I can't let those two leave like that."
"That is my line. I cannot let you follow after them. ...And even if I do withdraw, what can you do?"


"...This is your final warning. Sakura will obtain the Holy Grail one way or another. That is the only way for her to be released.
 Even if the result is her death, Matou Sakura will be saved."

"If you wish to save her, then withdraw.
 Should you follow us in spite of thatI will take your head."

...Black Saber disappears.
Sakura and Ilya are gone.
They've vanished, as if they've faded into the shadow.

"Da"
The spirit that kept me going until now dissipates.
My body drops to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut.
"mn."

...I can't stay conscious.
As my vision fades...
The image of Sakura drowning in the shadow sticks in my mind, as if to impeach me.

Let's make the final decision.

The outcome of the battle is decided.
Or more accurately, it was decided a long time ago.
This end has been determined ever since you lost Saber.

'...But Shirou. To oppose that thing is to go down the most difficult path.
 Please keep that in mind.'

That was said by the girl who fought with you as your sword until the very end.
The night you parted with her.
You promised to keep fighting by yourself, stop the shadow, and end the war.

There was hell.
There has to be a meaning to why you survived that hell.
There has to be a meaning to why you must keep living.
It's not that you miraculously survived while everyone else died.
It's merely that one person was saved by the sacrifice of everyone else.

You hated that.
To break through reality, all you could do was become a superhero that can save anyone.

I don't know what those tears were.
He destroyed the Holy Grail, denied his battle because it was wrong, and frantically searched for any survivors.
No matter what his intentions were, his tears saved you, and you were able to start walking on a new path with him.

But you were left alone on the path.
The man who led the way died, leaving the dream to you.
'YeahI'm relieved.'

Emiya Kiritsugu swallowed the sins for which he couldn't atone and left this world.

He couldn't save anyone.
So he wanted you to be able to save someone.

'If you are to deny everything you've done.
 The crime will judge you'

...I know.
I know what it means, and I have to atone for it using all my life.
I killed the me that I believed in for ten years.
The me that was killed will feed on me.

And this is the embodiment of that crime.
A saint's shield is useless.
Archer's arm will eat away at me, forcing me to atone for my sins.
It will bring an end far worse than death.

That's right.
It's only one arm. Now that you survived, you won't die even if you cut it off.
So why?

'You know it too, right? You can't choose all, and you can only save one.'

A girl that longed for her father, but lived seeking revenge.
She almost cried, but smiled and swallowed her words so that we could live together.
Saying we can't do such a thing.
We can't live long together.
So...

'Goodbye. It was fun, Onii-chan.'

     .

This is the final decision.
You
"Of course...!
 What about the match is decided!? I can't back out now...!!!!"

"That's the spirit. It seems there is no need for hospitalization."
"EhKotomine...?"

"...That is my line.
 You and Rin were abandoned at the door.
 I wanted to leave you two, since you made a rather ugly pair as abandoned children go, but you were also dead on your feet. Had I done nothing, there would have been two dead bodies in front of my church. A church cannot afford that image, so I had no choice but to treat you."


...I figure out the situation I'm in.
This is the chapel.
There's nothing wrong with my body. The energy that was swallowed by Sakura's shadow has recovered.
I lost consciousness back in my yard. It must be the same for Tohsaka.
Rider probably carried us here.

Rider has no means of healing wounded people.
Kotomine was probably the only one she knew that could heal us.
How long has it been?
The time is

"It is three in the morning. You have been sleeping for about twelve hours since you were carried here."
"Twelve hours!? That's half a day...!"
I get up from the chair I was lying on.
I can't lie around like this...!

"Kotomine, where's Tohsaka!? She was there too, right!? Where is she!?"

"I have Rin resting at her place.
 You only had your energy taken away, but she had her magical energy taken away. It would normally take seven days to recover, but the land of Tohsaka is good for her.
 If all goes well, she should regain consciousness by tomorrow afternoon."

"I see. So her life's not in danger?"
"No. The soil of that land is special. It is a ley line that is said to have been home to vampires. Rin is her family's heir, so she will be back to her impudent self if I keep her buried for a day."

"......"
I think I heard something I'm not used to hearing, but I decide not to ask about it.
Let's hope he doesn't literally mean "bury".

"I see. Thanks for the care."
I leave the church.

I know what I have to do.
Follow Sakura.
Bring back Ilya. Bring back Sakura.
Protect the one I love.
So what if the fight's outcome is already determined?
I still have the power to fight.
So this is no time to be hesitating.


There's no time.
I can't waste time going back home to find a weapon.
...No, these people can't be fought with weapons from my house.

Sakura and Saber.
Zouken and Assassin.
If Zouken is after Ilya, I have to assume all my enemies are at my destination.

"So, where are you going, Emiya Shirou? I do not know the situation."
"...? It's obvious. Ilya went with Sakura to protect us. She said to go to the castle if Sakura wants her formal dress. I don't know what this formal dress is, but they're likely heading to her castle."

"Formal dress...? No, never mind that. Matou Sakura has become your enemy? Then the victor of this Holy Grail War is decided."
"............"
It's irritating, but Kotomine's right.

Zouken and Sakura.
Sakura is obviously the superior Master, but she can't disobey Zouken.
...I don't know what she's trying to do with Ilya, but it'll end once she meets Zouken.
No matter how much Sakura refuses him, the crest worm in her body will control her.

"Hey, more importantly!
 Why are you following me!?"
"It will be too much for you alone.  If Ilyasviel has been kidnapped, I cannot just watch quietly."

"Wha"
I stop at the unexpected reply.
What did he just say?

"Too much for me? So you're going to help me...!?"
"Are you discontent? You will be fighting against the greatest force.
 Now that Rin cannot help you, my powers should be of assistance."


There's no way I'm discontented.
I'm happy for any help, but

"Why? There's no reason for you to help me."
"Of course not. It is just this one time. Do not consider me your ally after we rescue Ilyasviel. We can never understand each other."
"Then..."

"It is simply for mutual benefit.
 Furthermore, they defeated all my Servants. Is that not a good enough reason?"

...There's no lie in his words.
A lot has happened between us, but he has never lied to me.
I
...I lose the will and the desire to get back up.
I close my eyes as if falling asleep.

There's nothing ahead of me.
My Holy Grail War ends here.
Or rather, it never really began.
"I refuse. You're Sakura's enemy. I can't trust you with my back."
"I see. I thought I could be of some help, but this is unfortunate."
The priest stops.
...I have no time to waste.
I have to follow after Sakura as quickly as possible.

It's daybreak when my taxi arrives at the forest.
A student taking a taxi at three in the morning is suspicious enough, so wanting to be dropped off in the outskirts must've been too much.
After twelve tries, I finally found a taxi that'd drop me off at the forest, and it's already morning by the time I finally get there.

...This is my second time here.
Using my memory, I head to the castle.
...I couldn't reach it the last time I was here.
It's because I met Ilya, who was running from the shadow, on the way.


...I check my left arm.
I lost my arm at that time.
The shadow nearly killed me, and there was nothing I could do about it.
It's the same now.
I have no way to match the shadow even if I encounter it, and they also have Saber.

...It'll be the end once I encounter them.
If I'm to get Ilya back, a surprise attack will be the only way.
I'll rescue Ilya without Sakura noticing.
Then

What should I do after that?
What can I do to Sakura?
How can I return Sakura to the way I knew her?

"........."
I have no answer.
All I can do is to try to catch up to them as quickly as possible.

I emerge in a familiar place.
It's been two hours since I entered the forest.
The sun should already be up, but the trees are still shrouded in morning mist.

...This is where I stopped last time.
If the scene Ilya showed me is right, the Einzbern castle should be near here.
A bit more.
A bit more, and I'll reach the enemy base.

I come out into a clearing.
An empty, circular space within the vast forest.
The castle I saw through Ilya's eyes is standing there, just like I remembered.

There's no one around.
It's strange that there's no watch anywhere, but I can't back out even if this is a trap.

Going in from the front entrance is out of the question.
Sneaking in from a window on the second floor would be good.
"I'll go to the back. I can get in through the back door if I have to."
There's no watch, even in the back.
I climb up a tree and force my way into the second floor.

"Whoa!"
I jump inside, breaking the window.
In spite of my forced entry, the castle is dead silent.

"...Are they not on guard? Are they taking me lightly because I'm alone, or..."

Have Zouken and Sakura left already?
...That would explain things.
It's been almost a day since Sakura took Ilya.
I don't know why they came here, but maybe they've already finished their business

"No, there are human presences. And"
A bizarre atmosphere shrouds the place.
An overwhelming flow of magical energy clings to my skin like heavy fog.
...This has to be it.
This is what Sakura's magical energy was like after the crest took control.

"It's thicker on lower grounds..."
Sakura's on the first floor.
...I can look for the stairs and head down, but I should find Ilya first.
I can't do anything if she's with Sakura, but I have to go save her if she's trapped somewhere in this castle.

All the doors are unlocked.
From the second floor to the third. From the third to the fourth.
I check every room for Ilya.

And in the very back of the fourth floor...
I come across a storeroom that's unlike any of the others.

"You here, Ilya...?"
...I call out in a whisper.
It must be storage because the room is littered with junk, obstructing my view.

"............"
If Ilya isn't here, she must be with Sakura on the first floor

"Who is it...!?"
I turn around at the sound of footsteps.
Standing at the door is...
...A familiar woman in a white dress.

"You're"
She's Ilya's servant, Sella.

"Please go home, Emiya-sama. My lady does not wish to see you."
"Eh... Hold on, you mean Ilya...!?"
"...Please call her Ilyasviel-sama. You do not have the right to address her in that manner."


I'm overawed by her ice-cold voice.
"That is all of her message. Make haste if you value your life. You will die if you stay here, Emiya-sama."
Sella bows and leaves.

"...Wait, wait, Sella...!"
"........."
Maybe it was unexpected that I called her name, as she stops and looks at me.

"Yes? I cannot tell you where my lady is, nor where your friend is. My only duty is to give you this message."
Sella talks without emotion.
...I freeze at the sight.


It's not her attitude that bothers me.
...She's like her.
I don't know why I'm thinking this, but Ilya and Sella are alike.
Their faces, demeanor, build, and age are different, but it feels like they're sisters

"...I will be leaving if you have no business. Please do not let my lady's consideration go to waste."

"Ohno, Sella. I came to save Ilya, so I have no intention of bothering you.
 You're Ilya's servant, right? Then you should know that we have to get Ilya out of this castle."

"How rude.
 But as you say, she needs to be freed as quickly as possible."
"...! Right? Then tell me where she is."

"...I cannot do that. Furthermore, there is no longer any use in telling you."
Sella quietly backs away.

"Wait, I!"
At that instant.
A black dagger is fired at me from where Sella was.

"Ah..."
...My legs give way.
Pain wracks my body, and I retreat to the window.
In front of me...
...Is a white skull glowing in the dark.

"Haa, ...!"
I grope blindly for the window.
...But what good will it do, even if I find it?
This is the fourth floor, and a dagger has pierced my chest.
I'm losing blood, and I should lose a third of my blood within the next minute.

"You were a fool to come here alone."
"Haa"
"I am not like the magus. I shall quickly free you from the pain."

"Guh......!"
I twist my body.
I don't care if it is the fourth floor.
I run to escape the death that stands before me...
But my carotid artery is cut when my hands are on the windowsill...

The skull grows hazy.
"Sleep. Salvation will not be given to you, but it should be better than being eaten by that monster."
My vision blurs.

...On the verge of my death, I feel regret.
Even though I couldn't waste any time, coming here by myself was reckless
We emerge into a clearing.
An empty, circular space within the vast forest.
The castle I saw through Ilya's eyes is standing there, just like I remembered.

There's no one around.
It's strange that there's no watch anywhere, but I can't back out even if this is a trap.

"Kotomine. Can we get up to the second floor from that tree?"
Even if they don't know we're here, it'll be suicidal to go in from the front door.
It might be useless, but I have to do everything I can.

"...Right.
 If we wish to sneak in, we should use an unused waterway, but they aren't the sort to fall for such time-consuming methods.
 They will notice our intrusion once we enter the castle. I would like to go directly to where Ilyasviel is held captive and escape immediately, but"

The priest looks up at the castle, pondering.
...He narrows his eyes as if trying to look through the wall, staring at each window in turn.

"What a surprise. It seems they really do think lightly of us, Emiya."
A happy voice.
"What?"
I've never heard this tone from him before, so I doubt my ears for a second.

"W-What, Kotomine? Did you find something?"
"I did.
 Let me ask. Do you have experience in mountain climbing, Emiya Shirou?"

"............Don't tell me..."
"I mean free climbing, of course. It is vertical, but there is no overhang and there are enough holds. We can maintain a secure footing. It will be easy to climb this wall without tools. Compared to a wall of ice, this is like walking down the street."
"Wai"
Kotomine puts his hand on the wall before I can stop him.

"Wha"
He presses himself against the wall and climbs up.
He's going slow, but I see how stable he is.

"What are you doing? If you cannot find the points, copy me. You should not be so weak that four stories are too much for you.
 Oh, and leave the Black Key. We can pick it up on the way out."
The priest continues to climb as he speaks.

"He's serious."
I throw down the sword and get on the wall.
...He must have picked an easy section to climb. The rocks are pretty rough, so I can manage to get ahold of them.

You don't just use your strength to climb up.
Knowing if the next hold is safe, knowing if the small hold can support your weight, knowing if there's another hold after you move...
A vertical climb is like a puzzle of improvisation.
Even if the goal is a meter away, you have to go back down and try a new route if you can't find the next hold.

A route to the destination.
The technique of thinking two or three steps ahead only comes with experience.
That's experience I lack, so I have to copy exactly what Kotomine does.
I'll instantly fall if I miss the target by a few centimeters or grip the handle with the wrong force.

"I can't believe it. You let an amateur do something like this?"
I grumble as I climb up.
...Well, it's ridiculous, but it's not totally reckless.
Normally, one climbs like this near the top of a mountain.

The wall isn't the only thing a climber fights against.
Just as the deep sea is a sanctuary that humans cannot violate, high places are also a sacred place.

There's not enough oxygen above the altitude of six thousand meters, and untrained people cannot stay there for more than a few hours.
Nausea, dizziness, brain edema from lack of oxygen, and finally, death.
This is a hell that gets worse the higher you go.

And intense cold. Your bare skin would freeze, and even a slight scratch would turn into necrosis.
Climbing is done in such extreme environments.
Compared to that, merely climbing a wall is hardly impossible.

"But still"
...It's still hard.
I can only use the tips of my fingers.
I have to put my weight there and support my body using a small foothold.
I can't keep up with him unless I've trained every inch of my body...!

"Hm...? Hold on, she moved. I thought it was above, but it's actually below us. Emiya, go down to the third floor window and go inside."
"Heyare you crazy?!"
I'm not a spider, so I can't do such a thing

"Kotomine, there's a window...! How can I go inside!?"
"I don't care, break through it."
"...! You fraud, if it was going to be like this..."
It would've been so much easier if we'd just gone inside using that tree!

"......!"
I jump into the castle.
I break the window and jump in using the same motion.
I grab the wall with both hands, swing my body at the window, and kick my way in.

"Haah......!"
I roll across the expensive-looking carpet.
My body was falling when I swung my legs.
If I'd kicked out a bit later, I would've hit the wall and landed back-first on the ground.

"Damn, I'd die if I fell on my head from the third floor..."
It's dangerous to kick into a window and roll while scattering glass shards, but it's no worse than expected.
"......Shirou?"
The instant I raise my head...
All trifling matters escape my mind.

"Ilya."
I forget I'm in enemy territory.
I recall what happened in the yard.
Ilya told me goodbye with a false smile.

"Unbelievable. Why did you come, Shirou? There's nothing you can do now. Are you going to waste your effort again?"
A cold voice.
Ilya puts on a cold face.


I'm used to it.
I'm used to seeing that face on her, but...

"You still don't understand? You can leave Sakura to me. This is my duty, so you can just go home and..."
"Idiot. Don't say dealing with the aftermath is your duty."
I slap her across the cheek, unable to forgive her.

"Wha H-How dare you...! It's not like a gentleman to slap a lady's cheek! I-I won't forgive you if you do such a thing to me!"
"It's me that won't forgive you, you idiot...! I'd be punching you if you were a guy, you bad girl...!"

I yell back at her.
I'm happy to be able to see her, but I'm really angry.

"W-What!? I didn't do anything to make you mad! I went with Sakura to fulfill my role! It was the best decision I could make, so you don't have the right to complain"

"Shut up, I don't care about that...!
 Look, I don't know about your role. I just came to bring back a bad girl who ran away selfishly.
 I won't be tricked, no matter how much you bluff and pretend you're all right. I'm going to take you home as long as you don't want to be here...!"

"Wha W-Who's bluffing!? I'm not hating it. This body is made to be a Holy Grail. I don't like becoming the key for them, but if I can use the power of the Holy Grail, Sakura will..."

"That's called a bluff, you idiot!
 ......Look, I don't care about the Holy Grail. Ilya is Ilya. If you want to stay as yourself, just ignore all of this. Don't sacrifice your life for someone else...!"


She looks away.
She bites her lip and...
"That goes for you too, Shirou"
...Murmurs something I can't hear.

"...Fine. Let's say I don't like this whole thing. What about it? We can't beat Sakura nor run away from her.
 It's impossible to get me out of the castle. That's why Zouken's letting me roam freely.
 He'll overlook you for now, but you won't make it out of the forest if you're with me."

Her red eyes reject me, telling me to go back.
I
"I'm still taking you home. I'm not going back by myself."
I don't even need to think about it.
There's no alternative in my mind.


Ilya just stares back at me in surprise.
I take her hand.
"Let's go, Ilya. We'll go home before they find us."
I pull her small, light body and start to walk.

"I'm stunned. Anything I say to you is useless."
Ilya starts to walk without resisting.
"Really. There's no way this will turn out well."
She happily closes her hand over mine.
"I'm still taking you home. I'm not going back by myself."
I don't even need to think about it.
There's no alternative in my mind.

She happily closes her hand over mine.
Purification by the holy word.
The priest's exorcism disperses Matou Zouken's spiritual body.
Only two figures remain.
One is Kotomine Kirei, leaning against a wall with wounds all over his body, his cloak red with blood.
The other is the masked assassin, bound to a tree by the Black Keys.

"You completely eradicated the magus, Executor. Did you know he was just a collection of worms?"

He turns to the voice.
Assassin is no longer there.
The only things on the tree are the Black Keys and a small trace of blood.

"...I've known him for a long time. I knew he was a spirit that used worms to tamper with this world. It would do no good to rip his body to pieces. If one were to kill him, one would have to completely eliminate his body, or..."

"Attack the spirit itself, as you did, eh?
 I see. The magus had a strong binding to the world, but he's vulnerable to the holy words of the Bible.
 Exorcist, eh? One might say you were Matou Zouken's natural enemy."


The priest doesn't answer, but checks on his wounded body.
The bleeding has stopped.
He's out of weapons, but he suffered no fatal wounds, and his strength should return once he rests for a few minutes.

"So, what are you going to do, Assassin? Your Master is gone. My holy words should have an effect on you now that your source of magical energy is gone."
"...I would assume so. My body will soon disappear. Without a Master, I am no different from the wandering spirits in this forest. My body will degrade to that of a lowly spirit within a day, and I shall disappear from this world."

"Correct. I can harm Servants without Masters.
 So, what will you do? Will you avenge your Master?"
"I am not so foolish as that. He suffered defeat because of his own arrogance. It is not my fault.
 But still, something does not make sense, and that I must ask of you."

"You must mean how your Zabaniya failed.
 I believe you obtained your arm from Shaytaan, but it will have no effect on me as long as it bears the name of the fallen angel.
 That arm punishes humans, so it cannot curse one of its own kind. As my heart is not human, it is strong against such a curse."

"I thought so. Your heart was the same as that girl's.
 You must already be tainted."
The priest doesn't answer.
He merely smiles ironically.

"...But how did you know? You could not act as you did unless you knew my arm would have no effect on you.
 Your intention was to have me use my Noble Phantasm, correct?"
"Yes. I already knew about your arm, Assassin.
 A cursed arm that creates an image of the target's heart and swaps it with the real heart.
 That's how you killed my Servant."

"! Then you..."
"Yes, I watched it until he died.
 It's natural that I knew about your arm. Your blunder was made the instant you killed Lancer."
"Damn, that was indeed a blunder."
Assassin tut-tuts in self-deprecation.
His hostility disappears at the same time.
He must be satisfied with the answer, as he quickly retreats.

"...So he went to look for another Master.
 I'd assume his next Master would be Matou Sakura"
That's not a problem for the priest.
It's fine as long as Matou Zouken doesn't kill Matou Sakura.

Zouken's wish is immortality.
He can achieve his wish by having Sakura's body turn into the Holy Grail.
The curse in the Holy Grail will not hatch if the old man is alive.
It's meaningless if Sakura becomes his tool.
She needs to remain a Master.
Because...

        'You will never find it.
         You were defective from birth'


He gets dizzy.
It must be because of the fatigue and loss of blood.
The priest leans against the wall and closes his eyes.

      It all happened ten years ago.

'Defective from birth'

The man did everything he could after accepting the fact.
He couldn't understand morals, but had common sense. So his teenage years were spent trying to overcome his defect.
But it never happened.
The man's purgatories and sufferings were entirely useless.
And his final attempt was a woman.

It's a simple story.
Every human wishes to love one of the opposite sex, have a family, and die peacefully.
Even if one may detest the peace, one can only dream about it.
This man is no exception.
He wished for such a thing, even though he felt no fascination in it.
He loved a woman, trying to earn ordinary happiness.

The man chose a woman with no future.
She was terminally ill, only expected to live for a few years.
Did he choose her because of that, or was that his only choice?
He still doesn't know.

Their life together lasted for about two years.
The man tried to love the woman.
The woman tried to love the man, did love him, and even had his child.
But the result didn't change.
It was because the man derived his happiness from the woman's suffering and his child's despair.
The more he tried to love, the more their suffering saved him.

The contradiction didn't make the man suffer. He doesn't even know if he suffered.
But the more the woman tried to cure him, the more he wanted to see her grieve.

The woman was a saint. She was sickly, but she was still a saint for him.
It need not be said how faithful she was or how deeply she understood his anger.
That's why the man was in despair.
No human will ever understand him and try to heal him to her degree. And this woman still could not fill the void within him.

Thenthere was no need to live and question right and wrong.
He was born defective.
His birth was some kind of mistake.
He concluded that if his existence was a mistake, it was best to disappear. And he went to bid goodbye to the woman before he died.
He made her his wife as an experiment, so it's his natural duty to go tell her of his end.

The woman loved Kotomine.
Kotomine tried to love the woman.
That's all there is to this story.

The end came relatively quickly.
"I could not love you."
That's all the man said in the room made of stone.
The dying woman smiled. She was unable to stand up, because her body was now composed of just skin and bone.
"No. I love you."
With a smile, she took her own life.

There was no way to stop her, and stopping her was meaningless.
The woman had a fatal disease. She would eventually die. He knew that when he chose her.

The woman, covered in blood, looked up at the man and smiled.
"See. You're crying."
He wasn't crying, of course.
It's just that the woman saw it that way.
The woman used her death to prove to him that he could love, and that he deserved to live.
The man silently left the room and broke away from the teachings of God.

Yes.
He certainly felt sad.
But not because she died.
The man, at that time, thought...
'How terrible. If she was going to die, I wanted to kill her myself.'

He grieved over losing the chance to enjoy her death.

It happened long ago.
He can't remember her voice or her face.
But sometimes he thinks, 'I wanted to kill her.'
Is that for his pleasure, or
Is it grief over wanting to kill the one he loved with his own hands?

He cuts off his thought process whenever the answer flickers in his head.
It's something that should be hidden forever.
The woman's death was meaningless.
Her devotion couldn't change him.
But the man didn't want to consider her death to be worthless.
So he stopped searching for answers.

...It all happened long ago.
The memory of the man who feeds on others' misfortunes.
The man later meets his nemesis.
Emiya Kiritsugu.
A magus that cast away what the man might have wanted


He opens his eyes.
It seems he fell asleep.
He checks his condition, starts to walk to catch up to Emiya Shirou, and...

"No, you can't go anywhere.
      Because you die here."

...Is interrupted by a girl.

She has completely changed.
Her black outfit is her shadow.
She's covering her body with her own dark magical energy.
The amount and the presence of her magical energy is beyond human capabilities.
She's at the same level as pure heroic spirits, the Counter Guardians.

"...You are completely tainted, Matou Sakura.
 You cannot change to that degree unless your mind is attuned to the curse.
 So you've accepted the fact that you're a human-eating monster."
Even though the priest wished for it, he still criticizes the girl.
As if to blame her for being intoxicated with her power.

"...Hah. But is it wrong to be drunk with your power?
 It can't be helped.
 Everyone picked on me too much. I think I would've endured it longer if everyone was nicer to me."
"Oh. Endure what?"

"Myself, priest-san.
 I finally understand now. I hate this world.
 The Tohsaka family that threw me away. Nee-san, who lived without any troubles. My scary grandfather and my pitiful brother. The people living peacefully without knowing about my pain."

"I can't allow such things now.
 ...I know I'm just taking my anger out on others. I know it's wrong, but I still think this way.
 Yes.
 I wonder what kind of face the people who haven't helped me will make when they realize I exist."

The girl smiles, as if it's a sacred pleasure.
The priest doesn't change his expression.
He keeps staring at the girl as if regarding something foul.

"You have changed, Matou Sakura. I see, your darkness was one of the qualities to adapt."
"Yes, I've changed. I'm not the old Matou Sakura. That weak girl doesn't exist anymore.
 ...Yes. Everyone tormented me until now. So I'm just getting back at them. The me who sat there and endured is gone."

She laughs.
Double personality.
The original Matou Sakura disappeared, and the other personality surfaced.
That's the only logical reason for her change.
But...
"What are you talking about? You don't need to hide it, Matou Sakura."
The priest quickly denies it.

"WWhat do you mean?"
"I said there's no need to hide it.
 You are not another personality. You were swallowed by the mud and have become addicted to violence, but you are still Matou Sakura. You don't need to prepare another personality to excuse yourself."
Her face stiffens.
He's absolutely right.
The girl grits her teeth and glares back at the priest.

"What are you saying!? You're the one who made me like this...!"
The girl's shadow reacts to her hateful voice.
A blazing infringement.
The shadow covers the ground in an instant.

"I won't deny it. I kept you alive so that you would remain its Master. You measured up to my expectations, and you are about to give birth to Avenger.
 You have easily accomplished what I could not."

"It wasn't easy at all...! You don't know how painful it was, how much pain I'm going through right now...!"
"I don't know, and there's no need to know. I'm not so mad as to listen to a girl's complaint."

"! ............I see.
 You're right. I don't want you to know.
 I won't let you feel compassion. I'm in a position where I can make anyone realize whatever I want."
She smiles cruelly.


The priest retreats without any hesitation.
He quickly backs away, like when he captured Matou Zouken.

The priest retreats with one jump.
She may have vast magical energy, but she's still inexperienced.
She has no experience with battle, and she's unskilled as a magus. It's easy for him to retreat.

"How foolish. Do you think you can get away from me?"

She smiles.
The priest falls to the ground at that instant.

"Guhgah......!"
He rolls down.
He falls to the ground, coughing up blood.
"Haahm, guh......!"
It doesn't stop.
He can't stop coughing up blood. Every time he tries to breathe, it wells up in his throat.

"How does it feel to have someone grab hold of your heart? Your life's under my control, no matter where you are."
"Mmguh!"
"You died ten years ago. Emiya Kiritsugu shot your heart and you died. But you stayed alive because of one reason."

"You're that... hmm, who was it? It's the Servant I ate before, but I guess his name doesn't matter.
 That gold person was showered with the contents of the Holy Grail, which connected him to it. But it couldn't taint that man, so it flowed into you, his Master. Right?
 And you were resurrected.
 Avenger. Your life was saved because Angra Manyu supplied you with magical energy."

"HaI see. Then this is..."
"Yes. You're connected to Angra Manyu. But I'm Angra Manyu.
 So I squashed it. I destroyed the fake heart that kept you alive.
 I can squash your organs too if you want.
 I can pull out your insides, no matter where you are."

She raises her hand.
How can she say 'if you want'?
The girl has no intention of keeping him alive.
No matter how much he may beg for his life, she'll laugh as she kills him.
He'll give her back his fake life.
Because it's hers.
Even if it's just a speck next to her total magical energy, there's no reason for her to let the priest keep it.

"Goodbye. I appreciate the fact that you saved me."
She grasps her slender fingers together as if to twist apart an invisible doll.
A crushing sound.
The priest's body is squeezed like a rag.
One more twist.
The priest will die in the next second.
But right before that...

"! Ah, uh, ah!?"
The girl doubles over in pain.
...She coughs up blood.
She scratches the ground, as if begging for help.

"Kuit hurts, no... don't... come in!"
The shadow expands.
...What happened? The shadow on her body expands, then slowly shrinks back to the original size.

"......No way...... Berserker lost...?"
There's no other explanation.
Berserker was defeated.
He died, dissolved into pure magical energy, and was consumed by her, the Holy Grail.

"AhAh"
Her mind distorts.
The personality called Matou Sakura is pushed even further into a corner now.
...She can't move any farther, but the great soul pushes her against the wall.

"Ah."
...She'll disappear.
She'll disappear.
Matou Sakura will disappear.
"Before that..."
She thinks of killing the priest, looks up, and is annoyed by her failure to follow through.

"Fine. He's... going... to die... anyway."
There's no one at the ruin.
On the ground where Kotomine Kirei lay is his blood-soaked outfit.
We reach the forest's edge faster than I expected.
It's probably because I had Ilya's guidance.
The car I arrived in is gone.
We started walking to town, stopped a car, and got a lift.

We're both filthy after running through the forest, making us look really suspicious.
So I jumped out in front of a car to stop it, and Ilya used suggestion on the driver to make him pick us up.
Man.
I never thought I'd get a ride like this.

"We're home, Shirou. Let's go in."
"Eh?"
We're back at my place in an instant.
The sun's setting.
It seems I fell asleep on the way back.

The sun has set by the time I make it to the living room.
It's past seven o'clock already.


Something's wrong.
Time's passing by too fast.
It was afternoon when I stepped into the house, so it's not possible for it to be night as soon as I step into the living room.

"Ilya. Isn't time passing by too fast?"
I talk to Ilya, standing beside me.


But Ilya isn't there.
Ilya is...
"Hm? The dinner was good, Shirou."
...Already in the living room, saying strange things.

"Dinner?"
"Yeah. I was surprised you wanted to get energy before anything, but I'm glad we did. You were so enthusiastic while you were cooking."


There are remnants of dinner on the table.
There are dishes in the sink.
Come to think of it, I feel pretty full.
It seems I really did make dinner.

"......That's strange. Did we have this in stock?"
"Nope. That's why we were dropped off at the shopping district to get some groceries."


I look through my memory.
......
............
..................
........................Well.
I guess that's what happened.

"I see. I guess I'm talking nonsense. So we had dinner, huh?"
"Yeah. All that's left is to rest."

"Hmyeah, we have to rest. I'm going to go change in my room. I need to talk, so please stay up. I'll be back right away."
Ilya nods.
I raise my hand in apology and leave the living room.

And the next thing I know, I'm in my room.
The instant I step out of the living room, I'm on the floor in my bedroom.

"Ah... Guh!"
I wake up because of the piercing pain.
A sword's pierced in my chest.
That's the first thing I imagine because my chest is hot and numb, and it feels like my life is draining out from it.

"Guh"
There's no sword, of course.
It's just an illusion.
The left side of my chest is simply rebelling against my left arm.
But I finally realize.
My sense of time.
The intermittent scenes are...

"...I see. It's not my sense of time that's odd."
It's just that my mind is screwed up.
It's not that I have no memory. I just can't record the events into my brain.

I can't hold events in my mind unless I concentrate on them.
It's natural that I can't remember anything that happened after I left the forest.
I can't stay conscious unless I'm in pain, like now.

"This is bad."
I frantically grasp at my fading consciousness.
Unless I consciously focus my mind, Emiya Shirou will disappear.
Only pain or the utmost concentration can preserve my memories.
In short, I have to maintain the level of concentration I had when I was trying to insert the Magic Circuit into my spine.


...I'm stumped.
I can't keep this up forever, and I don't know how long it'll work.

"...Wait. That means I shouldn't sleep."
Once I fall asleep, I won't be able to wake up.
Once I fall asleep, "Emiya Shirou" will never return.
Even if my body's unwounded, my mind would be scattered.


I raise my body.
I search through my desk. I need a small blade. Something I can hide in my right hand that'll dig into my flesh if I make a fist.
I can't keep up the concentration I have during training.
I have to clench my fist every time I relax so that the pain will keep me conscious.

"...Oh. It's not a blade, but this might do."
I find the crystal from that day.
...The pendant I found beside me after I was killed by Lancer.
I don't know how much magical energy was originally in this, but now there's not even enough for one strengthening magic left in it.

...That's right. Now, I can clearly think about who this pendant belongs to, and who could have saved me that night.
After all, she was the only other person at school at that time. I don't know why she saved me, but she wouldn't need a reason to save a life.

"Ah!"
My consciousness starts to fade away.
I'll think about it later.
I'll fall unconscious if I think about happy things and relax.

I check my condition.
I released the seal on my left arm.
I put the Shroud back on it, but it's only there to ease my mind.
According to Kotomine, the switch would be tripped if I used Archer's arm.
He said there'd nothing I could do after that.


But I can still move my body.
The problem is my mind, but I can stay conscious as long as I stay awake.
As for projection... I can probably project three more times using Archer's arm.

I know I can manage it once.
I'm scared about the second time.
The third will be fatal. I think my body will self-destruct, even if my mind's still alive.

"............"
I close my eyes and strain my ears.
...I hear creaking sounds along with my heartbeat.

...The thing invading my body from Archer's arm.
It gets harder to suppress his Reality Marble the more I use his Blade Works.  Eventually, an infinite number of blades will be created inside my body instead of outside.
...I don't even want to imagine what'll happen.
A thousand blades will pierce my body from within, killing me instantly.

"Don't kid me. I won't kill myself."
I'm in a hopeless condition.
I accept the whole situation.
But I reject the facts as they stand.
I won't die, and I won't self-destruct.
Not waking up after I fall asleep is just a product of my frightened imagination.

I'll be saved.
I'll be saved once I do everything I need to.
It's meaningless otherwise.
I said I'll protect Sakura no matter what.
So I can't just die selfishly.

"That's right. I have to contact Tohsaka first."
I don't have time.
I'll go to her house.
I'm worried about whether Kotomine's all right, but he's not my ally anymore now that we've saved Ilya.
I can't ask for his help again, but the promise to...

It's past nine o'clock.
I thought I came back right away, but it's been two hours already.

"Sorry to keep you waiting, Ilya. I'm going to Tohsaka's house, so let's go together."
"Rin's house? I don't mind, but why?"

"Eh... why? We have to meet up with Tohsaka. And I'm worried about how she's doing.
 Kotomine said she'd heal by tonight, but I can't really trust him. If she's not doing well, I'll need to look after her."

"Okay. That's fine, but Shirou..."
Ilya points to the wall.
Then.

"I'm glad to know you're worrying about me. As you can see, I'm all right.
 But if you were that worried about me, I wish you'd have come by my house before heading off to the forest."

"T-Tohsaka...!? When did you get here...?"

"I was here about an hour ago. I heard from Ilya what happened at the forest."

Tohsaka's in a bad mood... No, she's angry.
It seems she doesn't like the fact that I went to the forest without her.

"I can't help it. I thought I had to act as quickly as possible, and Ilya was in serious danger.
 ...Right, Ilya?"

"......Yeah. I wasn't locked up anywhere, but I could've been taken to the Great Holy Grail and had my heart taken out at any time.
 Zouken wanted to open the gate as soon as he took control of Sakura. I would be dead right now if Shirou and Kotomine had come a bit later."

"See. I wouldn't have made it if I'd waited for you."
"Who knows? So it all depended on Sakura, right? Tell me the truth, Ilya."

"Oh, you can tell?
 Yeah, there was a bit more time. Sakura's strong, so she won't easily break. I think there was about one more day to spare until she lost herself and fell under Zouken's control."

"I thought so. You shouldn't pamper Shirou too much. A little strictness is just right for him."
"You're right. I'll be grateful if you see to that."

The two criticize me.
But if the time limit was a day, I don't think we would've made it if I'd waited for Tohsaka.
I was faced with an important choice in the forest, but in exchange, I'm able to regain the time the three of us can spend together.

"!"
...I concentrate hard, since I'm starting to relax.
It seems the tension faded away during the conversation.

"......Hm......? Hold on, Ilya.
 You said Sakura might last one more day. Then the remaining time we have is..."

"Half a day at most. ...No, no matter how hard Sakura tries, Avenger is about to be born. Once that happens, she will change completely.  Nobody can save Sakura, and nobody will be saved."

Avenger...?
Tohsaka and I frown at the strange word.

"Yes, Avenger.
 It's the eighth class in the Holy Grail War. It's a 'violation' that the Einzberns summoned by breaking the rules.
 That's what tainted the contents of the Great Holy Grail.
 It's the main body that assimilated with Sakura, projecting the shadow because it couldn't go into the outside world.
 It's something that should not exist, consuming human lives to take form."

"That's Avengeran anti-hero that the Einzbern Master summoned in the third ritual."

"You know about it, Ilya...!? You know what that shadow is, and what Sakura's possessed by...!?"
"Yeah. I got the information out of Sakura, so I understand what's going on.
 What we have to do. What, exactly, you've made into your enemy."

Ilya closes her eyes once.
...Is that resignation?
Ilya sighs and then stares at us.

"What I'm about to talk about is the heart of the matter, and it's nothing that concerns you two. You shouldn't be burdened with this.
 Shirou, Rin. As you two are the last Masters in the Holy Grail War, I shall tell you the truth."

"Ilya?"
Tohsaka looks at Ilya in surprise.
I do likewise.
Ilya shows calmness and emptiness as if she's someone else.

"Everything started two hundred years ago.
 No, the journey of those who seek the Holy Grail began long before that. But two hundred years ago, the ritual was begun in this land."

"I'll start from there.
 The Holy Grail grants any wish. Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka cooperated to conduct a ritual to summon the Holy Grail.
 That's how the Holy Grail War came to be. A murderous battle between seven summoned Servants to determine the ownership of the Holy Grail.
 Magi who are chosen as Masters become the hosts of the Servants and kill each other until only one magus remains.
 That's the ostensible reason for the Holy Grail War that you two know of."

"You don't look surprised, Rin. So you had some idea of it, huh?"

"...Somewhat. I knew all along that I was being used, but I didn't mind it too much.
 I'm reaping the benefits by using somebody else's system. We're both using each other.
 I'm not stupid enough to get angry over something so trivial."

"Really? Then I don't have to explain that the order is reversed? How about you, Shirou? Did you already know that the process of making the Servants fight is unnecessary?"


...Well, I did know.

Servants are summoned by the Holy Grail.
The heroic spirits are summoned to determine whether the summoner deserves the Holy Grail.
Once summoned, they make a contract with a Master to stay in this world and obtain the Holy Grail. Then they go out to defeat the other Masters and Servants.

...In and of itself, that's not a problem.
But once I found out the defeated heroic spirits are absorbed into the Holy Grail, something felt off.
Heroic spiritsServants are only a factor in determining which Master is suited for the Holy Grail.
So why are they taken into the Holy Grail after their purpose has been served?

"...So does that mean heroic spirits are needed for the Holy Grail War, and Masters are just a tool to summon them?"

"Right. In the ritual of the war, Masters are mere receptors to summon the Servants. Once they've done that, they can die at any time.
 The heroic spirits are the only ones needed to complete the Holy Grail.
 Heroic spirits are pure souls separate from the time axis.  Though they are outside of this world's logic, they can still influence it."

"That's the power they needed.
 They tried to exit into the outer world using that power.
 That's the real purpose of the Holy Grail in this land.
 The Holy Grail Wars were waged to create a phenomenon, a miracle, that is still out of human reach."

"That's the great ritual to attain immortality that's said to have been lost by the Einzberns.
 Not a heroic spirit or a holy spirit, but a soul of a mere human that's fated to disappear from this world.  Bringing it about is an act of God."

"The name of the miracle is 'Heavens Feel'.
 It's the golden cup that's the third of the five existing sorceries."

"SSorceries!? You mean 'those' sorceries...!?"

The air tenses up.
Ilya says that the Holy Grail is a ritual to perform a sorcery.

Sorcery.
A divine mystery that cannot be reached with magic. An impossible phenomenon that cannot be achieved by modern people.
It's the ultimate goal of every magus, and those who achieve it are called "sorcerers" with envy and awe.

There are five sorceries acknowledged by the Magic Association.
As I'm not even in the Association, I have no way to know, but I've heard that there are five sorceries and that there are about four sorcerers.

"W-Wait...! So the Third Sorcery is the materialization of the soul!? But Servants are materialized souls too...!"

"No. The system does use a part of the Third Sorcery, but the heroic spirits are summoned.
 Servants aren't alive as part of this world or time. It's too imperfect to be the Third Sorcery. And heroic spirits can take form in this world without the help of sorcery as long as they have a host."

"Heavens Feel is not a spell that duplicates a soul perceived in the past.
 It's actually a spell to make an existence of a higher dimension that can take a spirit form and still influence the physical world.
 It takes a soul and elevates it to the next level of life."

"Next stepthat's certainly serious, but...
 Even though the details are different, all sorceries are a way to reach the origin! What does it have to do with the Holy Grail?"

"No. First of all, there's only one administrated land in Japan that can activate a sorcery.
 I know the ley line in Fuyuki is first-class, but there's not enough distortion to connect to the origin."

"Right. It's not distorted enough to reach the origin. That's why you make a hole. If the path is obstructed, you have to destroy the wall yourself, right?"

"The Holy Grail War is the process of destroying the wall.
 The process accumulates enough magical energy to grant any wish. But that's just a secondary matter for the Einzbern family. And it was also an advertisement to call for the Masters, the sacrifices."

"The Einzberns only needed a giant magic circle that could store great amounts of magical energy without attracting the notice of the Magic Association.
 The head of the Tohsaka family at that time cooperated with them.
 This country doesn't receive much attention from the Association, and there aren't many first-class lands that rank next to Aozaki's land.
 Fuyuki City was almost the perfect test site, meeting all the requirements."

"You should be able to figure out the rest.
 There are two kinds of Holy Grails that govern the Holy Grail War.
 The Holy Grail in this land and the Holy Grail Einzbern prepares.
 The former is a magic circle that uses the land administrated by Tohsaka.
 This is called the Great Holy Grail.
 The key that the Einzbern family prepares for each ritual is called the Holy Grail."

"The Great Holy Grail administers the system of the Holy Grail War. The Holy Grail collects the souls of the defeated heroic spirits and acts as the reactor core to activate the Great Holy Grail."

"And once the Holy Grail collects enough souls to activate the Great Holy Grail, it uses the heroic spirits' souls to open a hole.
 The Great Holy Grail fixes the small hole created when the heroic spirits return to their original place after their roles are fulfilled. This opens up the passage to the origin that humans cannot reach."

"Of course, this is just the first step. Your wish isn't granted even if the hole is opened. The path to the origin is too far."

"Butthe one who obtains the Holy Grail gains access to unlimited magical energy.
 The other side has large quantities of unused mana unlike anything seen on this side.  For an ordinary magus, it's nothing short of a miracle."

"......I see. So the Great Holy Grail is the magic circle which serves as the foundation, and the Holy Grail is the key to activate it.
 The Holy Grail Wars must occur on a sixty-year cycle to accumulate enough mana to summon the heroic spirits."

"There's no way you can carry out such a summoning with one person's magical energy.
 The Great Holy Grail draws mana from the land slowly so as not to deplete it, and once it's full"

"Yes, it summons the heroic spirits as Servants.
 But you need an incentive to summon the heroic spirits. They won't heed your call unless you give them what they want.
 That's why the Holy Grail was prepared to reward them."

"...Well, that's a deception from the start.
 The Einzberns just wanted the souls of the heroic spirits.
 They didn't care about their rank. They just wanted strong souls.
 To hide that fact, they created the Holy Grail War as a cover. They deceived the Servants and Masters and made them kill each other."

"...Well, I guess that started from the second ritual.
 The first was conducted in a foolishly honest manner and failed right away because the three families fought for its exclusive right."

"So the rule was made starting with the second ritual.
  Outsiders were called and made to fight for the Holy Grail.
 Masters from outside the families were just an inconvenience after the Servants had been summoned, so it more efficient to have them killed in battle.
 It was convenient for the three families because they could legitimately kill their collaborators."

"Unbelievable. So the rule for Masters to kill each other exists because they couldn't decide who gets the ownership by talking and had to resort to violence?"

"Yup. But choosing the last magus standing proved to be an even better method than expected.
 It's just like you. There were Servants and Masters that found out they were tricked, but it seems they didn't care. It's because you obtain the Holy Grail if you win."

Tohsaka's convinced.
"........."
...In short, the Holy Grail War is not a battle to obtain the Holy Grail, but a ritual to escape to the outside world.

Attempts to reach the outside world.
According to hermeticism, there's a power that governs dimensional theory outside of this world.
It's called the 'swirl of the origin', and it's a coordinate that's considered to be the beginning of all things.
It's the start and the end of all creation. It's the seat of God, recording everything and able to create anything.

"........."
But I really don't care about that.
My father would've understood what a big deal it is, but it doesn't concern me.
What's possessing Sakura is much more important to me than how it all started.

"Ilya. I don't care about the real purpose of the war. It has nothing to do with us, just like you said.
 More importantly, tell us about the thing you mentioned earlier."

"It has nothing to do with us!? We're talking about sorcery here! And the Third Sorcery at that! It's the taboo out of all taboos that's been kept a secret even within the association!
 If you're a magus, you can't ignore something like this"

"I can. ...Man, why do you have the wrong idea, Tohsaka?
 This isn't the time to be talking about something that can't succeed anyway."
"C-Can't succeed? What are you basing that on?"

"Hey now. I don't know why, but the Holy Grail War has never had a victor. That means there's something wrong with the ritual.
 ...First of all, how will you explain what's happening to Sakura? If the Holy Grail's a path to reach sorcery, does that mean Sakura's like that because of sorcery?"
Maybe I convinced her, because she shuts her mouth.

"So, Ilya. Why did the Holy Grail War turn out like this?
 Kotomine said there's something in the Holy Grail.
 So is this that Avenger thing? And he's not in the Holy Grail, Sakura or Ilya, but in the magic circle you called the Great Holy Grail?"

"Oh, Kotomine would know, wouldn't he?
 He's a magus tainted by Avenger, just like Sakura. He already knows what's inside the Holy Grail."
"Eh...? Kotomine and Sakura are the same...?"

"That's right. This concerns you two.
 This is about what Zouken's trying to obtain, what's changing Sakura, what's hiding in the Holy Grail, and what's tainting the souls of the heroic spirits.
 Its class name is Avenger.
 The heroic spirit that's about to take a living form through the power of the Holy Grail, a successful example of the Third Sorcery."

"...What? What was all that about sorceries not having to do with this? It does concern them."

"No. Avenger's materialization isn't sorcery carried out by the Holy Grail. From the start, it is a heroic spirit with that specific attribute.
 It can take form within the Holy Grail because it's Avenger.
 The Holy Grail merely summoned an avenger that can use the Third Sorcery, so it doesn't mean that the Great Holy Grail used the Third Sorcery."

"......? So in short, it's a monster that can materialize?
 It's someone who can embody the Third Sorcery even if the Great Holy Grail doesn't?"

"Yes. It all started during the third ritual.
 The first one was a failure. Einzbern was defeated quickly in the second war, and in desperation, they summoned a spirit that specialized in killing."

"They used an old scripture, a foreign folklore they obtained, as catalyst to summon the worst evil possible.
 They summoned what they shouldn't have summoned to kill all the other Masters, to activate the Great Holy Grail, and to keep all the achievement to themselves.
 The spirit's name is Angra Manyu.
 A murderous anti-hero that embodies every curse in this world."

"Angra... Manyu?"
...Hold on.
Angra Manyu is the name of the ancient Persian devil.
It's the embodiment of evil, the greatest devil in Zoroastrianism.  It fights a nine-thousand-year battle againts Ahura Mazda, protector of human goodness.
Zoroastrianism is a story mainly about the battle between these two gods. It's the first religion to come up with the doctrine of duality, the angels and the devil.

But the story contains no hero named Angra Manyu.
First of all, how can someone crowned with the name of the king of devils become a heroic spirit?

"That's not possible, Ilya. The Holy Grail can only call on heroic spirits, and you don't need the Holy Grail if you can reproduce phenomena on the divine spirit level.
 No, first of all, there can't be a heroic spirit with the name Angra Manyu. Even if there was, it would be a nameless evil spirit that left no mark on history. Even if it were summoned, its soul wouldn't be compatible with the Holy Grail."

"...Ilya. What did the Einzberns' Master summon?"

"I said Angra Manyu, Rin.
 ...He was certainly nameless, and not a devil. But a hero with the name Angra Manyu did exist."

"...Yes, the story takes place a long time ago. Insanely long ago, in a very small world.
 It was a hero that lived in a small, nameless village that practiced Zoroastrianism."

"I don't know how distorted their doctrine was.
 I don't know what led them to that idea.
 But they lived cleanly and righteously in accordance with their precepts.
 People are supposed to value goodness, protect the light, and live virtuous lives.
 For these people, segregated from the rest of the world, this supplication was absolute. It was probably the only source of human pride that they knew."

"Yes.
 The people in the village earnestly wished for everyone to live in peace.
 So everyone could be free from malice and live pure, upright lives.
 They renounced such human concerns as hunger, conflict, love, and hate. They were proud to be worthy of God's blessing."

"But it was impossible.
 People can't be freed from malice just through clean, righteous living.
 From the moment we are born, there is evil in us. You must take certain measures if you want to separate evil from yourself.
 Andthose measures were taken."

"They came up with a way to save not just their small village, but the whole world.
 It's hard to make everyone do good.
 But you can prove everyone's goodness.
 ...You just need one person.
 If one person embodies all the evils of the world, the rest of the people cannot be evil, no matter what.
 They seriously believed in such a simple, child-like theory."

"And one young man was chosen as a sacrifice.
 They captured him, carved every cursed word onto his body, forced every sin imaginable upon him, and held him responsible for all evils in the world.
 That's all.
 A small world. But an ultimate evil was born in this one complete world."

"The people cursed, scorned, feared, yet adored this man.
 They believed they were pure and righteous, since all the world's evil was within him.
 They seriously believed it'd save everyone in the world and created a devil.
 To demonstrate human goodness, they continuously tortured one man until he went insane. No, they would not allow him to die until he succumbed to old age."

"...The name of the devil that corrupts men.
 He was given the name Angra Manyu, and was irrationally hated by everyone in the world."

"I don't know if he really did turn into a devil during the process.
 But everyone in his village believed him to be so, and they treated him accordingly. They hated and feared him, but he was the proof of their goodness. They revered him as the sign of their salvation."

"He was the object of everyone's hate, but he saved people.
 His existence pardoned everyone of their evil deeds.
 Though his method was unusual, he still saved people.
 He became a hero for the villagers."

"And a hero was born.
 Hated by people, losing his self... Someone who transformed into exactly what they wanted. A helpless sacrifice that came to represent all the world's evil."

"That's the anti-hero Angra Manyu.
 An ordinary person without any special talent that was determined to be all evils of the world.
 The king of devils that approves of all six billion evils in Zoroastrianism. He's a curse made by a concept of ancient people."

Ilya finishes her story with no sign of bitterness or contempt.
...Anti-hero.
Kotomine introduced me to the term when the war started.

"............"
...But.
If Ilya's story is true, the guy who turned into Angra Manyu is still burdened with all the sins.
It's because that's his reason of existence.

A heroic spirit who's had six billion sins pushed onto him.
...If a guy like that is summoned, all that'll happen is a big massacre.
It'd only be natural for him to hate people, and first of all, everyone around him established him to be evil.

...Angra Manyu.
So the man is using Sakura to take revenge on the people... no, to carry out the role people pushed onto him?

"So I understand the story of Avenger... Angra Manyu.
 But why is he in the Holy Grail? He's just an ordinary person, right? Even if he's given a devil's name and treated like one, he's still just a human.
 That wouldn't turn him into a monster capable of eating the entire town."

"...Yeah. Angra Manyu is human. He was just an ordinary man, but was forced to become a heroic spirit. So there wasn't any problem, originally."

"...The Einzbern family summoned Angra Manyu in the third war.
 But the summoned heroic spirit was weak.
 The anti-hero was defeated in the early stage of the war, and the Holy Grail took him in. The Master of Einzbern grieved how this ordinary human could be a devil that destroys the human world."

"...Yes. The heroic spirit was merely human.
 A human that cursed the world.
 A human who everyone wanted to represent their evil.
 ...So he had no power. He was merely constructed by the people around him.
 But everything reversed the instant he was taken in by the Holy Grail."

"The Holy Grail grants wishes.
 When defeated, Servants are reduced to raw magical energy and are taken in by the Holy Grail to await their release. They lose their individual personalities and stay in the Holy Grail as an omnipotent power.
 But Angra Manyu was different. He was a heroic spirit that others wished for.  He was intended to be evil, regardless of his personality."

"No way. Could he..."
"Yes. The Holy Grail grants every wish.
 He was a mere human, but wasn't treated as one. So he was an embodiment of people's wishes.
 Sothe instant Angra Manyu was taken in by the Holy Grail, the Holy Grail accepted a wish."

"An existence that should not be.
 The heroic spirit constructed from people's selfish wishes was finally given flesh within the wish-granting Holy Grail.
 ...Five hundred years under the Makiri and a thousand under the Einzbern are nothing.
 After all, he's an ideal human that has been wished for since the age of gods, over two thousand years ago."

"That's what that shadow is. It finally obtained form as a heroic spirit.
 Angra Manyu used Servants' colorless magical energy to embody all evils of the world.
 Wanting only to be evil.
 It slowly matured with an ability to curse all six billion people."

"Then what? The contents of the Holy Grail have already been tainted by him? The wish the Holy Grail grants is already determined, and the fourth war took place only to store up the magical energy needed to give him form?"

"Yes. I don't know how much Kiritsugu knew about Angra Manyu.
 But believing the shadow leaking from it to be dangerous, he destroyed the Holy Grail."

"And his course of action was right.
 No matter what the previous Angra Manyu was, the Angra Manyu that formed inside the Holy Grail is real. It will become the greatest evil in the world, a devil that will kill every human being alive."

"But thanks to Kiritsugu's resolve, Angra Manyu was left unborn within the Great Holy Grail.
 Kotomine and Sakura received parts of it.
 Zouken must've known that a Servant was about to be born in the Holy Grail.
 That's why he implanted a piece of it in Sakura, creating a link between her and that Servant.
 He made Sakura a Master so that she can control the Servant once it emerges."

"No matter what Avenger is, it's still a Servant. No Servant, no matter how strong, can disobey his Master.
 That's Zouken's plan. He wants to use Sakura to obtain Angra Manyu."

Hold on.
Does that mean Sakura has a contract with this Servant, Avenger?

"Are you serious? Even if Sakura controls Angra Manyu that way, she can't resist the taint of the magical energy.
 She's already changed that much when Angra Manyu is still inside the Holy Grail, so her personality will disappear completely once it comes out. Then being a Master won't matter."

"That's fine. Zouken isn't worried about Sakura's personality.  What matters to him is her body and its connection to Angra Manyu."

"He's planning to take over her empty body after her personality disappears.
 ...I don't think you know, but Zouken can take over anyone's body as long as the worm bearing his soul exists. That's how he stayed alive until now.
 From the start, Sakura was just a body to eventually possess."

Then what?
The thing possessing Sakura.
If what's changing her is a contract with a Servant

"Zouken kidnapped me, probably because he didn't want to let Sakura open the gate.
 He wanted me to take the role of the Holy Grail, allowing him to take over Sakura's body once she became Angra Manyu's Master."

"I guess he plans to take over Angra Manyu in time, since a soul given flesh is a living example of the Third Sorcery. It's like speaking ill of a perfect God because you're a human with desires."

"......The definition of God's creation... It's something that's made from people's wishes, but not affected by people's intentions.
 Well, I bet any god will turn into a devil if it reflects Zouken's personality. That must be why Kotomine considered him his enemy."

"I get it. That's enough, right, Shirou?"
"Huh?"
Tohsaka's voice brings me back to the present.

"It's not 'huh'. We know our enemy, and we know Zouken's intention. Then we don't even need to talk about the rest."


...We don't even need to talk about the rest, huh?
She's right.
What's in the Holy Grail.
The disaster from ten years ago will be repeated if he comes out.

...No, that's an understatement.
He'll kill countless people if we let him be.
Yes.
Sakura's creation will take many lives.


I can't allow that.
Then I have to stop it.
I have to make whatever sacrifices I can to keep Sakura from being burdened with more deaths.
Stop Angra Manyu.
I have to end the war before he emerges from the Holy Grail.

"I guess you understand now. We have to fight and win.
 And there are only two ways to do this.
 Kill Sakura, Angra Manyu's Master, before he comes out. Or destroy the Great Holy Grail before he comes out."

"...The former's the more certain method.
 Sakura and Zouken will surely get in our way if we try to destroy the Great Holy Grail. We won't be able to do it without defeating them.
 So it's easiest to defeat Sakura."

"Yeah. Fight Sakura and separate her from Angra Manyu. That's the easiest way, and the plan's easy to understand."
"Oh. You have no problem with going after her?"

"...That's the only thing we can manage right now. If Angra Manyu is what Ilya says it is, it's not something humans can match. We lose the instant it comes out.
 Then we have to take the quickest and surest route.
 More importantly, Tohsaka. I don't mind fighting, but do you know where Sakura is?"

"That's not a problem. If Ilya's right, there's only one place the Great Holy Grail can be. Right, Ilya?"

"...Yes, you're right, Rin.
 Angra Manyu is about to be born, so Zouken is at the Great Holy Grail.
 The degraded ley line. The origin that was chosen by the three families two hundred years ago. Angra Manyu is being conceived in the large cavern underneath the Ryudou Temple."

"Under the Ryudou Temple..."
...That's where Sakura is.
That's where we'll be heading, the place where the Holy Grail War will end.

"........."
I take a deep breath and allow my tense mind to relax slightly.
The cold pendant in my hand settles my thoughts.


Fighting Sakura.
Tohsaka isn't lying.
It's just that our methods are different.
Tohsaka must intend to finish the war by killing Sakura.
But I'll end the war by saving Sakura's life

".....!?"
My body trembles.
The house is beset by pressure, making the air feel like water.
And...
"Sakura!"
The instant we realize the pressure's coming from the shadow, we run out into the yard.
".........Oh well. I guess I'm saved."
I have to find out what happened to me before I start moving around.
I'm still conscious.
I can figure out the situation if I don't let my guard down.

"......So. Why am I here?"
I think about why I'm here in the shed.
Sakura's warning.
Sakura warned us to run, and Tohsaka said she'd fight.
Thenthat's right, we have to go beneath the Ryudou Temple.

"So... Why am I lying in the shed when we have to go to the Ryudou Temple?"
I'm on the ground.
I realize that I'm inside the shed.
My right hand is hurting.
Thanks to that, my consciousness is back.

"Damn. Pull yourself together, idiot."
I get up and check how my limbs are doing.
...Don't lose spirit.
I'm certainly losing something at hopeless speed.
But it's not fatal.
At the very least, I should be able to fight normally until the day dawns.

"You look terrible. Do you recognize me, Shirou?"

"!"
I quickly turn around.
...In the back of the shed...
Shrouded in darkness just beyond the moon's reach, there stands a Servant in black.

"Rider. You..."

"Yes. I was watching you.
 My mission is to protect you, but Sakura is my Master. So long as she is the one trying to harm you, I can offer you no assistance.
 That is why I did not help you in the forest. It was your own fault to be attacked by Berserker."

Rider explains lightly.
...She speaks without emotion.
It seems she was waiting for me to be alone.

"...I see. Then you came here to..."
"To kill you. You and your allies are Sakura's enemies. Thus, I cannot let you meet her."
Rider's holding a nail-like dagger.
...I feel her hostility creeping up my spine.

"!"
Rider's serious.
I
I can't be killed here.
It's two meters to the door.
I can get there in one step if I jump with all my strength.
The problem is that Rider can close the distance long before I get outside.

"......"
Rider emits hostility that can be taken as anger or dejection.
...It might be because the shed's dark, but she looks like a giant snake.

", "
I concentrate only on the signs of her attack...

", Hah!"
And I avoid the dagger that's swung at me before I jump back.

"I did it!"
I jump out into the yard.
The rush of dodging a superior opponent's attack and the joy of escaping makes my heart beat faster.

But that's enough pleasure for now.
The fight just began. I now have to beat Rider somehow

".........Huh?"
I don't feel anyone coming after me out of the shed.
Rider slowly appears from within.
"...I have lost interest. You cannot kill Sakura with your skill. There is no need for me to kill you here."
She disappears into the night.

"........."
Rider's presence disappears.
Maybe she's left the grounds.
I don't feel her hostility anymore, and I don't think she's coming back.

".........Rider."
Did she let me go?
If my suspicion is correct, she might help us if the opportunity arises
I have to use Archer's arm.
I can't match Rider.
I can't afford to use any more projection, but it's better to take chances if she's going to kill me...!

"Trace, on."
I activate my Magic Circuit, not daring to take my eyes off her.
...I won't make any weapons until the last second.
I'll project something and counter her the instant she attacks me!

"......Projection. I cannot use you to your full potential, but an excellent swordsman would be able to use you as a Noble Phantasm."

"?"
Rider's hostility dissipates.
Rider steps back and relaxes, as if she's read my mind.

"...Rider?"
"I will let you go. I cannot use you.
 ...How ironic fate can be. If Saber were here, she would have been your partner."

Rider's presence disappears.
Maybe she left the grounds after leaving the shed.
I don't feel her hostility anymore, and I don't think she's coming back.

"........."
Did she let me go?
If my suspicion is correct, she might help us if the opportunity arises

She once asked me...
What was it?
Remember.
It was...
...She asked me...
If I'll be able to fight until the very end.

"......Rider. I'll fight until the very end. I want to save Sakura, just like you want to protect her. I don't know what result it'll bring, but I can't run away.
 ...I'll fight Sakura to save her. If you're going to stand in my way, I'll do whatever it takes to kill you."
"........."

There's no reply.
After a long and heavy silence...

"I understand your determination. But you cannot save Sakura like that."
...She leaves with those words.

"Rider...?"
"You fight in your own way.  I will save Sakura in mine."

The voice comes from afar, and there's no indication she'll return.
...Rider goes into battle alone, without returning to her Master or relying on us.
...She asked me...
If I won't give up until the very end.

"......Rider. I'll fight until the very end. I want to save Sakura, just like you want to protect her. I don't know what result it'll bring, but I can't run away.
 ...I'll fight Sakura to save her. If you're going to stand in my way, I'll do whatever it takes to kill you."
"........."

There's no reply.
After a long and heavy silence...

"I understand your determination. But you cannot save Sakura like that."
...She leaves with those words.

"Rider...?"
"You fight in your own way.  I will save Sakura in mine."

The voice comes from afar, and there's no indication she'll return.
...Rider goes into battle alone, without returning to her Master or relying on us.
...That's right.
She asked me under the starry sky.
If I'll be on Sakura's side until the very end.

The words I couldn't say to her back then.
I can tell her now with confidence.

"Rider. I understand how much you care for Sakura.
 You're stopping me now because Sakura will suffer if you let me go, right?"

".........Yes. Are you still going to kill Sakura in spite of that?"
"I'm not going to kill her. I'm going to save her.
 Rider. I'm going to protect Sakura until the very end. I'm going to choose Sakura no matter what."

"Soplease lend me your power. Tohsaka and I can't do this alone. If you care for Sakura, please help us."

"Is that...
 Your answer to my question from the other day?"
I nod.

"............Very well.
 But I will not fight unless there is a chance to win. What do you expect of me, Shirou?"

What I expect from Rider?
There's only one thing.
Rider's the only one out of all the Servants that can oppose Saber's Noble Phantasm, Sakura's strongest card.

"I have some questions before that. Can you still use your Noble Phantasm?"
"Yes. Sakura still supplies me with magical energy."

"Right, next question. Are Servants still spirits even if they take physical form? So you can't hurt them with normal weapons?"

"...Let's see. A normal Servant will be able to nullify them, but those consumed by Sakura are another matter.
 Having received bodies from Sakura, they cannot return to spiritual form.
 Strong magical weapons should be able to penetrate through their shadows."

"I see, then it's decided. There's a chance of victory, and the roles are clear.
 Rider. I want you to beat Saber one-on-one. To be specific"

I whisper in her ear.
...I know nobody's listening, but I'm just making sure.

"I see. I can definitely penetrate her guard with that.
 It is a pure contest of power. Nothing is left to chance."
"Right? ...Well, if there is a problem..."

"It is your skill and my trust in you."

I nod.
Rider puts a finger to her mouth, thinking...
"Fair enough. I shall trust you and accept you as my temporary master."
...And agrees with a smile that takes me by surprise.
"...Do what you want. I don't know what your intentions are, but neither one of us likes Zouken."
"I see, common ground is important. I do have some relation to that old man."

We start down the hill.
We leave the church together without looking at each other.

Dawn has nearly broken when we reach the forest.
"Wait here. You may go home if we do not return by the time the date changes."
He stops the car on a road near the entrance of the forest.
Kotomine arranged for the car.

"So how are you going to help me?"
"Hm. Our method of transportation, to start out with."
...After that conversation, Kotomine immediately prepared a car and driver.
That alone is helpful.
It's past three in the morning. Not many taxis would take a suspicious student out to the outskirts right now.

"It is possible that only the boy will return.
 That is not a good situation. Do not wait for me and go back to town as fast as possible in that case."
Kotomine gives orders to the driver.
The driver nods silently, then opens the trunk.

"Emiya. Take the weapon."
"Huh?"
He throws a long, thin object at me.

"Whoa. Is this a sword?"
It's a slender sword.
It's like a rapier.
It's a sword made for thrusting, not slashing.
But the blade's a bit too thick, and it looks like it'll be hard to use.
It's like Assassin's Dark made into a sword.

"This is a weapon?"
"Kiritsugu preferred guns, but unfortunately, submachine guns are the only firearms I have right now. Bullets aren't effective against ghosts, and you're not trained to use them in any case. That's better for you, since you're a magic user."


I lightly swing the sword.
...It's oddly-balanced.
It weighs about a kilo, but the tip is heavy.
It's more like an arrow than a sword.

"...Is this a special weapon of the Church? I feel magical energy from it."
"It is called a Black Key. It is not magic, but sacrament.
 It is our exclusive right, used to fight spirits. If you use your magic on that sword, it should be of some use, even against a Servant."
That's if I can hit them with it, he adds.

"Make sure you do not get into a situation where you have to use it.
 Let's go.
 It's been almost a day since Ilyasviel was kidnapped.
 The place may be empty already, but we'll think about that after we get there.
 We should at least be able to find out where Matou Sakura went."
The priest, unlike me, goes into the forest empty-handed.


I take a deep breath.
I put the sword into the sheath and follow after Kotomine.

I take the lead.
I use my memory to head to the castle.
...I couldn't reach it the last time I was here.
It's because I met Ilya, fleeing from the black shadow, on my way to the castle.


...I check my left arm.
I lost my arm at that time.
I was almost killed by the shadow, and there wasn't a thing I could do about it.
It's the same now.
I have no way to match the shadow even if I encounter it, and they also have Saber.

...Once I run into them, it's all over.
If I'm to get Ilya back, a surprise attack will be the only way.
I'll rescue Ilya without Sakura noticing.
Then

What should I do after that?
What can I do to Sakura?
How can I take Sakura back to my house?

"Hold on. Do not tell me you intend to bring Matou Sakura back."
"Wha... O-Of course I intend to. I want to save her."

"Don't even try.
 We cannot match Matou Sakura... no, that shadow. It will swallow us without giving us a chance to talk. You should know that better than me."

"!"
That's...
It'll be just like when I confronted her in the yard.
But still

"Let it go this time. We will have our chance if we can put Ilyasviel under your care. If you wish to speak with Matou Sakura, that can come after we prepare something that can match her."
"............"

A force that can match Sakura, who has an overwhelming amount of magical energy.
...If anyone can prepare such a thing, it'll be Tohsaka.
I'll have to project the gem sword we were planning to use against Zouken and the black shadow

"Damn...! Okay, so I'm supposed to concentrate on saving Ilya for now, right...!?"
"Right. Then let's go. We don't have time."


I slap my cheeks to boost my spirits.
This isn't the time to be feeling timid.
I have to save Ilya.
Sakura said she'll kill her.
...I won't let her die, and I won't let Sakura do such a thing.
All I can do right now is to get Ilya away from Sakura.
Then I'll concentrate on that for now

I emerge in a familiar place.
It's been two hours since I entered the forest.
The sun should already be up, but the forest's still covered in morning mist.

"...She's here. The curse over this forest is definitely hers."
"...?"
Kotomine says something strange as we keep running.
...The curse over this forest?
Can he see such a thing?

"Kotomine. By curse, do you mean you can pick out Sakura's presence?"
"It is more like a resonance. ......Well, I do not care. But if we are to fight Matou Sakura, I will retreat.
 Putting you aside, I cannot harm Black Sakura. I have no chance of winning even if I fight her."
"......?"
Well, I have no chance of winning either. But...

"Hold on. What do you mean by 'Black'? Sakura's Sakura. She's just possessed by the shadow, and she'll quickly...."
"She'll quickly be back to normal?
 I explained that to you before. The only way to return her to normal is to separate her from the shadow."

"There are two ways to do so.
 Eliminate the main body of the shadow, or wait until Matou Sakura materializes it.
 You have no way to defeat the shadow right now. All you can do is protect Sakura's mind until the shadow is born."


But I don't know how to protect her mind.
...The Command Spell covering Sakura's body...
If that's what Kotomine means by Black Sakura, then isn't Sakura slowly turning into the shadow?

"...Kotomine. When you talk about materializing the shadow, do you mean Sakura turning into it?"
"No. I'm sure there is some sympathy, but the main body of the shadow is in the Holy Grail.
 What is transforming Matou Sakura is inside the Holy Grail, but that is still her shadow.
 It cannot exist without her. The main body does not have form, so it exists in the material world by being her shadow."

"What's inside the Holy Grail will not come into this world unless there is an incomplete Holy Grail called Matou Sakura.
 But once it is born, it will be a separate entity. Once it is separated from her, the curse tainting her should stop."

"...Kotomine. You say born, but is that thing inside Sakura?"
"Of course not. If it were, the matter would be easily solved. We would simply need to extract it from her body.
 The main body of the shadow is within the Holy Grail. Matou Sakura is merely a host that gives it energy and form."

"But Sakura's the Holy Grail, right? What does that mean?
 Are there many Holy Grails?"

"Yes. I explained to you in the beginning. This land has a Holy Grail, and they summon the Holy Grail into the Holy Grail the people prepared.
 The main Holy Grailthe magic circle and the brain that governs the rules of the ritual called the Holy Grail War. That is the Holy Grail on this land that Einzbern, Tohsaka, and Makiri prepared."

"The Holy Grail in this land"
All the laws... Summoning the Servants, making the Masters fight, and calling down the Holy Grail.
If the Holy Grail War is man-induced, then it's obvious that there's also a man-induced cause.

Thenif I find that large-scale magic circle and destroy it, I may be able to purge the shadow invading Sakura's body

"Do you know where that is, Kotomine?"
"I have a guess. Ask Rin if you would like to know the entrance.
 The Tohsaka family are the supervisors of this land.
 The Einzbern cooperated with them two hundred years ago to secure a land for the ritual. Rin, the successor, should know where the place is."

"Butthat is all after we save Ilyasviel. If Zouken obtains Ilyasviel, she and Matou Sakura will be disposed of as the Holy Grail.
 Matou Zouken has no intention of using the main Holy Grail. For him, the two women are enough.
 Your idea of destroying the main Holy Grail is meaningless."

"D-Don't be stupid! I'm not thinking about such a thing!"
"Really? I think it is the most realistic solution for you. It's strange that you wouldn't go through with it."

"Shut up. So why didn't you tell me about it?
 If you'd told me at the beginning, I would...."

"You would have destroyed the magic circle? Nothing would go so smoothly. My goal is the completion of the magic circle, after all. I cannot let you destroy it."

"I told you that we will be enemies after we rescue Ilyasviel. My goal is different from yours.
 I am interested in what comes from Matou Sakurano, what is trying to become her. Unlike Zouken, I have no wish."

"...Don't bullshit me. You're the same as Zouken. You're using Sakura to create something and make it yours."

"Make it mine...? Of course not. I have no interest in it after it is born. In any case, no human will be able to control it.
 What will appear is a phenomenon called hell. If Matou Sakura becomes that, I will die just like everybody else."

"Wha"
What is that?
Then his goal's just...

"Are you insane?
 You want to turn Sakura into such a thing, knowing that you're going to be killed...!?"

"Yes. My role is to bless whatever is born.
 That will not change, no matter what it is or what situation it is in.
 There is a life and a will to be born. I cannot oppose that.
 Emiya. If there is a pure wish in this world, it must be the desire to be born."

"But what's in Sakura is"
"It is not evil.
 Humans can earn happiness just by existing.
 As they grow, they will learn of new happiness, of more advanced and complex pleasures."

"But humans are not happy at the moment of birth.
 An embryo does not have the knowledge to know what happiness is.
 Humans start from zero, learn what is fun, and learn what is right.
 The beginning is at zero.
 There is no good or evil. There is only the fact that it is allowed to exist in this world."


"Good or evil. The person's knowledge will decide that.
 If there is any responsibility, it lies with the environment and the 'self' that raised you.
 There is no crime in receiving birth.
 That is why I will bless even the birth of a devil."

"This is the way I have lived.
 This way of living is mine.
 Even if what Matou Sakura gives birth to is hell, it is hard to change my nature."


...I don't understand.
I know he's serious.
He knows he'll die, but he's still going bless the evil that will be born through Sakura.
...I'll never be able to approve of this man.
But it's true that he's trying to save Ilya and release Sakura from Zouken's control.

"!"
Thoughts that are in conflict.
Lives that cannot coexist.
But we have the same goal right now.

"I can trust you, right?"
"I said we will be cooperating. I will trust you with my back."

A reply without hesitation.
...That's all that's there right now.
I have an ally that's better than anyone.
I'll just think about rescuing Ilya and getting out of this forest safely
AhAh, ahah

The space is filled with black fire.
The luxurious rooms are burned away by meaningless gasping.

   AhAh, ahah

The blazing fire is like a heat haze.
The formerly shapeless shadow breaks through every wall and floor in concert with the host's pain.

   Hauh, ahahh, ah!

The black heat haze dances in tune to the melody.
Each time the figure at its center curls up, claws at her throat, and gasps in agony, the old castle's beauty is disfigured further.
But this is nothing to grieve over.
This desolate winter castle has been forgotten by everyone.
Nobody has lived here or seen it, so it makes no difference even if it's destroyed.

   "Ah...... Ua... ah... aaahh, ah......"

The hall has turned into the shadow's kingdom.
Writhing in agony, the woman in the middle is both its king and its slave.
It has already been a day since she arrived at this castle with Ilyasviel.

Matou Sakura's transfiguration is reaching its final stage.

As she's one with the shadow, having a physical form is torture.
Her mind is being engulfed by pain and the impulse to destroy.
...If that were all, she would be able to bear it.
She's used to physical pain.

Butthe pain of having her existence denied is something she has never experienced.
The shadow should not exist.
This world has no blessings to offer it.

   "Uh...... Ah... ah... ah......!"

She tears at her throat.
She cannot breathe.
The air is poisonous.
Matou Sakura is turning into a deep-sea monster, so being on land is like being in a vacuum.

  "AhAhhh, ahhhh......!!!!"

That's why she dances around like mad.
Her sanity broken, she takes out her anger on everything she sees.
She keeps appealing to the unconcerned world about her pain.
About her misfortune and her pain.

"Well. It is about time. She remained Matou Sakura for longer than I expected, but she will turn into the vessel with one more push."
Two shadows watch the spectacle.
An old magus, Matou Zouken, and his Servant, Assassin.

"...One more push? I am tired of hearing those words. The match is over. I am the only Servant you need. Have her take in the remaining two."
"I know. But she does not try to kill the Servants she has absorbed. I do not know if it is her shallow wit or cowardice. Saber and Berserker are still trapped within her. She should kill them, but she keeps them alive."

"...Interesting. So Saber is not the only one?"
"No. It is probably to keep me in check, but how thoughtless of her. The more Servants she controls, the more magical energy she must draw from the Holy Grail. It is a supply of magical energy the Holy Grail receives from the Great Holy Grail, but magical energy is not the only thing that flows into her.
 She is accelerating her transfiguration by letting the Servants live. Her sanity will be lost and she will turn into an ideal tool even if I do nothing."

The old magus laughs, watching the girl's suffering.
There's affection in his eyes.
He loves her.
What he originally considered a mere experiment grew beyond his expectation to grant him his dearest wish, immortality.

It would be strange not to love her.
To the old magus, Matou Sakura looks like a beautiful bride.
No matter how much she fights, she will be his in the end.
It doesn't matter even if she obtains power, controls many Servants, and retains her sanity.
Their hierarchy was set eleven years ago.
The old magus can kill Matou Sakura merely by closing his eyes and opening them again.


...But the white skull is different.
He's the symbol of ill omen, the wind that brings death, so he's sensitive to those of his kind.

"The magus makes light of the matter, but"
Will everything turn out well?
The situation will not change, even if the girl loses her sanity.
She reacts to people with hostility.

In that regard, she's already acting the way she will once her mind is lost.
Matou Zouken is conceited.
Even if she goes mad, she will not obey his command.

"......Magus. There is a way to control her, yes? Her defensive instincts are excessive. Your voice will not reach her if she loses her sanity and can no longer tell ally from enemy.
 If that happens, you cannot approach merely by hiding your hostility.
 She is the kind that will eliminate her enemies by foreseeing the 'result' called her death."

"Oh, I see, that is promising. That makes it even better as the container."
The old magus laughs.


Falling silent, the masked figure stares at the crumbling hall.
...He cannot approve of the magus's plan.
He says his goal is immortality, but his method seems distorted.
No, he's a rotting human from the start.
It's natural that he's crazy, but the old man's procedure seems inconsistent

"Haha, did you hear that, Assassin!? She's begging me for help now! Good, good! It feels like we're eleven years in the past!
 The pressure of being denied by the world itself must surely be painful, Sakura!
 But endure it. Your body can endure it. Remember all the days of pain and solitude over the last eleven years!
 For what did you bear the thousands of tortures!?  What did you give your body to the tens of thousands of worms for!? That's right; pain of that degree is nothing to you! That's how I raised you! That's how I trained you!"

"........."
It seems the old magus can hear the girl's voice.
Assassin can only hear groans, but she must literally be begging for her life, begging for help.

"Yes, I will help you! You are my masterpiece! I shall see it through! But I can only save your body. Your mind did not follow me through the eleven years of training.
 You escaped the pain by accepting it, so you should not be able to bear that resentment. But you can rest assured, as I will guarantee the strength of your flesh! You can bear it! Your flesh shall put on Avenger!"

The old magus continues to laugh.
Assassin looks at him emotionlessly and steps back.

"Hm? Where are you going, Assassin?
 There is a slight possibility of danger. I need you here to protect me from her."
"...I do not mind, but why are you concerned about the black Holy Grail and not the white? Why are you letting the legitimate Holy Grail we obtained roam freely?"
"Oh, that. Ilyasviel is cooperative. She exists only to open the gate, as is her duty. She does not mind what we do as long as her goal is achieved."

"........."
"Do not be so doubtful. The Holy Grail you desire is that girl. Keeping your name in history and becoming the original. Your wish to be eternal through record will be granted by Einzbern.
 But I need her to keep her original form. Homunculi are outside my expertise. You can let her be until they prepare her formal dress."

".........So you will not force them, you say?
 Butdo we have such liberty?"
"Of course we do. We have no more enemies.
 It was unexpected that Emiya's boy and Tohsaka's girl were alive, but they aren't important. Nobody is foolish enough to fight after being shown that much difference in power."

"We cannot take it back if we rush things out of needless worry and allow Ilyasviel to die.
 It is her role to open heaven's gate. We shall show compassion and let her carry out her dutyAssassin?"
"Stop. It seems there is someone that foolish."
"Hm?"

At that instant, the white skull disappears.
Assassin sensed the intruders and hurried out of the castle without hesitation.
The enemies are already running outside.
They have slipped through the unwary magus's guard and are about to exit the castle gate.

"Oh. So you are determined to die, boy?"
But he hasn't been careless.
Ilyasviel cannot run away.
Einzbern's longstanding desire is in her core.
The white girl will help him even if he doesn't force her.
It's foolish to run away with such a girl.
Even if they escape the forest with her, she will come to the land of the Holy Grail, the land of the origin.

"Hah. I have left her alone, but it cannot be helped now.
 It is your turn, Sakura. You cannot be saved without Ilyasviel. If you would like to be freed from that pain, go trample upon them without mercy."
With a loud laugh, the presence of the old magus recedes.

...A shadow is cowering in the hall.
The shadow that shrouds the entire hall has become a black swamp, from which two dark figures emerge.

   "....................."

The girl no longer feels agony.
It's not that she's accustomed to the poison now.
It's merely that...
"............I see. You came, Senpai......"

...Pleasure has surpassed her dark pain.

"...So that priest's with him. How stupid of him. He came to be eaten?"
She raises a finger.
To the direction of the castle gate. The direction the trespassers have gone, where they are running even now.

"Go. You can kill anyone but Senpai. Kill anyone else, no matter who they may be."

The black giant is released.
The unleashed hound roars and disappears with a sudden gust.

"But thenyou won't be able to tell who that is, though, Berserker."

She smiles.
Slowly, she leaves the kingdom of rubble with the black swordsman.
We go out into the yard.
The whole world is covered by the shadow.
My entire body is numb with fear.

...The black shadow is standing in front of us.
It can crush this house if it wants to.
The difference in our power is obvious.
It has transfigured to an existence that's unlike anything I've ever seen.

"..............."
...The black shadow does nothing.
It's not Sakura, but a shadow shaped like her.
The real Sakura is under the Ryudou Temple.
The thing in front of us is a virtual image.

"Hmph. So you're sending the shadow instead of showing up yourself? You've gotten arrogant during the short time you've been away."
"........."
Does she not hear Tohsaka's provocation, or does she not hear anything at all?
Wavering in the moonlight, her shadow looks lonely.

"........."
Her eyes look at me.
'Senpai'.
Weak, as if she'll reply like always if I just reach out.


But I don't.
What I must do is determined.
I can't say anything to her, as doing so would weaken my resolve.

She looks away.
After hanging her head for a moment, "Did you hear the whole story from Ilyasviel, Nee-san?"
She confronts Tohsaka with a cold voice.

"Yeah. I heard about what's possessing you and the abilities of what's about to be born from the Holy Grail.
So, Sakura. Let me ask. Do you have any intention of cutting ties with Angra Manyu?"
Tohsaka's voice is the same.
Completely cold, showing no concern for Sakura.

"No. I said the weak me disappeared, didn't I? I was able to obtain this power, so I don't intend to let it go.  I couldn't even if I wanted to.
 ...This is how Matou Sakura has to live from now on."

"I see. Then one more thing.
 How complete is the Servant you're boasting about? Ilya said it's coming out soon, but what do you have to say as the mother? Is it already born?"

"...Of course not. When that happens, this town will be consumed in a second.
 I can't allow that yet. Senpai's still here.
 So I won't let him out as long as I still exist."

"Oh, so there's no reason for us to hurry, huh? So you're going to keep Angra Manyu inside as long as Shirou's with me?
 That's good, Shirou. Sakura seems well enough."

"...Don't be ridiculous. You should know how much longer I'm going to last.
 Please run away with Senpai. I won't last long. I don't know when I'll disappear. I might only be able to hold out for one night."

"So I'm warning you before that.
 ...Nee-san. Please take Senpai and run far away. Then I can be at peace and take his life with mine."

Sakura says she's going to kill him using her life.
Tohsaka trembles a bit.
Is that because she believes her, or...

"...Humph. You don't know when you're going to disappear, huh?
 You're wrong. You just don't know when you'll run out of patience."
"Nee-san."

"Oh well. I don't know how you're going to kill Angra Manyu, but you can kill yourself without hesitation if I run away with Shirou?
 You'll kill the Servant within the Holy Grail along with you, right?"

"...Y-Yes. So please run away.
 I-I don't want you to see me change. It's fine as long as Senpai gets away.
 Soplease don't come after me anymore, Senpai."

She's desperately begging us.
Sakura's shadow can kill us right now, but it asks for salvation by letting us go.


But I can't answer her wish.
I can't leave Sakura and run away, nor can I let her kill herself along with Angra Manyu.
And...
"We'll go there. We'll go and kill you for sure."
Tohsaka breaks away from her sister.

"Wha"
"What did you expect? As Tohsaka's magus, I can't ignore you. And I can't believe you even if you say you'll kill yourself.
 Don't you get it, Sakura? You're not making any sense. You want to kill, but you're telling me to run.
 Geez, you're trying to act like a good girl because you're in front of Shirou."

"...What?"
"Oh, you can make a good face. That's what you should've done from the start.
 So, is that all? Then get lost. You don't have to hurry since we'll go see you right away.
 Look, Sakura. I'll kill you with my own hands."

Tohsaka declares with voice that even contains kindness.
...The shadow wavers.
After freezing on the spot like a statue...
"YesI'll be waiting for you, Nee-san."
...It smiles violently and disappears.

The shadow covering the house recedes.
Tohsaka and I are the only ones remaining in the yard.

I get dizzy.
I thought I was concentrating, but it seems I was agitated after seeing Sakura's image.
...It seems Sakura's not the only one that's running out of time.

"Shirou.
 You heard what Sakura said. But what're you going to do?
 If you want to run, I won't stop you. But if you do, that'll be after you project the gem sword."

"You don't have to confirm with me. I won't run away, and I'll somehow project the gem sword.
 We're cooperating, right? Then I'll follow up by doing things you can't do."

"...I see. That's good, but do you understand, Shirou?
 Coming with me means killing Sakura. The same goes for the gem sword. You're going to prepare a weapon that I will use to kill her."

"...Yeah. The gem sword thing is contradictory. But Sakura's out of our control, and projecting the sword is a promise we made. If projecting the sword means we can match Sakura's shadow, then it's something we definitely need to do."

"Oh. So..."
"Yeah, I'm taking the opposite measure. I'm going to end this war by saving Sakura. I've decided to be Sakura's ally."

"Even if letting Sakura live means killing everyone else?"
"We don't know that yet. There should be a way to save Sakura and not let there be any more victims."

"...I don't know about that. Sakura's already killed many people. Is it justice for you to save such a person, Shirou?"
Her inquiry is decisive.
A sin I can't talk myself out of.
She puts it into words, and I finally...

"That's right. I'll protect her even if she's not human. I'm going to protect her from everything, including the part of her that wants to kill me.
 That's all I want to do. That's what it means to be someone's ally, right?"
...I'm able to tell her what I think.

"......Geez. You really can just come out and say it."
I nod back, feeling no shame.

"......I see. Well, I knew there was no point in arguing with you, but I didn't think it'd go this far. You beat me."
"Huh? Where are you going, Tohsaka?"

"I have to go prepare for the battle.
 Sakura gave us that warning because she really doesn't have time to spare. So I have to get ready quickly."
"That's true, but we were talking"

"We're done talking now. In short, you're going to save Sakura as long as you're still alive, right?
 ...Hmph. Fine, do as you want. I'm not going to say anything now. Go struggle to your heart's content."

"Hm...?"
Where did her nervousness go? Tohsaka looks angry now.

"But don't get me wrong. This is in exchange for making the gem sword.
 I'll leave you in charge of Sakura as long as you're trying. I won't do anything until you can't move anymore.
 ...That's good, right? You might be able to save Sakura, if you try hard enough."

Tohsaka leaves with that.
"........."
The uneasiness in my chest goes away.
We're thinking oppositely.
But Tohsaka still wants to save Sakura.

Then I can entrust her with Sakura.
We both like her.
Then Tohsaka should be able to save Sakura.
It's ten o'clock.
Tohsaka said we'll prepare for battle and go to the Ryudou Temple before the date changes.

"Well. I'm going to have you project the gem sword, but how do you feel? Can you project it while suppressing Archer's arm?"
"Oh"
...I see.
Ilya hasn't told her how I took the Shroud off.
"Wellum, yeah..."

"Oh, that's good to hear. Then the rest is up to Shirou and Ilya.
 The Azoth Sword, which is as close as we're going to get to the gem sword, Shirou's projection, and Ilya's support. We may not be able to replicate it, but if all goes well, we should at least be able to reproduce half of its original ability."
Tohsaka hands me a dagger.

"........."
The dagger is a ritualistic equipment.
It might be something she favors, as it looks well-used.
Not only that. Even an amateur like me can feel how much magical energy is stored in this thing.

...Well, this is nothing compared to the shadow, but it's still a hundred times more than my magical energy capacity.

"...This is amazing. You had something like this up your sleeve?"
"Of course it's amazing. I used all the jewels I had, which contained ten years worth of magical energy."

Tohsaka sulks, like she didn't want to use them.
...She seems generous, but maybe she's really stingy when it comes to money.
Well, with that aside...

"Hmm, but is that really okay, Tohsaka? You don't have any left for yourself if you've used everything you have, right? I know you're still not fully recovered, so can you still fight?"

"Well, I can manage to move around. But I haven't healed to the point where I can use magic again."
"Waitthen..."

"You don't need to worry. It's fine as long as you can project the gem sword. The sword has absurd powers said to have even stopped the 'falling moon'."

"...?"
I don't get what she means, but Tohsaka has great confidence.
...Well, if she's so sure of herself, I won't worry either.

"Let's start, Shirou. It'll take a long time to project that sword, even for you. We have to get started or the date'll change."

"You're right. Then let's go back to your room. If we're not someplace where you can relax, our chances are lower."
Tohsaka heads back to the living room.

"Oh, hold on. I'll do the projection in the shed.
 And I want to be alone with Ilya while I do it, so can you wait in your room?"
"Why? I have to be there in case something happens, right?"

"There's no need. It's a bother if you're here.
 Shirou gets distracted easily, so we might fail if you fall and get his attention when it counts the most."

"...Hey, that's rude, Ilya."
Tohsaka complains with a sour look.
She's not arguing back, maybe because she can't deny the possibility that she'll screw up at a crucial moment.

"...All right. Then I'll wait outside the shed. Is that all right, Ilya?"
"...I guess it can't be helped. That's the biggest compromise we can make."

"Rin. Don't come in until I tell you to if you want us to reproduce the gem sword. I'll call for you if something's about to happen, so please stay outside until then no matter what."

"You're being persistent. I said I understand. I won't come in even if I hear Shirou scream."
"........."
It doesn't really matter, but I wish she'd picked a better example.

"Well, let's go, Shirou."
Ilya goes into the shed.
I decide to ask Tohsaka something before I follow.

"Tohsaka. Can I have this sword?"
"...? You're going to be projecting using that. The Azoth Sword will go away once the gem sword's projected."

"Yeah. You can have the gem sword, so can I have this in return?
 See, this might break if I fail. I can't concentrate, thinking how you might get angry if I break this."

"...Geez. Fine. You can have the Azoth Sword if that'll help you relax."
"Thanks. Then I'm going to go do my best."

...I shut the door.
I can't let Tohsaka see this.
I'm sure she won't stop me now, but she'll definitely feel responsible.
If I'm to smooth this out, I have to tell her I used it after everything is over and get retroactive approval.

"...Are you ready, Shirou? You've released Archer's arm already, so I don't need to explain the steps, right?"
I nod.
Ilya tells me to sit down, and I do so.

"But Ilya. I can only project what I've seen or what Archer made. I have no information on the gem sword. I can't project it even if we have a blueprint and a dagger that's just like it."

"I know. I'll first have you come inside my memory. I haven't seen it either, but the record of the gem sword is in me.
 Tohsaka's great master was there when the Great Holy Grail was made.
 I'm sure the sword was there at that time."

"Whoa, Ilya"
"Just close your eyes. I'll keep your body here and send your mind somewhere else. We did this before. I'll send your vision into my memory, so analyze the gem sword there.
 ...I'll release your left arm once you're inside. You'll be hit by the pressure of two hundred years and the invasion from your arm at the same time. Brace yourself and try to finish the projection as fast as you can."


Ilya's voice is trembling.
...Her arms are as well.

"...I'll take you to the gem sword, so you just need to hold your breath. Clear your mind and don't look at anything unnecessary. You just need to draw out his Zelretch"

Space splits.
Is it because all my senses are within her memory...
or is it because my left arm is released?

There's no pain, the cognition of pain doesn't matter now, I'm swallowed by my injury, I'm falling into a swirling maelstrom of pain.

I don't know where I am.

       I don't know who I am.

          I don't know what it means.

It's a large circuit.
Multi-layered Crests are carved on a bare rock that's over fifty meters in radius.
It's like a large observatory, rotating by itself in the deserts of Arizona.

The circuits cover the area in many layers.
The geometric figures turn in place.
A white girl stands in the center of the beautiful spider's nest.

Her name is Lizleihi.
Lizleihi Justizia von Einzbern.
She's the magus that devised the Holy Grail War.
The great magus who was called the winter saint. A magus accompanied by Makiri Zouken and Tohsaka Nagato.

The Great Holy Grail is activated.
Justizia becomes the key reenacting the ancient sorcery.
Yes. The Holy Grail is just a Holy Grail without her.
Her will is needed for Heavens Feel.
The old man knows as well as Makiri and Tohsaka do that the Holy Grail is a mere wishbringer.

My vision narrows.
The world expands.
I concentrated on something needless. I did, so my body was ripped in half.

The world is too big for this small body.
I'll eventually see nothing.
The process behind this two-hundred-year-old ritual doesn't matter.
There's only one thing I need to look at.
I concentrate on the man standing in front of the Great Holy Grail. I concentrate on the dagger in his hand

That's the original.
A ritual dagger with a jeweled blade.
The kaleidoscopic gleam sears through my eyes and into my brain.

", "

I understand the instant I see it.
I understand that I can't comprehend it.
All I can imitate is its shape.
I can't analyze its structure and project it.

What kind of a magical theory was it constructed with?
The old man's dagger is still a mystery, even if I use Archer's arm and every last piece of knowledge in heroic spirit Emiya.
It's alien technology.
The old man is embodying general knowledge from a far future, beyond the reach of modern man

". ......!!"

I'm repelled.
I can't be repelled.
I can't reach it.
Not reaching it is unforgivable.

I reach out.
I reach out.
I reach out.
My eyes are burned out, my brains are burned out.
I extend my left arm for dozens of meters, extend, extend, extend

"Stop! Come back, Shirou...!"

I hear Ilya's voice.
But I'm not there yet.
I don't even have my fingertips on it.
I can't back out now.
How can I back out after seeing that miracle, the ultimate one...!?

"Give up...! Do you want to disappear, Shirou!?"

Get there

Get there

Get there

Get there



"Haa, ah.......!!!!!!!!"
"Shirou!"
Did I jump myself, or was I pushed back by something?
I'm flying, and I land on my back.

"Haga, ah!"
My left arm      pain              .
My tongue       my fingers             the trembling won't                   .
"Ahuwa, ah, ah!"
                             .
                   ,               .

"Stay     ! I'll         Shroud          !"
"Haa, guh, ah..........!"
A big knife stabs me from the side.
It's so uncomfortable that I repel the one wielding it

"Oh... Ouch"
And I realize I just punched Ilya.
"......! I-I'm sorry, Ilya, I"
She pats dust off herself and gets up.
...Good. She's not hurt.

"I told you not to look at unnecessary things, you idiot!
 ...Geez, I'll let you off the hook this time since it paid off, but I won't forgive you if you disobey me again!"

She points at my face as she scolds me.
...Wait.
Feeling something hard in my left hand, I look down.


......I managed to project it.
It's projected, but it doesn't seem like the one I saw.
First of all, I don't feel any magical energy in this thing.
Tohsaka's Azoth Sword is many times better than this, and this blade wouldn't cut paper.

"Yup. I have a lot to complain about, but thanks for your hard work, Shirou. Your projection was perfect. You showed me a flawless blade works."
"UhI don't know, but is this any good? It looks pretty crappy."

"That's fine as is. The sword is an extraordinary demonic sword that can only be used by Schweinorg's lineage.
 Well, I guess it's fate. Sakura is receiving the protection of the third and Rin's going to try to use the second. It wouldn't end up as mere investigation if the Association were here. Every department would be running to put them on trial."
Ilya laughs.

"...Wow. So this dagger is that amazing?"
"Yeah. To be more accurate, it's a multi-dimensional refractory phenomenon, Gem Sword Kishua Zelretch Schweinorg.
 It's called Gem Sword Zelretch, and it's the old magus's favored sword and Tohsaka's heirloom."

"But the sword wasn't passed down the Tohsaka line, just the blueprint.
 It's an assignment from the sorcerer that the Tohsaka magi must pursue for a long, long time."

"Assignment from a sorcerer... Wait, the great master Tohsaka was talking about is a sorcerer...!?"

"Yeah. But Zelretch is an oddball among the sorcerers in that he still associates himself with this world, so I'm sure he has other apprentices.
 I don't think Zelretch is in this world, but he might show up once Rin's capable of making the gem sword by herself."

"Hmm......?"
He's not in this world, but might appear all of a sudden? Isn't he just a wanderer that likes to travel?


Whoa.
I let my guard down.
I get dizzy.
I clench my right fist, feel the pendant digging into my torn flesh, and keep my consciousness.

", "
I steady my breathing so Ilya doesn't notice.
My limbsI still feel my limbs.


......Good.
I thought I'd lose something if I used projection, but I'm not missing anything yet.
My head's still working.
The biggest proof is that I can check on my condition.
I should be able to use one more projection.

No, I have to use it.
I have to save Sakura in a way different from Tohsaka.
Archer's arm will make it poss-

"So             means. In short, the sorcery                parallel worlds. So his nickname            Kaleidoscope             "
"Tohsaka?"
"   ?      ,                   ?"


I can't understand her.
It's not that I can't hear her. She's just speaking in a language I don't understand.
She's talking in some strange language and holding something dangerous in her left hand.

...Tohsaka's holding a sword I've never seen before.
Never seen before?
That can't be.
I projected (I think) that sword just now, and my left hand is empty, so it must mean I handed it to Tohsaka.

"Shirou?        from            .
 Was the projection               ?"


I get a chill.
My memory's vague.
I can't recall anything.
My understanding and the details don't match up.

"Guh, ..........!"
I clench my right hand.
My eyes finally focus in exchange for dripping blood.

"Um, Tohsaka."
I get up.
My limbs are light compared to my disconnected head.
They're so light that I think they may be empty inside.

"It's not 'Tohsaka'. Ilya and I will go test it out, so you should restwait, what's with your hand...!"

Tohsaka grabs me.
Her speed is surprisingly slow, but...
"Eh......? Why do you have this...?"
My mind isn't working, and she has ahold of my hand before I know it.

Tohsaka's looking at the pendant in my palm with astonishment.
I don't know why she's surprised.
But I have this because...

"Shirou. Why do you have this? And are you crazy, holding it this tight?"
"Why? I just have it as a charm. This is..."

...Something I picked up.
Why did I pick it up?
It's something I shouldn't forget, but I can't remember.
But the stranger in my left arm knows what it is better than I do.

"......Um, it's something important. I have to have it on me until the end."

Words that are not mine come out of my mouth.
".........
 Shirou. I also have that pendant."

"Eh?"
Tohsaka takes out a pendant from her pocket.
It's certainly the same.
It's a simple design for a jewel user like Tohsaka, but I think something simple like this brings out her beauty.

"Wow, they're the same."
I nod back.

"No. Mine's empty, but there's still a bit left in yours. It's not significant, but I'm sure there's a meaning behind the usage of it."
"...?"

"Keep that. It might come in handy."
Tohsaka puts her pendant away and walks off with Ilya.

"Hey, Tohsaka. Where are you going?"
"I need to talk to Ilya. I'll let you rest for an hour, so stay in your room.
 And I'll get seriously mad if you don't treat your hand right away."


Tohsaka's bad temper borders on outright hostility.
She takes Ilya, who follows her without a word.
The clock strikes midnight.
It's twelve o'clock, the promised time.

I wrap the Azoth sword with cloth and tuck it under my arm.
This is my only weapon. The only other thing I'm taking is the pendant.

"Shirou, Rin's calling for you. She's waiting outside, so she wants to meet up there as soon as you're ready."
Ilya's going to stay here.
It's partly because Zouken's after her, but I'm also having her stay here because she's my hope.

"I see. So she's out there, huh?"
"Yeah. She looked like she wanted you to come quickly, so she'll probably scold you again if you don't hurry."


I nod and get up.
There's no pain in my left arm now.
It's just that my human functionality is eroding.

I can't tell what I'm doing if I stand still.

"Then I'm going. Be careful, Ilya."
"See you, Shirou. Please come home with Sakura and Rin before the day breaks."
I wave goodbye to her and leave.

The house is dead quiet.
Ten years.
Many things happened here, and I have a lot of memories.
This just happened recently.
A morning scene that was part of my life for a year and a half.

The shed is dead quiet.
It's my small workshop that I frequented like my room.
Here I trained hard every night, hoping to be like Kiritsugu.
She'd wake me up from time to time when I slept in.
It feels like it happened long ago, but I even remember how the air smelled.

The room is dead quiet.
A room that was only used for the past couple days.
I don't have many memories here.
Only Sakura comes to mind.

"Man."
I sigh and lean against the wall.
I can't remember.
I can't remember what happened in this house or all the things I did.
But still.
Sakura's face comes to my mind just by walking to these places.

"Wow. I..."
...She really means a lot to me.
My consciousness is fading, and my memory is a mess.
The ten years in this house are ambiguous in my head.

ButI can still remember.
I can clearly remember Sakura, no matter what part of me goes away.


I take a deep breath.
What must be done has been determined from the start.

"All rightlet's go, Sakura."
Taking a firm grip on my consciousness, I leave Sakura's room.

There's nothing left.
We once made a promise here.
We knew it wouldn't come true, but we encouraged each other.

I'll do it again now.
What was that small hope used for?
You...

COWARD!!!!!
Rejected! Quickly go back to the previous choice and redo it!
I never raised you to be such a coward!

That's right!
Quickly come rescue me!

Exactly! The main story's reaching its final stage.  Nonstop development awaits you.

There are only four more Tiger Dojos.
If you came this far, run to the ending without dying.

Osu, you are exactly right!
I feel a bit lonely, but you won't make it ahead unless you're that determined!

Yes, well said, pupil number one!
Well, I wish you luck!
Oh, he died.

Osu. Excessive bleeding and falling to his death. There's no hope of survival.

I don't think I even need to say it, but the cause of this death is because you went against them by yourself.

If there's a chance to join hands with someone, go ahead and do it for a better result.

What? Then it's also good to join hands with people like Caster and Shinji?

Hm. No, consider their personalities.
First of all, you don't even get those choices.

What a failure. I wanted to see a route where Shirou and Shinji cooperate, or where you join hands with Caster.

Kiii! Don't talk about the rejected routes! Time and resources aren't infinite!

It's the spirit of the cook to put the most effort into the tastiest part!

Okay, I'll leave it at that.
So, you just have to join hands with Kotomine?

...Hmm, I guess so.
I understand not wanting to cooperate with that priest, but throw away your personal feelings and fight together.

Osu, I understand!
Yesterday's foe is today's friend! It's a common turn of events in a manga!

Yup! Everyone's part of the family! It's a good phrase! Use it!

That's right! Take full advantage of him and throw him away once you're done!

Hey there, don't talk too honestly.
This is one end. You've fought well. *Sob*

Huh? Aren't you going to get mad like always and call him a wimp?

This end is peaceful in a way.
It's like Saber-chan's end in "Heavens Feel".

Oh. ...Well, Shirou did win against Saber in a one-on-one fight, so I guess he's satisfied.

Yup.
But we'll carry out this dojo like always.
So, why did we reach this end, pupil number one!?

It's simple! I think it's because you fought Saber one-on-one! Osu!

That's right! I tell you every time to prepare a trump card when going into the final battle, so why don't you do your best!?

Master, then what's the trump card this time?

An ally!

Anally? That sounds really funny, master!

Stop with the jokes!

To be frank, you need a partner!
Even in this situation, there should be one Servant who might cooperate with you!

Convince her somehow before you go into your final battle!

Okay... But master, she quickly runs away.

Recall the conversation you had with her before. There's only one answer. She'll become your ally if you give her the answer she wants.

Well, this dojo is over.

The long battle is about to reach the grand finale!
Please check out the grand finale of "Fate/stay night" with your own eyes!

Bye! Let's meet again in some other Tiger Dojo!

It's an altar enshrining the stars.

The fire blazes up as if to connect the heaven and the earth.
The flickering fire illuminates the dark cave, and singes the surrounding dome.
But this can't be a proper enshrinement.
It's said to connect to the sky, but the heavens are still underground.
And the shining light isn't red, but black.
The air's impure, the wind's stagnant, and the drops of water on the walls are colored like poison.

The underground kingdom that's said to be the dragon's lair actually looks like the dragon's stomach.
No human would come here.
The only ones to come and honor this alien world are serpents fleeing from the light.

"Guh"
A white skull coughs in this alien world.
The one tinted by dark red light is the one who lost his Master, the Servant Assassin.

"This is the end. I cannot maintain my body without a supply of magical energy."
The white skull creeps across the wall.
A girl stands before him.
Swathed in a black curse, she blankly stares at the oncoming figure.

"I finally made it.
 Magus. I cannot see you, but are you still alive?"
He stops five meters in front of the girl.
Sticking to the wall like a spider, Assassin speaks into empty space.

"Yes. Glad you could make it back, Assassin."
And the call reaches him.
The voice of the old magus echoes through the empty chamber.
The old man who was killed by Kotomine Kirei still lives in this underground kingdom.

It's natural.
The one killed in the forest was just a collection of worms.
The main body of the old magus, the host that contains his soul, is sleeping in the safest place on earth.
Even the priest's holy words cannot kill him unless the main body is destroyed.

"But having my limbs destroyed got me. I cannot make magical energy to send to you. And it is too much of a bother to go find a new body above ground.
 ...Hm, this will burden her, but it is about time. Sakura, make a contract with Assassin. You need a new bodyguard now that Berserker is defeated."

The voice echoes.
The girl clad in black curseMatou Sakura doesn't answer.
Ignoring the one who has absolute control over her, she looks off blankly into space.

"...What are you doing, Sakura? Are you disobeying me?"
The irritated voice also contains danger.
The old man is irritated.
He's angry that she lost Ilyasviel and Berserker.

"Sakura. I will ask you one more time. Are you going to defy me?"
Cold scorn.
The girl has never disobeyed this voice.
It's not fear, but submission to his absolute controlling power.
The girl does fear the old man.
Moreover, the girl cannot disobey him.
Because her heart is...

"Hold, magus. Perhaps there is no intelligence left in her. She has such a great power within her; it's not something a weak girl can withstand."
"Hm?"
His irritation disappears.
...A gentle silence.
The sounds of worms crawling fills the hell lit by black flame.

"Hm. It seems that way. I thought she would last a while, but the end came rather quickly."
The old magus sounds disappointed, yet happy.
The girl doesn't answer.
Her mind has been swallowed by darkness.

"Thenyou will take the girl as planned?"
"Do not put it like that. It is not as planned. It cannot be helped. Matou Sakura's mind disappeared. So there is nothing left that can control the monster.
 So although I know it is brutal, I must take over my empty granddaughter."
A laugh.
Coming from the girl's throat.
Rising from her throat... is the old man's laughter.

"Then please hurry. My body is disappearing. I will disappear unless I am quickly supplied with magical energy."
"Very well. I shall start.
 ...My, this is disappointing, Sakura. You raised it to that degree. I wanted to give you the glory of obtaining the Holy Grail, but it cannot be helped.
 If you must curse someone, curse yourself. The ritual did not succeed in time because you let Ilyasviel go."

A gritting sound.
A worm squirms to swap her head.
It isn't visible.
There are no worms on the girl's body.
It's not on the outside...
It's a distorted thought that creeps up from her heart.

Worm-user, Matou Zouken.
His main body, the host of his rotting soul, is a false nerve hidden within Matou Sakura's heart.

"Hah, her body hasn't changed yet, but I am not one to complain. I shall now take your flesh as my own.
 Farewell, Sakura. You've endured more than I expected from an experiment. You have done well to please me...!"
A sound of writhing blood vessels.
Matou Zouken's spirit orders his main body to eat the girl's brain.

But.

"There's no need for that, Grandfather. I'm fine."

The girl puts her hand on her chest and wakes up.

"Oh. I thought it had consumed you, but you still persist? ......Hm. Sakura. The circumstances have changed, and I can no longer maintain Assassin.
 It will burden you, but form a contract with him."
The old magus gives her an order.
But the girl shakes her head in refusal.

"What? What do you mean?"
"I told you already, Grandfather. There's no need for that."
An ice-cold voice.
At that instant.
A vast darkness swallows the white skull on the wall.

"Gi!?"
"Wha!?"
The surprise comes too late.
The assassin's body is compressed in an instant, his mask the only part not crushed.
"Gahah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!?"
The mask falls.
Under the white skull...
The face that should be there is a skull, just like the mask.

"......Fufu. Oh, I wondered what sort of face you had, but you had none to begin with.
 You didn't hide your face, but wore the mask to make people think a face lay beneath it. Such a disappointment."
"GiGirl, you"
"You lost your face and name, but you still wanted eternity? ...But how unfortunate. If you seek eternity, you should've sought to live forever like my grandfather.
 The Holy Grail can't go back into the past and regain your name."

"Disappear, old man of the mountain. You're nothing but an assassin. You can't become the one and only Hassan."
"Gi, giaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Even his death cry is swallowed by the shadow.
The white skulled assassin is swallowed by the girl's shadow.

"Guhare you insane!? What are you doing, fool...!?"
His panic is akin to fury.
Is he surprised, oris he frightened?

In response to the old man's scream, the girl smiles.
"He attacked Senpai twice.
 That's why I killed him. I'm the only one allowed to hurt him."
"Wha"
"And Grandfather. You don't need to be protected by him anymore. So we have to give him leave."

And then...
She sticks her finger into her heart and pulls out a worm that was deep within her nerves.

"!!!!"
How do you describe the fear, the terror?
She gouged her heart and tore her nerves, but still smiles.

"WWhat, what are you doing, Sakura"
The worm wriggles.
The girl stares with empty eyes at her grandfather, what used to be her grandfather, what seems to have been her grandfather.

"Oh. It was easier than I expected. I thought you would be bigger."
No. Actually, Matou Zouken's true body wasn't this small.
The old magus switched his main body when he planted himself in her heart.
To inhabit her heart, he had to be smaller than a heart.
In retrospect, his strange preference was his downfall.

"SakuraSakura, don't tell me..."
"I should thank the priest. I would've been swallowed if he hadn't eliminated you."

She sees through his plan.
No, this outcome was inevitable.
The old magus didn't even try to hide his intentions, and the girl didn't disobey him.
So there was no problem.
She was just a piece of flesh that the old magus would eventually take over.
Until she betrayed him.

"HHold on, hold on, hold on, hold on...!!
 No, no, Sakura...! Possessing you is my last resort. I shall entrust you with the gate as long as you are still conscious. All I want is for the Matou bloodline to prosper.
 All I want is for you to win and obtain everything...!"

The worm squirms around.
The girl smiles at the trash in her fingers.

"All the better, then. I don't need your help anymore. I can open the gate by myself."

The impossible occurs.
The old magus only made one mistake.

"! Wait, wait, please, Sakura...!
 This has all been for you...!
 And this is how you repay me"

"Goodbye, Grandfather.
 It must've been tiring to crawl about underground for two hundred years, right?
 You can disappear now."

The old man has raised her too much.
Believing her to be pure, he never noticed the darkness within.

...The girl's the only one left at the altar.
The swaying black fire rejoices at the independence of the girl that embodies it.

"Fuh."
The girl stares at the blood on her hand, "FufuFufu, ahahahahahahaha"
And laughs like an empty puppet.
Two black figures crash against one another.
One is Rider, running at great speed, striking at her enemy from all possible directions.
Her long hair blown behind her, she looks like a beautiful shooting star.

But.
A shooting star is a small star, after all.
The swordsman who Rider faces.
Rider cannot break through Saber's guard, as she firmly fixes herself on the ground and overwhelms Rider.

No matter how quickly Rider leaps to attack her blind spots, Saber deflects the daggers with a single swing of her blade, striking Rider in the same motion.
Her severe firmness reminds me of a black sun.
A large star that will consume you once you draw near.
No matter how fast Rider may move, an ephemeral shooting star can never match the light of one that burns in place.

"Haah"
Her sneak attack is repelled yet again, and she's wounded.
...She can retreat as Saber counterattacks because of her superhuman speed.
Rider closes in and withdraws in an instant, just like a black spark.
But her efforts merely prevent a fatal blow.

The difference in their powers is obvious.
Rider's speed decreases the more she attacks.
High-speed movement and continuous offense.
Natural healing that regenerates the wounds Saber sustains.
She's not thinking about anything that comes after.
She can't match Saber unless she uses all of her energy.

Rider's blocking Saber's attacks by attacking.
Once Saber shifts to offense, she and her master will be killed instantly.
Therefore, Rider keeps running, knowing she'll eventually burn out.

Her energy's lost with every passing second.
Rider said she could last two minutes.
It's been ten minutes since passing that limit.
Rider's legs are starting to give in to the strain.

In contrast, Saber is unscratched.
Rider's attacks have not reached her, and she shows no fatigue.
Technique, vitality, magical energy.
Saber overwhelms Rider in these three aspects.
Thereforeonce Rider loses her speed, her sole advantage, Saber will shift to offense.

Rider's speed is declining.
...It's only a matter of time before Saber catches up to Rider's speed.
A few more seconds. Rider will be out of breath once her next attack is blocked.
The instant Rider loses her strength and magical energy, Saber will slice her body in half.


But this has been predicted.
Before they came to the cavern.
The boy told Rider of his prediction, of this exact outcome.
She knows she'll lose if she fights like this.

There's only one way to change the outcome of death.
They hold their breath and wait for the moment

Rider attacks Saber.
At the same instant.
I loosen the restraint on my left arm
and
start
the projection.

I'm disappearing.
         Loosening the Shroud on Archer's arm

                           Search.
I'm blown away.
                  The wind's strong.
I'm losing my comprehension of what's before me.

Let go of the right hand.
Put the Shroud back on.
I can't bear it for even a second.
I'll lose everything.
I'll lose what I value.
          Search, select.
No, every part of my body's dying at this moment.

Rider's fighting desperately.
I can't whine about this.
I... have to do... what I can... and fight.
I can't lose my concentration for even a second.
Rider's going to time it.
I have to free my left arm so I can match her timing.

          Select, analyze.

But it hurts.
It's painful and scary.
QuickQuick, is        Rid  .


It disappears.
Something I value disappears.
I can't remember what I lost.
But what I kept in my heart cannot be recalled ever again.

            Defer. Defer. Defer. Defer.

Slash.
My right lung is torn from within.

"Guh"
Not yet?
I can't stay conscious.
Rider's also desperate.
I won't lose.
I give all I have to keep watching Rider.
Rider's fighting her fight.
I'll fight my own fight

"......!"
Rider stops.
Rider must have exhausted her reserves of energy, because she's on her knees in front of Saber.

Saber's sword moves.
Rider's going to be killed.
I...
I can't just abandon Rider.
I bear the pain and the shredding memory.
I pull out the Azoth Sword and run to the black swordsman.

If my determination was quick, my action was quick as well.
My legs are strong as an explosion, and my body's fast as a bullet.

Regurgitation of blood, backflow of my senses, backflow of poison.

My left arm and my body become one.
An inexperienced warrior named Emiya Shirou turns into a supreme superbeing.


A second feels like ten.
I can manage it.
I can match Saber by sacrificing Emiya Shirou.

"Run, Rider!"
I run to the confronting figures and attack from the side.
"......Shirou...!?"
Rider's on the ground.

Saber can only react with her eyes.

I got her.
I take aim at her open side and cut at her left arm with the Azoth Sword.

"Wha"
It breaks.
The sword that should've cut through Saber's arm shatters at the moment of contact.

At the speed of light, the counterattack comes.
An arm flies off.
A severed left arm rolls across the ground, just as I planned.

"......"
Rider jumps back, while Saber just stands there.
"AhAhh, gah......!"
I kneel, trying to staunch the flow of blood from my left shoulder with my remaining hand.

"Ha, guh, guh, ahhhh......!"
I writhe in agony.
"It is not that I could not react. There was no need to react, Shirou."
The black swordsman states without emotion.
She comes near me.
She steps behind my back, and...

"Now you have lost your weapon. ...Sakura does not say it, but she wishes you to live. I am to take you to her if I am able to neutralize you before you die.
 But"

The tip of her sword pricks my spine.
A cold weight of death, able to pierce my heart with one push.

"...Choose. You can die by my sword or receive a death worse than death from Sakura. The decision is yours, Shirou."
...I'm losing consciousness.
My blood's flowing out of me, and a sword is pressed against my back.


...I don't know what I chose.
There's only one thing I'm sure of.
It's that I can't save Sakura no matter what
I pass my limits.
I project a weapon to stop Saber while maintaining the projection for Rider.


I lose my cool.
My thoughts surpass the speed of light and white out.
Madness is in the past, and the perception of madness is the starting point.

"Trace, fractal."
Shrinking endlessly, expanding endlessly, multiplying endlessly.
The fantasy turns into chaos with law, it came from nothingness, but it didn't come from nothingness, and many similarities arise from expansion.

"I am the bone of my sword."

I ready the sword I projected.

     "Kaladbolg."

There's no need to aim.
The image of it hitting is there, so this attack will surely hit Saber.

"Gi, guh.........!!!!!"
It's      .
Som          unreturnable         breaks.

I see the result with my ruptured left eye.
Rider has retreated from Saber.
Having just repelled the spiral sword, Saber is unable to pursue her.
The small opening lasts a mere two seconds.
But those two seconds are more than Rider needs.

"Noble Phantasm!"
Fifty meters.
Seeing the sudden gap between them, Saber instantly realizes Rider's intention.
Then there's only one way to oppose it.
A strongest attack for a strongest attack.

Black light flows out.
A scorching wind bursts forth from Saber's sword.
A comet will attack her in the next second.
The strongest Noble Phantasm is employed to wipe out the pure white light from Rider.

"Saber......!!!!!!"
Rider lowers her stance.
The summoning circle's already completed.
A giant eye bound by blood materializes in front of her.

"Come, Rider!"
The sword, readied beside her.
Converging and spinning, the light of the star reaches the critical point.
The black sun stands ready, the flare held in both hands.

"Bellero"
Its true name is cast.
Rider's figure is instantly covered in white.

"Ex"
The true name is revealed.
Saber's sword transforms into a blazing black flame.

  "Phon!!!!!!!!!"
  "Calibur!!!!!!"
The two lights in the cavern contend for supremacy!

At that instant, I stop time.
I accelerate all my processes, disguising this instant as eternity.

"Trace, on."
Search, select, analyze, project.
That's my role.

The second projection.
Magic that shaves my existence away.
But we can't beat Saber without it.
We can't match Saber's Noble Phantasm, even with Bellerophon.

We knew that already.
So I'm going to make her win.
If Rider's Noble Phantasm is inferior in force, I'll make up for the difference...!!!!

"I am the bone of my sword."

I already know what I have to use.
The projection's completed in an instant.
The greatest protection Archer knows, the Noble Phantasm that will lead Rider to victory!

"Rho Aius!"

I make it into reality using its true name!

"Gah!"
A shudder runs through my outstretched arm.
Nerves, muscles, and blood dance around like mad.
I frantically hold my convulsing left arm with my right.

"Gu......! Ah, ah, ahh!"
Bear it.
I can't stop the projection.
The lights are still competing.
If Rider loses Aius now, she'll be vaporized in an instant!

"Giah,    ,  !"
My left arm jumps about, while my shoulder fires bullets into my body.
The magical energy I can't control explodes inside my body, and just like an eraser, turns Emiya Shirou's body white.

"      ,                                 !!!!"
I roar out.
I scream to ward off the pain and the fear of losing myself.

Bare magical energy is smashed.
It completely destroys the balance between the two.

"Ah, ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!"

Scattering the fourth petal the black ultimate light penetrated through, it fills the cavern
with bright, white light.

The two Servants are blown away.
Rider smashes against the wall at the exact speed at which she charged.
Saber is hurled backward by Bellerophon and falls to the ground on her back.

They're both alive.
Rider must've used up her magical energy as she's still on the ground.
But Sabershe's deeply wounded, but she still has some power left.

"!"
We barely had the edge in the confrontation of the Noble Phantasms.
Bellerophon had ninety percent of its light offset by Saber's holy sword.

"Ah"
I run.
I run without understanding what I have to do.
I release the Azoth Sword while I run.

"Sa, ber."
I run to her.
I run to her and straddle her defenseless body.

"AhShi, rou?"
Did she hit her head?
Saber's looking up at me absent-mindedly.

"Ah."
How must I look to her?
I'm on top of her, looking down with a dagger upraised.


Saber's natural healing power is extraordinary.
She'll regenerate unless I finish her off right now.
Finish her here.
We'll be killed unless I kill Saber, who's wounded and unable to fight back.
"! Rider......!!"
I trust her.
I have to trust her and wait.

What good will it do, even if I attack Saber now?
What can I do with my projection that's already prepared?
Our plan's already been determined.
Rider accepted my strategy, temporarily acknowledging me as her master.
So

"!"
Saber's sword cuts through empty space.
Rider has already retreated out of Saber's range.
And it's the greatest retreat possible.
She jumps back to the edge of the cavern.

Saber can't pursue her.
Rider's chain is tangled around her legs.
That's why Rider went on her knees.
Rider persistently attacked Saber's upper body, entangled her legs as the final attack, and nailed her in place by piercing the nail dagger into the ground.

"You cannot stop me with such a thing...!"
Magical energy courses through Saber's body.
Saber takes on lightning and easily destroys the chain.

"!"
But it's too late.
The small opening lasts a mere two seconds, but that's more than Rider needs.

"Noble Phantasm!"
Fifty meters.
Seeing the sudden gap between them, Saber instantly realizes Rider's intention.
Then there's only one way to oppose it.
A strongest attack for a strongest attack.

Black light flows out.
A scorching wind bursts forth from Saber's sword.
A comet will attack her in the next second.
The strongest Noble Phantasm is employed to wipe out the pure white light from Rider.

"Saber......!!!!!!"
Rider lowers her stance.
The summoning circle's already completed.
A giant eye bound by blood materializes in front of her.

"Come, Rider!"
The sword, readied beside her.
Converging and spinning, the light of the star reaches the critical point.
The black sun stands ready, the flare held in both hands.

"Bellero"
Its true name is cast.
Rider's figure is instantly covered in white.

"Ex"
The true name is revealed.

Finish her here.
We'll be killed unless I kill Saber, who's wounded and unable to fight back.
"AhAh."
My fragmented mind is strangely clear right now.


...She must be conscious again.
Saber's staring at me with cold eyes.
I...
There's no hesitation.
Holding her gaze, I bring down my heavy arm.

There's no resistance.
I end Saber's life with one blow.

", "
There were memories.
There was the warmth of life.
Her warmth was always by my side.

I kill her along with those memories.
I search through my mind and throw them away to where I can't find them again.
They'll never return.
I'll never recall her now.
Such a thing will never be forgiven.

I chose this path.
I killed someone else to save Sakura.
Using my own hands, I killed someone who protected me until the very end.
Neither regret nor a confession will bring forgiveness.
...This is what it means to ally with someone.
I'll keep sacrificing important things for the one I love.

And on this path...
There's nothing brilliant enough to make up for what I've lost.

"But Saber"
I'll search all my life for happiness that can measure up to what I've lost.
I'll keep losing more than I gain, and I know I'll stop someday.
ButI'm going to take responsibility for stealing things away, even if I'm pathetic, comical, or meaningless.

I don't know where I can find happiness.
But I swear to myself that I'll never give up, even if I can't see the end.

"Thanks. You saved me many times."

...The weight on my dagger disappears.
Silent to the end, the dark swordsman sinks into the black shadow, her eyes fixed on me.
...I can't bring the blade down.
My hand's shaking, and I can't pierce Saber's heart.


She's just looking up at me.
She's staring at me without emotion or interest.

Only a few days.
It's only been eight days since the night I lost her.
...No I should say it's already been eight days.
It's been that long since I lost her clear, golden hair and her gentle, green eyes.

I can still clearly recall her silver armor and the beauty of her attacks.
Even though I knew nothing, she accepted me as her Master, serving as my sword to the very end.
No matter how many times she was wounded and faced death.
      Her determination never wavered.

I won't forget about it.
I can't forget about that night, that miracle.
The golden hair shining under the moonlight.
It's...
An eternal scene that will never be lost, no matter how much she changes.


And I realize.
I can't kill Saber.
Even though she has turned dark and her magical energy's ominous, she's still the Saber that protected me.
Sohow can I kill her?

"Sa, ber."
...The dagger falls.
Not onto her chest, but onto the ground.

"........."
The black swordsman says nothing.
Her body's completely healed now.
...It's probably because of the enormous amount of Sakura's magical energy.
Her body's not the only thing that healed, as her magical energy is charged as well.

"Shirou. I have cursed you for the first time."
I can understand Saber's hatred.
"You are telling me to kill you."
It's natural that she's disappointed.

"Very well.
 As you wish, I shall"
The cave rumbles.
What's happening off in the darkness?
A rumbling, like a death cry, comes from the way Tohsaka went.

The vibration sounds like a lamentation.
The person causing the rumbling is frantically calling for help?

"Saber...!?"
I don't know if it's because of the vibration, but Saber's body is sinking into the ground.
No, she's being swallowed up by her own shadow.

"Give me your hand, Saber...!"
"I shall postpone your execution. Sakura is asking for help."

"......!"
...The shadow fades away.
Having drawn Saber in, it seeps into the rock and disappears.





", "

"!"
I suddenly wake up.
I realize I'm sleeping in an unfamiliar place.

"............"
...No, something's wrong.
Something's wrong, but I can't put my finger on it.

"Ha, guh"
I get up.
I shake my head and clear my mind.
"...That's right. I have to go."
I eliminated something important at the cost of something important.

"...The dagger... I have to take the dagger."
I pull the Azoth sword from the ground.
That's odd.
Why is the dagger that was in my hand sticking out of the ground?

"Guh"
I tighten the restraint on my left arm.
I've used up most of the magical energy.
What's left in Archer's arm and myself.
I should be able to do more if I combine them, but I can only manage one more projection. I won't be able to suppress Archer's arm after that.


...I'm forgetting something.
...But I should hurry for now.
My body's stiff.
I feel like I'm a tin man.

......Someone's calling for me in the distance.
The voice, the unfamiliar voice, feels like something important, and I move my tin body forward.

It takes time to go through the cave.
The rumbling has already stopped.
A warm wind that makes me want to vomit is coming from the back.


My left arm hurts.
My brain shreds a little more with each step, and my thoughts are crumbling apart like a collapsing building.

I escape from the black darkness into the white darkness.
...My body's burning.
I'm a brazier, and it feels like I'm thrown inside a furnace.

My headache's getting worse.
My breath is hot, and the air's even hotter.
The heat burns my lungs, and the rotten air sticks to my throat.
I was wrong.
This isn't a furnace.  It's like being inside a giant stomach.


This is the last stage.
The final destination, where Sakura hid herself, Zouken lurked, and Tohsaka has now gone.
But it's too quiet.
I don't feel any battles going on.
Everything's so intensely white that I can't find Zouken's laughter, Tohsaka's figure, or Sakura's downcast expression.


I walk forward without a thought for what might have happened.
I don't have time or energy to waste on that.
My thoughts are a precious resource right now.
I can project one more time.
I can't degrade my final weapon with unnecessary speculation.

I scale the cliff.
I keep my head blank as I climb, conserving what little of my mind remains.

A pillar of light that's like a black sun.
There...
...Stands Sakura, transfigured to black.

"Sakura."
"...?"
Sakura looks at me with wonder.
Red eyes without emotion.

"Sa"
The coldness of her eyes brings everything to a halt.
How stupid.
I made the same mistake again.

"Oh, you're here, Senpai. You were so late, I thought you ran away.
 I'm sorry, I'll call myself back.
 It was a mistake to arrange them at the exit to surprise you."

She smiles.
At that instant, my spine turns to ice.
Sakura's smile is so unlike her that it makes me forget about what I have to say or what I have to project.

"Sakura. Where's Tohsaka?"
I ask a stupid question.
Completely forgetting about bringing Sakura back, I ask something I don't need to, something that's readily apparent.

"Eh... Nee-san?"
My question hasn't taken her by surprise.
It seems she's pitying me for failing to grasp something so obvious.

"That's right. Tohsaka should've come here before me. Where is she?"
"............"

The air's hot.
It feels like the wind on my skin is melting my body.

...I look around the cavern from here.
I don't see Tohsaka below.
The only sign of human life is here.
...By Sakura's feet.
A cloth that looks like a ribbon is on the ground, dyed in black.

Tohsaka's presence is gone.
Tohsaka's body is gone.
Tohsaka's bloodstain doesn't even exist.

"Sakura, you..."
"Yes, you're right. Nee-san's nowhere in this world now.
 BecauseI consumed her just now."

Who is it?

"Oh, I didn't leave any leftovers.
 I finished every bit of her body and mind. Even with this body, I still remember my manners."

Who is it?

"But Nee-san isn't dead. She's still suffering inside of me.
 ...Hah. So she was a virgin. I'm letting her experience what I've been through, but she's already crying on the first day."

"Can you hear her? She's screaming for help and apologizing.
 Oh... How cute of you to say that. She said 'please let me out of here, Sakura.'
 Stupid Nee-san. I want to have more fun if you say that."

Who is it?

"Fufu, I might lose myself since it's so good.
 Thanks for the food, Senpai. The person you brought me was a delicious treat."

Who's outer shell is that?

My remaining thoughts ignite.
My reason explodes, and I'm starting to forget what I'm supposed to do and who the person in front of me is.

"Sakura, you"
...You went too far, too far away for me to retrieve you.

"Please stop. Don't look at me with those eyes.
 ...Don't you know it's your own fault? You spared Saber, so Nee-san wasn't able to kill me in the end.
 If Saber hadn't come to save me, I would've been killed instead."


"But I'm so happy. You saved Saber and me, and you killed Nee-san.
 So"

"No, I..."

"I'll swallow you too.
 Come on, Senpai, Nee-san's waiting for you."

"Nee-san's been asking for your help. You should go to her and hold her hand or something."

The shadow falls.
The light from the pillar's blocked off as if a giant wall is created.

...Black shadows emerge.
I don't know where they came from, but the giants surround me like a prison.


There's nowhere to run.
The giants melt into each other, becoming a tidal wave that surges over me.

All my senses disappear in an instant.
An infinite, boundless darkness.
I hear someone weeping as I fall into Sakura's shadow.
She is released.
The black Command Spell cloaking her body disappears.

A contract-breaker.
A Noble Phantasm that nullifies all magic and negates the contract with a Servant.
Without taking Sakura's life, it destroys the contract that bound her.

My vision isn't continuous.
Sakura's alive.
I don't know if it's reaction from being released, but she's lying on the ground like she's sleeping.

TohsakaTohsaka will make it too.
She's not bleeding anymore. She has a legitimate Magic Crest.
The Crest is the crystallization of the Tohsaka family's magic. It won't let their successor die even if she's unconscious.


The cavern is shaking.
Angra Manyu.
A ridiculous curse called "all evils of the world" is writhing.

...Damn.
Even after losing its host, the black shadow hasn't disappeared.
It has grown too large.
It can come out without Sakura's help.
It will emerge so long as the Great Holy Grail still exists.

I'll destroy it.
I'll destroy the giant magic circle, and the shadow along with it.
Angra Manyu's fetal activity is slowly destroying the cavern.
...But I don't think it'll die even if the cavern collapses.
I have to destroy that thing here and now.

Is it possible?
...Yes, it's possible.
I'll go as near it as I can and attack it with great force.

Angra Manyu can't move as long as it's in the black fire.
I'll cleave it in two before he can emerge.
If there's anything capable of such a feat, it's
The greatest Noble Phantasm I know of.

"Guh."
My breathing stopped for a moment.
There's about a hundred meters to Angra Manyu.
...It's fine, I can walk this distance.
It's just one more time.
One last projection, and it's all over.
It's fine, I'll be able to do it.
I'll finish this off, take the two of them above ground, and...

"Shirou, do you hear me?"
Someone taps my shoulder.


...Who is this?
She can't possibly be a stranger.
I know her. She looks dangerous, but I remember that she's trustworthy.

"Good. Can you take Sakura and Tohsaka and get out of here?"
"Shirou?"
The long-haired woman stares at me for a few seconds.

"What about you?"
"I'll go after I destroy that thing. It'll be quick, but every second counts for Tohsaka. And Sakura would be affected by the shadow if she stays here. Angra Manyu might be persistent and make Sakura his Master again."

"Understood. I will carry Rin and Sakura.
 Please rest assured. I have rested enough for that."
"Please. Go outside with those two. The cavern's collapsing. Um, RR- damn, your speed would have no problem with the falling rocks."

".....................
 Then I will be going. I shall come get you after I get them to a safe place."

"Um... That's nice to hear, but make sure they're okay first. You're the only one I can trust. I'll escape by myself, so please treat Tohsaka. Sakura can't be happy without her."

...I don't think this woman has any ability to heal people.
But I still have to entrust her with Tohsaka's life.

"Certainly. But the same goes for you, Shirou.
 Sakura needs you and Rin. Please remember that. ...I need you to support Sakura."

"......?"
"I shall hurry. Good luck."

The woman in black picks them up with ease and runs down the cliff.
Weaving between the falling rocks, she hurries to the exit.

"Phew."
...I don't have to worry about them now.
They'll be saved if I let her take care of them.
So
Now, I just need to take care of one more thing.
;  ", , "
My consciousness is breaking apart.
A mere hundred meters become an impossibly vast expanse.

;  ", , "
It's only a matter of time before the cavern collapses.
The ceiling's crumbling down, and the ground is becoming a pile of rubble.

;  ", , "
My joints are stiff.
It hurts to bend my limbs.
My nerves are hot.
Hundreds of blades are growing out of my body.
An inescapable death by skewering.
I am the bone of my sword.
I already knew that.
The time bomb was activated when I used projection.
This end has already been determined.

"Ha, ah!"
I'm crumbling apart.
I'll shatter if I continue.
I'll shatter to pieces, like so many rocks on the ground.

...I'll still make it.
My body's dying, but I won't lose myself for about a day if I stop now.

Only a day's worth of life prolongation.
But right now, I would love to have something so insignificant.
Just a day. An hour or even a minute.
If I can live, I want to stay here as long as I can, no matter how miserable it may be.

"Haa, gu......!"
A crack.
Not outside, but inside. The nucleus accumbens in my cerebrum breaks.
The part that administers the principle of behavior, the linkage to pleasure.
The most important part of life. Life is the pursuit of pleasure; without it, humans would become beasts.

"Haa, ah."
It's not convenient.
I still want it.
I want to keep my memory for as long as I can.
But it's disintegrating.
The pain of eating my fingers doesn't stop the memories from fading.

I disappear the more I walk on.
I won't make it.
Even if I do make it there, I probably won't remember what I need to do.
So I should stop here and wait for help

"Yeah, I remember."
But.
Somewhere outside my body, there's a big reason.
"Sakuralet's go see flowers."
So I have to fulfill my role.

Time has stopped.
There's no pain.
I'm taking a whole day to make just one step.

I forget how to breathe.
There's no pain.
I couldn't breathe if I had all day to do it.

I lose the meaning.
What was pain?
Organic matter turns into inorganic substance.

I manage to keep myself.
I reach out for the wall to keep from falling.
All the shards of my existence are gathered onto a tiny foothold.
There's no way it'll support me.
The foothold breaks.

There's no principle of behavior.
There's no meaning of behavior.
There's no meaning of existence.
I don't feel any fear.
The meaning behind my existence disappears.

I'm not alive anymore.
My arms won't move for any reason.

"Trace."
Words come out of my mouth.
There's something still remaining even after language, neopallium, and cerebrum
are lost.

"On."
The body dies.
But the soul remains.

Spinning the eight verses.
The load transmits from the body to the soul, and more meaning is

"Ah."
And Emiya Shirou dies.
The standing figure is no different from a machine.
It's programmed to swing the sword, but it's a corpse with no desire to move.

But even without human intelligence...
There are machines that weave many dreams in this world.

There was a promise.
Once winter's over, when it's spring

A recitation of words without meaning.
A small hope that I remembered until the very end.


I take a breath, drawing enough oxygen to allow me to move.

My throat only moves once.

Fortunately, it's not painful.
Most of my senses have turned to steel.

No matter how hard I try.
       I'm starting to feel faint.

Let's go.
       It's my final job.

I release my left arm.
My consciousness is about to fade away.

"Trace, on."

...My last projection.
I'll use the strongest sword I know to destroy the curse along with the Great Holy Grail.


It'll be the definite end.
I...

My consciousness is breaking apart.

My joints are stiff.
It hurts to bend my limbs.
If I let my guard down, I stop breathing. Finally, with the determination it would take to stick a knife in my throat, I manage to draw a few breaths.
I keep doing it in spite of the pain, because people can't live without oxygen.
I might be able to move without oxygen, and even if I am to breathe, I would stop moving soon.

Hundreds of blades are growing out of my body.
An inescapable death by skewering.

So this end was already determined.

...My legs are heavy.
...I don't know what I'm doing.
My heart's about to explode from pain, fatigue, and emptiness.
But just a bit more.
Everything will end once I beat him.
There's no one in my way.
There's no one getting in my way anymore.

But.

"Haaah"
The shadow wavers.
In front of the crater, the Great Holy Grail.
Bathed in the ruddy glow,  is standing.

"Kotomine Kirei."
"Yes. It seems we've both managed to survive, Emiya Shirou."
A voice filled with strong will.
As if it's fate, the man blocks my way through this desolate realm.

"What are you doing?
 There's nothing for you to do now."
I don't ask him how he's alive.
He's dying.
I don't feel magical energy from his body.
There's a black stain where his heart should be.
...Like me, a brief fire that's like a turned hourglass.

I don't hear his heartbeat.
He doesn't have much longer to live.
This is not speculation, but a predication.
Kotomine Kirei will die in a few minutes, even if he doesn't do anything.

"Do not ask something so obvious.
 There is only one goal for me: to give birth to the curse."
"What? You can't do that. He won't become yours."

"Of course not. I cannot intervene with this, and I have no intention to.
 But I have told you. I will bless anything that comes to life.
 This is about to be born. So it is only natural for me to protect it from an outside enemy that tries to kill it."

"...Are you insane? What are you saying with that dying body of yours? And even if it's born like you wish, you'll"

"The same goes for you. There is no sanity here. Our end will be the same, even if we accomplish our goals.
 You will destroy it, while I will protect it.
 But there is nothing to be gained, no matter whose goal is achieved. You came here knowing that.
 This is a meaningless battle. We are two madmen engaging in useless folly."


...Kotomine will not back down.
He won't retreat, and I can't use projection as long as he's there.
I need time to project.
He'll smash my head if I show such an opening.

"...Why? Why are you going so far to protect him?
 Even if he's born, you gain nothing. So why?"
Even on the verge of death, why does he approve of mankind's enemy, all evils of this world?

"There is no room for questions. This is my only pleasure.
 Emiya Shirou.
 As you feel supreme bliss in others' happiness.
 I feel supreme bliss in others' unhappiness."


"First of all, why kill it? It is arrogance to assume it is evil even before its birth. Is it not love to allow a life that yearns to be born into the world?"

"Don't bullshit me. He's killed many people already. I can't let him out."
"Oh. Then let me ask. What is good and evil? Are you saying murder is an absolute evil?"

"That's......"
...I can't answer such a question.
Good and evil mean nothing to me now.
The justice Emiya Shirou believed in disappeared the instant I decided to save Sakura.

"Fair enough. There is no answer from the start. That's what humans are like. There is no clear answer, and they accept a changing truth. We have no absolute truth from the very beginning.
 Humans have both good and evil, and it's up to you to decide which is which. The start is at zero, and there is no crime in being born. I thought I'd already told you."

"Yeah. You said there's no crime in the baby even if it's evil."

"Correct. Humans become good or evil through learning.
 A certain scripture mentions that humans are superior beings to angels. Why? Because there are people who know of evil, but do not become evil.
 It's different from angels, who only know of good since birth.
 Humans have evil, but can live as good, so they are superior to angels, who only know of good."

"And at the same time.
 There are rare moments of goodwill shown by evil men.
 There are bad intentions shown on a whim by saints.
 The contradiction. The coexistence of good and evil is the Holy Grail that makes people human.
 Living is a crime by itself, and there are punishments because one is alive. Good exists with life, and evil exists with life.
 Therefore"

"You cannot inquire about the crime of one who has not yet been born.
 There is no existence that is born as evil, that is unwanted by everyone.
 It has no reason to be punished until it is born."

That's Kotomine's answer.
That man pardons "all evils of this world" for this reason alone.

"So you're going to forgive him? He's someone that can only kill. If you know he'll kill many people once he comes out, he's a definite evil for us...!"

"Yes. His nature is evil. He was made that way, after all. He was born to be evil from the very beginning.
 He's not like people. This is a pure deity that people made.
 Buteven if his actions are evil, we have yet to know what he thinks of it."

"Eh...?"
What Angra Manyu thinks about his own actions...?

"Yes.
 If Angra Manyu considers them evil and agonizes over them, or considers them good and laughs about them. That is not something we can assume.
 If that thing has emotions like those of humans and agonizes over its doings, it is evil.
 But if it has no doubt about its existence, it is good. Everyone wished for him to be that way, after all. If it has no doubt about its function, it cannot be evil."

"Wha"
"Yes.
 Those with defects at birth.
 Those who were not wanted, even before birth.
 It should show us the worth of worthless life: the meaning of birth."

"Would it be able to forgive itself after destroying and losing everything?
 That's what I would like to know.
 I want to know if it is a crime to live as you are, when you are different from others.
 That is why I killed your father and let Matou Sakura live. I cannot come up with the answer by myself. That is why I wish for the birth of what can provide me with the answer."

"That is my goal, Emiya Shirou.
 I am at the opposite extreme from you, as you have no wish for yourself. Our desires are of the same nature."


...I can't comprehend him.
His wish is too alien for me.
...So there's only one thing I understand.
That's the only reason he...

"Sakura. You used Sakura for such a thing?"
I shake off the vagueness, glaring at the priest with all the hostility I can muster.

And...
"Yes. To that end, I have taken many lives. That is why I cannot back out now.
 I told you. That is how I lived.
 I lived to answer that question.
 It will not change, even on the verge of my death."
He makes this declaration, holding my gaze.


His words are bold.
He states it as a matter of course, saying he has no regret or doubts.

"........................I see."
That makes me realize.
We're irreconcilable. I opposed him ever since I first saw him.
...I finally realize why.

I don't want to admit it.
But it seems... I like Kotomine Kirei.
I was frantic to see him as an enemy because I didn't want to accept the fact.

He said we're similar.
I understand now.
We both believed ourselves to be sinners.
And we both lived in a certain way to free ourselves of those chains.
We both knew we could never be freed, but believed it was the right atonement, and sought salvation that would never be given to us.

"Of course you're not going to back out."
There's no way he'll withdraw if he's the same as me.
It's not that he's trying to grant his wish because he's about to die.

...That's right. It's not that he's protecting his oath in his last moments.
That's how he lived until now.
He never walked a different path.
So even if he's to die in the next minute, he doesn't know any other way to live.

"......Humph. And this is also a way to take out my anger.
 I knew it was a possibility, but at last I realize it."

He steps forward.
There's not much time left for either of us.
So we have to settle the match quickly.
We have to extinguish the other's fire before our own blows out.

"I envy you people.
 What I sought, but could not obtain. What I obtained, but could not obtain. Many things slipped out between my fingers, no matter what commandment I used."

'What other people called happiness'

"I am going to release my pent-up emotions here."

'Did not bring me any joy.'

...Yeah. He's empty because he couldn't obtain it, no matter what he tried.
He sought and sought, but couldn't obtain happiness.
And the only way of life he found was carrying death.
So how can he abandon his way of life now?

"I see. I guess I made you waste your time, Kotomine."
I resume breathing.
Pulling oxygen into my lungs, I get my body ready for battle.

"I do not mind. Neither one of us has much time."
Strength enters Kotomine's body.
There's no way this is going to turn into a battle of magic.
We're both almost dead.
All we can do it to drive our fists into our opponent.
There's no technique or strategy involved. It's a mere brawl to the death.

He needs to kill me to make his wish come true.
I need to kill him to destroy his wish.
We both put our lives on the line.
I need to beat him and eliminate the shadow before my life burns out.

He kicks off of the ground and runs straight at me.
"Haa"
I don't have such power left in my legs.
I lower my stance, eyes fixed on his oncoming chest, and...
"Ahhhhhhhh!"
I swing my fist full-force at a speed he can't avoid...!

But my fist swings through empty space, and I'm the one who gets hit.

"Guh!?"
I don't see Kotomine.
That speed. The enemy that charged me disappears from my view in an instant, crouches down by my left side, slams his palm into my stomach, and kicks up at my body with his lightning fast legs.

"Haaguh......!"
His kicks are like fire.
It's been a while since I felt pain strong enough to make me lose consciousness.

"Gi"
How many meters was I kicked up?
The impact was strong enough to rip my head off.
No, if I'm going to talk about impact, then the second blow to my stomach was strong enough to pulverize my organs.

"You"
I know this.
Taking the shortest route without any initial movement. A circle and a line. It tries to damage the inside instead of outside.
"A priest using Chinese martial arts?"
And he's really good at it.
It's not something he copied on the spot...!

"That's not true. My moves are mere mimicry. It's a mimicry of taolu without much in itbut it seems to be enough against a dying man."
He turns to me.

"......!"
He strikes again.
Forcing my fused joints to bend, I get up.

"......?"
But Kotomine stops and looks at his fist.
His hand's covered in red.
"What a troublesome body. The one attacking has to risk his life."
It is...
...A price he had to pay to attack a body made of swords.

"Haaah."
...I gather my consciousness and face my enemy.
It doesn't matter.
He won't stop attacking, even if faced with the thorns of death.

"But this should make a good handicap.
 In short, our fight is..."

"!"
Kotomine lowers his stance.
His trained body is getting ready for the explosion.

"Not a fight against someone else, but a battle with your body at stake!"

The enemy closes in.
Kotomine is far stronger than me.
His fists won't break.
At this rate, the hourglass itself will be destroyed before all the sand spills to the bottom.

"Haa"
I don't look away from my enemy, closing in like a spark.
There's only one thing I have to do.
I have to be faster than last time. I have to punch him faster, even if he avoids it.

All I can hear is the sound of my heart, pounding in my ears.
I take no notice of the rumbling or the raining bits of earth.

The one I must defeat is right in front of me.
I don't care about some centuries-old wish or the end of this small world.
For Emiya Shirou, defeating this enemy is the last remaining purpose.
", , "
My consciousness is breaking apart.

It's only a matter of time before the cavern collapses.
The ceiling's crumbling down, and the ground is becoming a pile of rubble.

My joints are stiff.
It hurts to bend my limbs.
My nerves are hot.
Hundreds of blades are growing out of my body.
An inescapable death by skewering.
I am the bone of my sword.
I already knew that.
The time bomb was activated when I used projection.
This end has already been determined.

"Ha, ah!"
I'm crumbling apart.
I'll shatter if I continue.
I'll shatter to pieces, like so many rocks on the ground.

...I'll still make it.
My body's dying, but I won't lose myself for about a day if I stop now.

Only a day's worth of life prolongation.
But right now, I would love to have something so insignificant.
Just a day. An hour or even a minute.
If I can live, I want to stay here as long as I can, no matter how miserable it may be.

"Haa, gu......!"
A crack.
Not outside, but inside. The nucleus accumbens in my cerebrum breaks.
The part that administers the principle of behavior, the linkage to pleasure.
The most important part of life. Life is the pursuit of pleasure; without it, humans would become beasts.

"Haa, ah."
It's not convenient.
I still want it.
I want to keep my memory for as long as I can.
But it's disintegrating.
The pain of eating my fingers doesn't stop the memories from fading.

I disappear the more I walk on.
I won't make it.
Even if I do make it there, I probably won't remember what I need to do.
So I should stop here and wait for help

"Yeah, I remember."
But.
Somewhere outside my body, there's a big reason.
"Sakuralet's go see flowers."
So I have to fulfill my role.

Time has stopped.
There's no pain.
I'm taking a whole day to make just one step.

I forget how to breathe.
There's no pain.
I couldn't breathe if I had all day to do it.

I lose the meaning.
What was pain?
Organic matter turns into inorganic substance.

I manage to keep myself.
I reach out for the wall to keep from falling.
All the shards of my existence are gathered onto a tiny foothold.
There's no way it'll support me.
The foothold breaks.

There's no principle of behavior.
There's no meaning of behavior.
There's no meaning of existence.
I don't feel any fear.
The meaning behind my existence disappears.

I'm not alive anymore.
My arms won't move for any reason.

"Trace."
Words come out of my mouth.
There's something still remaining even after language, neopallium, and cerebrum
are lost.

"On."
The body dies.
But the soul remains.

Spinning the eight verses.
The load transmits from the body to the soul, and more meaning is

"Ah."
And Emiya Shirou dies.
The standing figure is no different from a machine.
It's programmed to swing the sword, but it's a corpse with no desire to move.

But even without human intelligence...
There are machines that weave many dreams in this world.

There was a promise.
Once winter's over, when it's spring

A recitation of words without meaning.
A small hope that I remembered until the very end.
No.
I can't go back if I use it.
I know I'm going to disappear anyway.
But I have to try to find some other way as long as I'm alive.

I promised that I'll protect Sakura from everything.
I can't selfishly die.
I want to live with Sakura.
So

"Trace"

...But there's no other way.
Sakura's crime. The absolute requirement for Sakura's happiness is the destruction of this curse.

...Only a single grain of my consciousness is left.
Sakura, I
"Trace, on."
The promise I made with you

;  "            "
A sword is in my hand.
     is      body      last

No, you won't die, Shirou.
     Because I'm the one that's going to shut the gate.


It's...
The voice of someone I can't remember.

"   ?"
I can't remember, but I call her name.
I know I have to do it.
Because     will never return if I don't.

Hey.
Do you want to live, Shirou? Do you want to live on, no matter what kind of life you become?

;  "       "
I want to live. Name. I have to call her name and stop her.
But I want to live. I know      will disappear if I nod, but I want to live from the bottom of my heart.

Yeah.
I'm glad to hear that. I wanted you to live instead of me.

;  "    "
What are you saying, idiot?
Just come back. You won't be able to return if you go any further.
I'll take him, so, damn, I have to remember her name, but my head's turned stupid, and the important name is...

Then I'll show you a miracle.
It's an application of the magic I showed you earlier, but this one's amazing.
This is the sorcery everyone wanted to see, after all.

"   a."
No, I don't need to see it. Just come back.
I...

But the container's a bit cheap.
I can't completely reproduce it using only my own body, but it's all right. You'll be back in no time if you and Rin keep trying.

"   a......!"
She goes to the center.
The person in white becomes the sacrifice, just like in the first ritual to close the Great Holy Grail.

Goodbye.
 We aren't related by blood.
 But I'm glad we were siblings.


  ya.
If that's how you feel, then don't go.
I can't sacrifice you. I said we'd live together to make up for all the time you've lived alone.
Butif one of us has to be sacrificed, then

No.
You said an older brother protects his younger sister, right?
...Yeah. I'm the older sister. So I have to protect my younger brother.

"Ilya."
I remember.
Her name.
Kiritsugu's real blood relative. The girl who was left alone because I came and stole him.
A girl with silver hair and red eyes that's a bit older than me

"IlyaIlya, Ilya, Ilya, Ilya, Ilya, Ilya, Ilya, Ilya!!!"
I can't reach her.
I don't hear voices any more.
I can't see anything in this light.
And at the last moment.

She smiles goodbye and shuts the gate of the Great Holy Grail.

     I can see the sky.

I can go into the sky if I reach out just a bit.

But there's nothing left.
There's absolutely no energy left in my body.

I'm sinking.
The life she saved is sinking.

I clench my fist out of vexation.
I feel something cold in my hand.
The sensation rouses my mind

  'It's all right. Rin will save you.'

Yeah.
There's a miracle in my hand.
A little magical energy.
A small, useless pendant, but it can at least help me reach out with my hands.

I reach out.
The gentle atmosphere and the warm sun hits my skin.

In my hand is the endless blue sky
There's no reception.
The Ryudou Temple hides in the dark, emitting alien powers like a crouching giant.
There must be wind blowing far above me.
If I strain my ears, I can hear it howling.

"...I feel a power from atop the stairs. It seems something is being created in the pond behind the compound."
"No, we don't have any business there. The gate above must be the ostensible gate for the Masters that want the Holy Grail. ...If we want the Great Holy Grail, we have to go down instead of up."
Tohsaka walks away from the stairs into the forest.

"...Are you all right, Rider? There's a boundary field around the Ryudou Temple, right? I heard Servants can only go in from the front gate."

"...I feel some strain, but this is tolerable.
 This area contains the most suitable ley line in the land. Once we get inside, I can recover by drawing mana from the air."
"I see. It must be tough, but please bear with us for a bit."

  We push our way through the tree branches.
There's not even an animal trail over the mountain, so we even have to climb down rock walls.

"Hmit should be around here, according to Ilya... Do you see anything like an entrance, Shirou?"
"What do you mean, 'like'?"

"Like a crack in a rock that we can slip through, or a suspicious-looking shrine. It's an entrance, so I don't think it'd just be a pit."
"...Don't be ridiculous. The stars are out, but I can't see anything in a forest at night"

...Oh, I can.
We must be behind the temple, because I see many dead trees.
There's no sign of human influence.  There's nothing here but dead trees and a small stream.

"...Small stream?"
Hold on.
That means the water's coming from somewhere.

"...Rider. There's a bunch of rocks above the stream, right?
 It's too dark for me to see, but is that a cave?"
"Please do not turn around, Shirou."
I hear a small metallic sound.
Rider must've taken off her restraint.

"......Yes. It's a natural cave, but you should just be able to fit through. It looks like the path ends about a meter in, but I sense a magical camouflage."
"I see, thanks. Tohsaka. I guess there is something like it."

We pick our way down to the stream.
...It's more like a spring flowing out from the rocks.

The stones are piled atop one another where it starts. There's a crack big enough for one person to fit through.
It's like a snow hut made from rocks.
You can see that a huge boulder is blocking the entrance, so nobody would even try to go in it.

"This is it. You can pass through the rock."
Tohsaka walks into the darkness without turning around.
"Please go ahead. I shall protect your back."
I nod and enter the darkness.

The sound of scraping on a hard surface.
I progress down the wet rock using my hands.
The ground slopes steeply downward.

...The weight of the darkness is stifling.
Unless I keep my back to the ground as I move, I might fall into the endless dark.

"........."
I lay flat on my back as I slowly descend.
......It's dark, and I can't tell how far down this path goes.
My breathing echoes in my ears.

"Shirou. I'm going to ask you now."
...Then.
Tohsaka, the one leading the way, suddenly speaks up.

"What?"
"The gem sword. Why did you make it for me?"
She sounds blunt, as if she's just asking to kill time while we're descending.

"Why ask?"
"I've told you I'm planning to kill Sakura.
 Can you really give me a weapon, knowing that?"

I nod in agreement.
Well, Tohsaka certainly has a point.

"I'm not okay with that. But I can't save Sakura without you. It's better to have two people instead of one.
 And projecting the sword was a promise.
 I couldn't keep one of my promises with you, so I wanted to keep the other."

It happened a long time ago.
I asked for Tohsaka's help after I lost Saber.
Tohsaka responded to my call for help, and I made a promise with her.

To let her win.
I promised to make her the victor.

...I can't keep that promise anymore.
So I have to keep the other promise with her.
For the girl I used to admire...
For Tohsaka Rin, who believed in someone who had nothing at the time.

"I see. You're pretty faithful."
"Yeah, but not as much as you."

Silence returns to the darkness.
The conversation ends.
We continue our descent without looking at each other.

A long path that seems to lead to hell.
The path spirals downward, and just as I'm thinking we're over a hundred meters underground...
The dark cave changes completely, welcoming us.

The path that could only accomodate one person widens up and leads on.
There's no need for light.
The cave is lit by a dim green glow, probably from some kind of luminous moss.

The path is saturated with life force.
It feels too lively.
An air of birth, filled with vigor and the joy of life.
An immense amount of odo, and mana so strong that it's almost visible.


It makes me want to vomit.
The warmth of life should be dazzling, but instead it's something rotten, making me want to look away.

"............"

I have no words to say to her.
This is a land of death.
Talking to each other to soften the tension would only cost us our lives.

"Let's go. From now on, look out for your own safety first."
...Tohsaka heads down the path, to the source of the black air.
Rider and I follow after her, concentrating on our surroundings.

"......?"
I see something red on the ground.
It's a trace of blood.
It leads to the back.


Did someone come here before us?
And someone wounded badly enough to leave behind a trail of blood?

"Shirou."
"...Sorry. I'll be right there."
I shake off that train of thought and head on.
I can't be worrying about others.

"!"
My consciousness fades away if I let my guard down.
I'll disappear if I worry about needless things.
"........."
I tighten my grip on the pendant.
Letting the pain clear my mind, I step into the green darkness.
A warm wind hits my cheeks.

At its end, the path opens into a cavern. 
It's about as big as the schoolground.
It's too dark to make out the ceiling, but it must be about ten meters high.

I don't detect any signs of life.
An unforgettable underground space that looks like the moonscape that I read about a long time ago.
And there...
Waits Saber, filled with absolute hostility.

She's the only one here.
I don't see Sakura, Zouken, or Assassin.
The only one blocking the way here is the girl who has turned black.

"Saber."

There's no reply.

...Of course.
Saber's duty is to eliminate any intruders.
She's the gatekeeper and the executioner.
Saber's the strongest Servant Sakura has, so she can fight us by herself.

"...Hmph. It doesn't look like we can talk her into letting us through."
Tohsaka lowers her stance and reaches for the gem sword she's hiding behind her back.

She must intend to fight head-on.
I don't know what kind of ability the sword has, but she's going to fight Saber.

But that's not a good idea.
We still have a countermeasure, since we know Saber's powers. We can't use our only secret weapon when Zouken and Assassin are still waiting for us

"Wait, Tohsaka...! Saber's"
"Rin. I have no reason to fight you. Please do not attack me. I will go against Sakura's orders if I kill you here."

"......!"
Speaking in the same quiet tones as before, Saber stops Tohsaka in her tracks.
We comprehend what she means right away.

"...What are you doing? You're keeping watch here, right?"
"Yes. I am to eliminate anyone that passes by here.
 That is Sakura's order. But"
"I'm an exception, and Sakura wants to see me?"
Saber nods.

"......I see. She must be serious."
She mutters.
...After taking a deep breath, Tohsaka walks over to Saber.

"Tohsaka."
"Sorry. I guess that's how it is, so I'm going ahead."
Tohsaka walks on without hesitation and passes by Saber.
And right before she disappears...

"Shirou. I don't know what'll happen to you, but I believe in you. So you'd better live up to my expectations."

"Huh?"
...Wait.
I can't understand if you complain to me without telling me what I should be doing.

"I-I'm saying it'll just be a pain if you come complaining after everything's over! ...Um, make sure you're not too late if you want to save Sakura."
Tohsaka disappears, her hair fluttering behind her.


...Thanks, Tohsaka.
That gave me strength.
In short, she told me to come help her while she keeps Sakura at bay.

"That is impossible. You will die here, Shirou."
"......!"

Her hostility expands.
Tohsaka left, and Rider and I are the only ones here.
So she doesn't have to hold back anymore, huh?

"I cannot overlook what you just said. You only kill those that pass through. If he merely stays here, you should not harm him."

"I will not attack if he does not move.
 But he will advance, no matter what. He knows he cannot defeat me, but all he can do is move forward.
 Am I wrong, Rider?"
"I see. You served him before me, after all.
 It's natural that you know his personality."

...Saber narrows her eyes.
The black holy sword is in her hands.
She's coming.
Rider or I.
If either one of us takes a step forward, Saber will use all her power to kill us.

"......Saber. There's nothing that'll make you back down?"
"Stop asking me that. I said this is my role."
I grab the Shroud.
...Saber shows no sign of hesitation.
We're already enemies.
I realized that back in the forest.

So...
"I see. Then I'll eliminate you here."
I have to accept it.


"I'm going to save Sakura. You're in my way."
Saber's not my only enemy.
There's still Assassin and Zouken.
I can't be wasting my time here.

"Please stay back, Shirou. I shall fight Saber just as you instructed me."
Removing the restraint on her mystic eyes, Rider motions me back with one hand.

Saber raises her sword.
The hostility is already aimed at Rider

"Don't be stupid. I said we're both going to fight her. You..."
"I may not be able to defeat her, but I can keep her occupied. Fortunately, Saber does not have the ability to repel mystic eyes.
 I cannot petrify her as she has more magical energy, but I can pressure her. I can match her for two minutes if I use all my strength."

Rider's eyes capture Saber.
The mystic eyes, which petrify anyone in her sight, temporarily lower Saber's ability.

"I will create the situation. Please stay there and concentrate so you do not miss our chance."
"Rider."
"I will be going. I shall entrust you with my life, Shirou."

Rider disappears.
The black cavalryman dashes at the swordsman with light speed.

The attack is made so quickly that human reactions cannot even perceive it.
But Saber repels it like nothing.

"Very well. You will disappear first, Rider."
A heavy pressure fills the cavern.
A cruel smile on her face, the black swordsman starts to move.
Her vision spreads out.
The instant Tohsaka Rin escapes the darkness, she forgets that she's deep underground.

The impossibly high canopy and black sun.
The huge cavern isn't a cave, but a desolate land.
There should be two, no, three kilometers across.
In the distance stands a monolithic wall.
...This is the start and the end of this war.
There should be a giant crater above the cliff.
Up there is the system that has been activated for two hundred years.

The massive rock that holds a large magic circle, the Great Holy Grail, belches black fire from its mortar-shaped center.

The embryonic movements of the black shadow.
The light illuminating the desert is a wave of magical energy.
...According to Tohsaka's records, this is what you'd call the altar of the beginning.
The middle that leads to the middle.
The circular circuit, the world of heart, Heavens Feel.
It has immeasurable magical energy, creating an alien world that lives up to its name.

"That's Angra Manyu... So the name 'all evils of this world' isn't just for show, huh?"
Rin talks lightly as she makes her way to the altar.
...She's worried about Shirou and Rider, but her situation isn't too good either.
The magical energy in the Great Holy Grail isn't something a human can handle.

The vortex of magical energy can be called infinite.
There's so much that it won't run out, not even if all the magi in the world come here and use whatever magic they wish.
It's more than anyone can use in a lifetime, and therefore can be called infinite.

"...Nothing is impossible, huh? That Holy Grail really can make any wish come true."
Her determination almost breaks, faced with the numbing premonition of death.
Keeping her spirits up with idle talk, she walks on.

The ones she's watching out for are Assassin and Matou Zouken.
Matou Sakura isn't a threat.
She has lost her mind, and Rin sees no danger from her.
She's just Zouken's puppet, after all.
Rin's greatest enemy is Matou Zouken.
The fight against Matou Sakura isn't important.

"......Strange. I can make it to the altar."
Zouken shouldn't allow an intruder to trespass this far.
If he's planning to attack her, it'll be on the way to the altar.
But it's not happening, and Rin's about to reach her destination.


She thinks.
Why is there no interference from Zouken?  Why can't she feel his or Assassin's presence?
She makes a guess.
She denies the possibility, but easily accepts it.
No, she's forced to accept it.
Because...

"I'm glad, Nee-san. You came here instead of running away."

...Her guess turns out to be true.

She looks up.
On top of the cliff.
With the black sun behind her, Matou Sakura welcomes her older sister.

"!"
Rin retreats a little, overwhelmed by the pressure.
...The girl has been transfigured further than Rin expected.
Angra Manyu is a Servant without form.
It's only a shadow that takes form using people's wishes.
Therefore, its powers depend on its Master.

Matou Sakura is now Angra Manyu.
"All evils of this world", the function to emit the curse is the girl called Matou Sakura.

"...Crap. If Kirei were here, I bet he'd call it a messenger from God."
Rin looks up at Sakura, who has turned into a bottomless well of magical energy, and releases her gem sword.
But is it something that can match the being above her?

There are two functions for weapons that support magic and ceremonial equipment that assist in rituals.
One function is to amplify.
It's a backup, increasing and supplementing one's magical energy and strengthening the spell itself.
These items are considered orthodox support equipment, and magi carry at least one. Rin's jewels are classified in this group.

Another is a limited function.
It's a special magical item where the weapon itself becomes magic.
It's activated using the magical energy of the magus and performs a predetermined divine mystery.
Its greatest advantage is that it enables the magus to use magic she's not capable of ordinarily.

It only has one application and thus lacks versatility, but for that reason, its power is immense.
A lance that always pierces the heart, a bridle that enslaves holy beasts, a dagger that cancels any magical effect.
Noble Phantasms of Servants are usually classified in this group.


So, which is the gem sword?
Is it support equipment that gives magical energy to the user, or is it a limited weapon that defeats the enemy with its unique ability?
...But.
No matter which it may be, nothing should be able to match Matou Sakura.

The difference in their magical energy is too vast.
No matter what kind of a magic it may be, Matou Sakura should be able to drive it back in one breath.

"What's wrong, why are you trembling, Nee-san? ...Fufu, don't tell me you've suddenly lost your nerve."
"...Well said. Where's your guardian? You're a coward, so doesn't it bother you that he's not by your side?"

...The air freezes.
Hostile tension mixes into the warm air in the cavern.


The black girl bites her lip and sighs.
"Grandfather's gone. He was a bother, so I crushed him along with Assassin."
She smiles gracefully.

"......"
She doesn't need to ask.
Matou Zouken was killed by Matou Sakura.
...It's natural that he hasn't shown himself.
The old magus was eaten by his own pet dog.

"I see, so you're completely free. Zouken bound you in a good way and a bad way.
 You don't have anything to fear now that you killed him."
"Not quite. Not yet, Nee-san.
 Killing my grandfather isn't enough. I'm this strong and I can do anything, but I'm still bound."

"...Geez. Nee-san, you're so insignificant, but you won't disappear from within me. You still torment me in my mind.
 Soas long as you live, I can't be free."

Her voice is a light singsong, but the words are heavy as slime.
The contradiction proves her madness.
The hostility in the cavern is a rhapsody of superiority and awe.

"...Oh. But you seem happy in spite of that. You killed Zouken and Assassin, so I should assume you killed Kirei as well.
 What a performance for someone who hated killing... are you getting used to murder now?"

"Yes. Crushing people and eating them are no different.
 For people, it's boring and meaningless if you don't have fun, and it's painful if you don't eat, right?
 It's just the same. I'm the same as you. I'm just doing what everyone else's doing."

"Wait. Do you really mean that twisted logic?"
"It's not twisted logic. I'm not wrong.
 It's different because I've gotten strong. I'm strong, so I'm different now."

"II'm strong. Everything's forgiven if you're strong.
 ...Yes. If I'm strong and no one can beat me, everything I've done will be forgiven. If I'm not myself, everything I've done couldn't be helped...!"

A scream of rage.
It's the complaint of a petulant child who can't escape unless she believes in it.

"Do you understand, Nee-san? That's what I'm going to become. That's why I can kill anyone. It's natural for me."
"......I see. So you're going to take it out on everything you see? But what about Shirou? He still believes he can save you. Are you going to kill him too?"

"!"
The girl stiffens.
Rin's question is her last obstacle.
...Her excitement cools down.
Thinking about him, she regains her sanity.

A serene smile crosses her face.
"Yes. Senpai's no exception.
 Nohe's the only one I want to kill, Nee-san.
 ...Yes. I quickly"

      Want to consume Senpai.


Matou Sakura's reply shows that she is beyond help.
Rin grips the gem sword and gauges the distance between them.

"...Hmph. What about taking Angra Manyu with you?
 I knew you were stupid, but I didn't think you were this stupid. You let yourself be swallowed, and you've already stopped being human."
A voice filled with clear hostility.
As the supervisor of this land, Tohsaka Rin acknowledges her own sister as "evil".

"Fuh. You're bluffing. Please be honest with yourself, Nee-san.
 You're envious of this great power, right? You're jealous, right? That's why you came to kill me even though you can't.
 ......Yes. You're going to take him away from me so you can keep the happiness to yourself."

The shadows stand up.
A magic of absorption, a bundle of magical energy that matches a Servant's Noble Phantasm.
Not one, but many rise up to attack.

"I won't give it to you. This is my power. All I'm going to give you is regret and despair.
 I'll slowly show you what I mean."
There are four figures.
They reach out for the small person beneath them like giants protecting the girl.

"I'll show you the difference in our powers, Nee-san.
 Nobody's going to come help you this time. You can drown in me like a bug in a lake."
The towering shadows attack her.
A titanic power that can neither be blocked nor dodged swallows Tohsaka Rin.
"Sakura."
She calls out and throws it.

Her strongest weapon.
She throws the sorcerer's inheritance.
"Welt, Ende."
The whole cavern is filled with light.

Explosion.
In the act of its own destruction, the miraculous gem sword erases all shadows.

She runs.
She runs straight at Matou Sakura.
Sakura can't move, wincing from the light.
No matter how much power she has, she's still inexperienced in battle.
So it's easy to beat her once she sets her mind to it.

Tohsaka Rin quickly closes in.
As she runs, she grasps another dagger hidden behind her back.


Sakura can't react.
It seems she's realized she's going to be killed, but it's too late.

...She's got her.
She thrusts the dagger to finish her off, Oh, I can't.
and realizes her own defeat.

'...I'm dead.'
She understands that the dagger will pierce her heart before she can dodge it.
Her body tries to counterattack, but it won't make it in time.

'I'm going to be killed.'

There's no fear.
She's used to being hurt by others.
And she thinks it's natural that Rin is the one doing it.

But she doesn't like getting hurt and dying scares her, so she closes her eyes.
She sighs with relief; after all, once she dies, the pain will end.

"?"
But there's no pain, and the end doesn't come.
Warmth fills her instead.
The instant she realizes what it is...
Matou Sakura regains her sight.

...There's blood.
Warm, human blood, flowing from the stomach.
The blood's flowing out of her older sister, whose arms are firmly wrapped around her.

"...Nee-san?"
The girl asks why.
Rin was definitely faster.
She could've killed her, but she stopped her dagger at the last second.

"......Geez. I can't be complaining about Shirou."
A faint voice.
It's the voice she's always dreamed of.
The voice of Tohsaka Rin that's relentless, but warm and kind.

Rin thinks to herself.
...It's nothing special.
She just realized when it counted the most.
Right when she saw Sakura up close, she realized she couldn't kill her.

"......Geez. I'm stupid."
...She's dumbfounded.
Her foolishness must be absolute if she doesn't realize it until the very last moment.
She should've realized it earlier.
...But Rin's convinced that it can't be helped.

"...Yeah, it can't be helped.
 I can't ignore a slouch. I like orderly schemes, and it irritates me when people aren't repaid for their efforts."

And first of all...

"I like you, Sakura. I've always watched you, and I wanted you to smile. ...Yeah. I wanted to believe that you had it better the more I suffered.
 I was so preoccupied with that, so I didn't even have time to think about if it was painful or not."

She embraces Sakura with love.
A once-in-a-lifetime embrace between sisters.
She softly embraces her sister, who pierced her stomach, and holds her there like a treasure.

"Neesan"
......Her warmth fades.
There's no complaint.
Tohsaka Rin regrets, not her death, but her inability to save her sister.

"I'm sorry I'm a selfish sister.
 ...And thanks. I'm glad you always wore that ribbon."
She crumples to the altar like a falling red flower.

"Ah."
The weight disappears.
It only lasted for an instant. Her older sister disappears along with the warmth.

But Sakura. Even as insensitive as I am...
       I never thought I was blessed

"No."
What kind of loneliness is contained in Sakura's words?
Her agony for her alone.
Nobody else can understand or relieve her.
There's no such hypocrisy.

And at the same time...
What if the girl she admired felt a loneliness nobody could understand?

"No."
...What would happen then?
She was her ideal. Someone brimming with confidence, who had everything she wanted.
What if her older sister were always bound by something, just like her?

"I"
...Then...
The one that's weak, the one at fault, isn't her world...
...But her, the coward who couldn't look up
And there were people who clumsily loved her.

"ButI destroyed them."

...Where did she go wrong?
She had everything.
Everything she wanted was actually right there in front of her.
They loved her and embraced her so kindly.
But she destroyed it all herself.

"Ah.
 Ahh, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh......!!!!!!!"

Her hands are still frozen in place, trying to hug someone who's no longer there.
The girl, wet with her beloved sister's blood, starts to strongly curse herself.
...I hear sounds.
A rumbling shakes the cave.
The light and sound are still far off, but the cavern's creaking and trembling.

Is it distant thunder?
Suddenly I realize that I can't recall when I've ever heard distant thunder.

...The dagger in my hand crumbles away as Saber disappears.
It must be because I eliminated a Servant, a strong familiar.
The Azoth Sword Tohsaka created with all her magical energy crumbles away without a trace.


I tighten the restraint on my left arm.
I've used up most of the magical energy.
What's left in Archer's arm and myself.
I should be able to do more if I combine them, but I can only manage one more projection. I won't be able to suppress Archer's arm after that.

"Ri... der."
That's right. What happened to her?
I get up.

My body's stiff and rigid.
It feels like my joints have turned into steel.
I could probably repel bullets now.

"Are you all right, Rider?"
I can't walk well.
I walk.

Blood comes out.
Something's coming out of my bent legs.
I pretend not to notice.
It feels like a metal pipe's protruding from my leg, but I can manage to walk if I grit my teeth.

...Something's making a sound in the distance.
It sounds like something I heard a lot as a kid.
It's probably still ingrained in my childhood memories.
One gets curious about a lot of things as a kid.

"Rider."
I walk to the wall Rider smashed into.
She's still there.
But she's covered in wounds, with her magical energy almost completely depleted.
She shouldn't be able to move for a while.
...I should have her rest.

"I'm going ahead. Please come after me once you can run again."
I murmur to Rider and start walking.

"Ugh. ...You treat people more roughly than I expected."
Oh, she's conscious.
Unable to stand, she watches me in a daze.

"Sorry. But I'm counting on you. Please come help me after you're slightly healed."
"Yes. Don't worry, I shall follow you shortly."

Rider doesn't push herself.
She knows she should start moving after she heals instead of pushing herself now.
I can depend on her because she actually thinks ahead, unlike me.

...The rumblings are coming at shorter intervals now.
There's no time to waste.
I drag my wounded body and follow after Tohsaka.

"Haa, haa, ha, haa"
I'm breathing hard.
I lean against the wall as I walk.
I'm not making bad progress.
My body's stiff, but it's nothing once I get used to it.

"Guhha, gah."
Something comes out of my mouth.
I wipe it away and pretend nothing happened.

"Guh, ah"
My thigh muscle goes numb, and I almost fall.
It's just a little numbness.
My pants leg is ripped from inside, and I can see inside my body.
Desperately, I look away and walk on.

I'm almost there.
Warm wind hits my body.
"All right."
I slap my cheeks and start running.

I burst out of the darkness.
The familiar deserted land fills my vision.
No.
This isn't something I've seen.
That thing didn't exist in Ilya's memory.

"So that's..."
The main cause of this ridiculous war.
The guy who took Sakura from me.

"It's about to be born."
Pressure and unpleasantness hit my whole body.
The breathing of life tells me it's about to hatch.

A flash of light and a rumble.
The light came from the top of the cliff, wreaking havoc on the cavern.
...I don't know what's going on, but such flashy things can only come from Tohsaka.

Then that means
"You're in a rush."
The distorted embryo looks at me, even though it has no eyes.

...There's no mistake about it.
He wants to come out right this second, maybe because he doesn't like how Tohsaka's raging around.
But his body's not ready yet.
His placenta is inside the black pillar.
He can't come out until his body's completely formed.

He's impatient because Tohsaka's about to destroy the womb itself, and that's why he wants his body completed, even if it may be hurriedly built.
He wants to be summoned into this world as a Servant with a body.

"Fuck that."
I run.
A desperate clash of light and shadow.

"Sakura?"
Once I'm close enough to tell that it's the battle between Tohsaka and Sakura...
The time in this cavern stops.
I can only think of one possible cause of the great light.

'Nee-san'
With a childish cry, the world starts to quake.

This isn't the destruction of the cavern walls by the light.
This is destruction on a more fundamental level. The cavern is shaking because the giant shadow's trying to come out.

"That's"
A chill runs up my spine.
I get a bad feeling.
Hearing Sakura's cry, I imagine the worst possible outcome.

"TohsakaTohsaka, Tohsaka!"
I run.
Panting frantically, I scramble up the cliff on all fours.

The tremor doesn't stop.
I hear a large boulder crash to the ground somewhere in the cavern.

"HaaHaa, haa, haa, ha!"
I don't care what's happening behind me.
I run in desperation, covering myself in dirt.
...And my eyes are seared with the fact that I was too late.

"Tohsaka."
...The ground's shaking.
I can't see Tohsaka's face, since she's lying face down.
She looks like a large flower, fallen from its stem.

"..............., .........Sen... pai..."
I raise my face.
Backing away from Tohsaka's blood-soaked body, as if fleeing, is
...Sakura, cursing her own existence.
"Sakura."
"......I killed her.  Nee-san cared about me, but I killed her"

Sakura's voice isn't directed at me.
She's rejecting everything.
Her own body, covered in Tohsaka's blood, her darkened self, the pillar connected to her.
She's cursing everything with all her might.

"I was stupid. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There's nothing but pain. You always told me not to lose, but I was too stupid to understand. Senpai believed in me, but I just kept betraying him"

The shadow's binding Sakura.
The black Command Spell's binding Sakura's body.

"......No... I have to stop... But I can't go backno, no, I don't want this!"

She's refusing it.
Sakura's refusing the shadow.
She's hating herself, refusing the temptations from the shadow, and trying to kill herself.

But she can't.
Sakura's necessary as a host for the shadow.
It won't allow her to take her own life.
Sakura's being torn apart by both the shadow and her own guilty conscience.


...So Tohsaka won.
Sakura regained her sanity.
Tohsaka chose her sister's life in the very end.

Sakura's Sakura.
Her heart doesn't change, no matter how much the shadow swallows her.
...I'm the one who made her like that.
This would never have happened if I hadn't gotten scared back then and scolded her.

"!"
I run to Tohsaka.
She's still breathing.
It's too early to give up.

"Sakura. Tohsaka's still alive."
"?"

"Right, she's not dead. She can be saved. No, she has to be saved. We have to save her. Right, Sakura?"

"Aheh?"
Light returns to her eyes.
The restraint of the shadow loosens a bit.

Her eyes focusing on us, Sakura finally sighs with relief, "! No, run, Senpai!"
and frantically tries to control herself.

"! !"
Covering Tohsaka's body with my own, I receive the shadow's blow on my back.
"Ahno, Senpai. I, I......!"

The shadows come up behind Sakura.
......Damn it.
He's not alive yet, but his sense of danger's first-class?

"I know. It's that kid's fault for not giving up. He's throwing a tantrum because he doesn't want you taken away.
 Hold on. I'll smack him and get him off of you."
I start walking towards Sakura.

"Noplease stop, Senpai!"
The shadow grazes my cheek.
It should've cut through my neck, but Sakura's scream made it miss.

"Haaah, ah, uh......!"
Clutching at herself, Sakura fights against it.
Instead of disappearing, the shadows keep increasing in number.

"Uh... uhh, uhhhh..."
She's crying.
Sakura's crying.
It's not because of the pain of the shadow swallowing her.
She's crying from frustration because she can't suppress herself.

"......No, Senpai. I can't suppress it. Nee-san taught me, but I'm going to lose. ...I wasn't strong. I'm a coward, a wimp, and a terrible person."
Another step.
The shadow's lance grazes my cheek.

"! No, why are you coming, Senpai...!?
 I'll kill you if you come any closer...!"
Another step.
I put my right hand on my left shoulder.

"Why? Run. Please run, Senpai. Please take Nee-san and run...!
 You can forget about me...! I'll, I'll die here! I can die by myself...! I don't want you to see me like this...!"

The shadow's pressure gets stronger with each step.
My advance is hurting Sakura's body and mind.

"Why aren't you listening to me...!?
 I won't hold back if you're going to come any closer. I'll kill you before you kill me...!"
"I don't need to explain. I'm going to get you out of here and save Tohsaka. That's what I said, right?"

"Are you still going on about that?
 ...Don't. I can't be saved. No, I shouldn't be saved. I shouldn't live."

Another step.
"!"
The shadow hits my stomach.
...It didn't pierce me. It's just a strike.
Sakura's intentionally trying to push me away.

"See, you saw that. This is how I am. I can't go back, and he's not going to let me go.
 Andeven if I do go back..."

"...I've killed a lot of people. I killed many people, killed Nii-san, killed Grandfather, and killed Nee-san...!
 WhatWhat do you want me to do...!? I can't give back what I've taken. I've killed many people. Are you still telling me to live...!?"


...I see.
She can't back out now.
She's trapped by crimes she can't atone for.

There's no salvation.
Even if it wasn't Sakura's will, those actions will haunt her forever.
Even if she's released from the shadow, the darkness will remain within her.
But.

"Of course. You took lives, so take responsibility, Sakura."

I release the restraint on my left arm.
The last time. I remove the red cloth that barely kept me alive.

...I feel faint.
I have to go forward before I disappear.
There are things I have to tell her.

"Sen... pai."
"Yes. I don't know where the crime is, or how heavy it is."
"......!"
The shadows lance toward my chest, shoulder, left leg, and stomach.
Clank.
The shadows don't pierce me, but slide off with a spark.

"But I'll protect you. I'll protect you from everything.
 It may be hypocrisy, but my ideal has always been to protect the one I love"
I move forward.
Sakura's right in front of me now.

"NoSenpai, your body's..."
......Trace, on.
I only think about one thing.
I use every last ounce of my remaining magical energy for its projection.

The last projection.
I raise the dagger that breaks all contracts.
I can't see her face clearly.

"Sen, pai."
"I'm going to punish you. This is gonna be harsh, so grit your teeth."

I hear her gasp.
Then.
With a "yes", Sakura holds out her chest

Hoping this will be her punishment...

"Let's go home, Sakura. Cut your ties with him."

  And I thrust it into her heart with a single breath.
Everything's falling apart.
The collapse is definitive.
The search that took the Einzbern a thousand years.
The earnest desire that took the Makiri five hundred years.
The continuous world that was never completed is about to end.

"OhOh, ohhhhhhh."
Amidst the chaos, it is still conscious.

   I don't want to die

The body's a mere collection of dark red flesh, bearing no resemblance to a human being.
The swarm of worms fills the cavern.
It cannot maintain its body, even when using all of the worms.

"Oh, ohhh, oh, oh"
The writhing figure is just a moving pile of meat.
But it's alive.
The mass curses its rotting, melting body.

   I don't want to die

Its obsession is the only thing keeping it in this world.

"OhhOhh, ohoh"
It crawls.
Makiri Zouken. The old magus, his soul's vessel destroyed, remains in this world only through sheer force of will.
But it's only a matter of time before he dies.
He stuffed his rotting soul into a hurriedly-constructed worm, but he can't heal his wounds after being killed twice.

   I don't want to die

The old magus has turned into a pile of flesh, and will die after going through immense pain.
He'll rot until the very end and die in regret.
With his earnest desire in front of him.
What he yearned for, what he was about to obtain.

"OhOhh, ohhhhh."
Is his dying cry from pain or anguish?

   I don't want to die

He doesn't want to die.
How can he just disappear?
Five hundred years.
The result he achieved after five hundred years, the reward he deserves, is right in front of him, so why does he have to disappear?

"OhOh, ohhhhhhhhhhhh."
He only recalls pain.
Makiri's karma.
A noble family of magi that was driven out of their homeland and declined in this far eastern country, unable to familiarize themselves with the rules of the foreign land.
But that's wrong.
If that were the case, salvation would be possible.
If that were the reason for his bloodline's end, he may have accepted fate.

   I don't want to die

But that's not why.
It's not that the Japanese soil didn't suit them.
The Makiri didn't die out because of an external factor.
They merely dropped out.

It has been three hundred years since the start of their search.
Three hundred years was their limit.
The family died out in Zouken's generation.
The suffering started there, and the old man could do nothing but deny the truth.
Matou Zouken's life was a frantic protest against the end of the Makiri bloodline.

   I don't want to die
I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die I don't want to die I don't want to die I don't want to die......!!!!!

"Oh, ohh, ohhhhhhh......!!!!"
Right, dying's not possible. The rotting body. It's painful. Nothing but pain. The five hundred years were filled with pain. Pain filled the whole life. So what's so bad about seeking eternity? Suffering without satisfaction. Can't disappear without leaving anything behind. The Holy Grail is right there. Grant the wish. The answer being "not wanting to die". The wish will come true on top of the cliff. But it's impossible with this body. This short distance is nothing compared to five hundred years. So why is it so far away!!!!?

"Oh, ohh, oh, oh"
The meat crawls across the floor, leaving bits of itself behind.
Such tenacity.
It should have no function to move, but it moves forward with tenacity.

A thought that's filled only with obsession.
Ignoring the impending collapse, it moves forward to the Holy Grail.
But someone calls out to the hideous monster.
"You have changed, Makiri."
A bell-like, beautiful voice.

"What?"
He looks up.
Within the blur.
Stands a girl.


The flesh stops moving forward.
It looks up at the girl in astonishment.
...The old magus doesn't see her.
A woman deep in his memory.
Einzbern's golden saint, who has stayed in his mind without fading.
Two hundred years ago.
His partner sacrificed herself to create the Great Holy Grail.


It hasn't faded at all.
The holy woman still has the eyes he adores.
"I ask of you, my foe. Why do you not want to die?"
And the girl lets out a familiar voice.


The pure question shields his mind from the pain.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Now that she asks him, it is strange.
Why doesn't he want to die?
Why shouldn't he die?
Dying means escaping the pain, so why did he cling onto life along with all the pain involved?

"OhOhh, ohhhh."
He remembers.

Yes. In the beginning, he had a supreme goal.
To obtain all creation.
To obtain all knowledge.
To reach where no man can reach.
To exceed the limits of the body and reach the infinity we call the soul.

The species called humanity has set limits.
To go outside the spiral of the brain.
To eliminate and cure all hatred and suffering.

He remembers.
The grief of finding out there's no such thing as paradise.
If it doesn't exist in this world, if its creation is impossible with a human body, he inspired himself to go to a place where it can be done.
Not to make a new world, but to change his human life.

"OhOh."
...That's right.
To the sky, to the limits.
Be reborn and reach the unimaginable land.
The ideal utopia.

It is for that reason.
That's why he sought the Holy Grail.
He sought a miracle beyond human reach.
He can't disappear until he makes it reality.
He couldn't give up, no matter how many times he was beaten, no matter how often he was shown that he could not reach it.

   There's only one thing he dreamed of.
             To eliminate all evils of this world.
             They risked their lives for an ideal that couldn't come true.

"Oh"
That's why he remained.
He kept seeking even after his enemies died, knowing it was meaningless.
He believed he had a reason to exist, and that his existence would bring on a successor.

That's why he continued to live.
He can't die, no matter how much it hurts him.
He wanted to overthrow the youthful anguish he felt when he was young.
That was his way of life: the answer he came up with.

...Yes.
Even if his life is not compensated for.

"OhOhh, oh......!"
That was his first wish.
The pain.
How small is the wish of not wanting to die, compared to pursuing a wish that will not come true...!?

"I see. You're right, Justizia."
...He looks up at the world.
The cavern's collapsing.
Matou Sakura has been released and taken out of this small world.
The Third Sorcery that was created by mistake, Angra Manyu, is flickering like a heat haze.
And...
The old magus accepts that everything is out of his reach.

"So this is it.
 My desire, my pain, Makiri's missioneverything ends here."
This end was determined at the start.
This is all that Makiri's journey can accomplish, no matter where it ends.

"HaHaha, hahaha."
But.
In no way is it a miserable end to a life filled with pain.

It's probably just a start.
His journey is just starting.
Five hundred years is nothing.
How can it be reached in a mere five hundred years?
What they wished for is distant, dazzling, sacred... something that will come true in the distant future.
A growth of the human species that will come after many years, thousands of years, tens of thousands of years.

So this is a trifling, but meaningful matter to start the journey.
It's not that their desire ends here.
The journey starts here.
The history to reach the distance starts its loop with an end of a dream.

"But how disappointing. My, I was almost there."
The voice is that of the old magus.
No matter what light he sought, he's a heretic who approved of wrongdoing.
Not hiding it until the very end, he cuts his attachment to life.

The last one disappears.
One of the magi that sought a miracle, the observer that also started everything, rots away.

"Five hundred yearshah. Come to think of it, it was a desire that only lasted for an instant."
The pile of flesh is buried without trace by the crumbling rocks.

The one that lived on, taking many forms.
Every last trace of the magus vanishes from the world, as the embodiment of his desire is destroyed.


His palm slams against me.
It doesn't matter what my body's made of.
The attack's meant to damage inside me, so the impact mercilessly pierces through me.

I'm overwhelmed in this battle.
My fists are dodged and parried, while his attacks land cleanly.
Every time his fists hit me, my vision whites out.

It's not because of the damage, but because of the pain brought on by my left arm which tries to heal and overwrite my wounded body.



I protect my head.
My face hasn't turned into swords yet.
It'll be over if I'm hit there.
I can't manage to strike him, so I put everything into fending off his attacks to my head.

My sense of pain's already numbed, and my vision will be cut off soon.
The only pain my brain can sense is the invasion from my left arm.
His bloody fists pulverize my body.
My left arm frantically tries to repair me, and consequently

Everything turns white.
My vision and mind turn too white to be recovered.



Even thinking brings pain now.
As my body is destroyed, swords are created, trying to keep it alive.
In exchange, my brain continues to be ground away.
I don't know which one of us will die first.

"Guh, fu......!"
The bones in his fists are destroyed.
He bears it with an agonized expression and keeps up the assault.



I dodge and swing my right fist.
It's repelled.
A jolt runs through my left rib. I resist the swords stabbing my brain and punch again.



I can still move.
I can still move, I can't move, this is my la-

"Ah."

"Ah"

That hurt. That one hurt.
I shouldn't feel any pain, but my body's about to cry out from it.
Flung like a rag doll, my body hits a large piece of rubble, narrowly avoiding falling off the cliff.

"Ah."

"Ah."


I can't get up.
If the impact hurts this much, the pain to reinforce my body would be beyond imagination.

I'll go crazy.
I'll burn out, unable to bear the pain.
But if I go to sleep before that...
If I close my eyes...

"So this is the end. Then I shall crush your head."
The enemy walks to me.
...He can't run either.
Both of us might disappear within the next minute.
Then

"Ah."

What did you swear?
Who did you swear to protect?

"Ah."

Live.
She said she won't be saved unless both of you are alive.

"Ah, ah."

What did you lose?
What did you lose in exchange?

"Ah, ahh"

The enemy comes closer.
He drags his legs, trying to get close enough to crush my skull.

No way......!
I won't lose! That man has no goal! He's just following his way of life he protected...!
But I have one.
I have a goal.
I have a reason that I have to beat him, a reason that I have to win!

"Ahh, ahah."
I don't know how much I made       cry.
       was crying where I couldn't see her.
She only smiled in front of me, and always cried by herself.

"Ahoh."
...Yes.
So I have to protect her.
The crimes        committed, the crimes that condemn      , the crimes        remembers. I have to protect her from everything.

The girl that could only smile in front of me.
Her body was dying, but she still said she'd protect me

So she can eventually smile in front of other people.

You're getting in the way of that.
"AhAhh, ah"
Get lost.
Sakura can't smile if you exist!

"Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!"

"Guhnu!?"
"Ah, ahhhhhh!!"
One blow.
I punch my enemy in the face with everything I have.

"You, still!"
"Kotomine, Kirei!"
Two blows.

Three blows.

Four blows.

Five blows.

Six blows.

Seven blows!

"Haa, haa, ha, gah!!!!!!!!"
I punch, I punch, I punch, I punch......!!
This is it. There's nothing left if I miss this chance. I put all of my remaining life into this miraculous chance!

", Ah......!!!!"
I'm blown away.
He deflected my attack and counterattacked me with a hard shot.

"Ah, gah, guh!"
Damn! I know! ...He won't let me punch him that easily!
He's many times stronger than me, so he can easily fend off my attacks and come finish me off!

"Haah!"
Yeah, so what...!?
The difference in our powers won't change.
Things won't conveniently go right for me.
I'm blown away, and my enemy comes to smash my head.
I'll lose. I'll lose. I'll lose. I'll lose.
It's a self-evident truth.
But my body still moves!

"Kotomi-"
My enemy looms over me.
My legs don't moveyeah, my right leg really doesn't move at allbut I fire them up to raise my body.

I won't die here.
I can't avoid the enemy's attack with these legs.
In desperation, I try to evade the death coming in the next second and

"ne?"
The guy in front of me didn't make it.
He's standing in front of me with an upraised fist.

"...This is how it ends.  A simple difference in time."
He looks down at his chest.
The black stain is right where his heart should be.
...The difference in time.
So he became half-dead in the forest a bit before I did.

"You win, Emiya Shirou. I don't know how many more seconds that body will last you, but you must hurry if you need to do something."
He's just like before.
He sounds uninterested in anything, just like when I first met him at the church.

"Kotomine."
"You are the last Master.
 Go to the Holy Grail and fulfill your wish."

The last Master.
The words contain deep weight, but the priest still sounds the same.
It's natural.
This man won't change, even on the verge of his death.
He continues to be my despicable enemy.

"Yeah, this is for hurting me so much. I'm going to mercilessly destroy your wish."


Did he smile in his last moment?
On the verge of rusting away, my eyes no longer serve their purpose.
The priest disappears from this world, with no one to bury him.
The last Tiger Dojo was the final one.
Please click and return to the title screen.

Extra stage!

Side A!!

How's everyone doing? Are you dying without mercy?
This is Tiger Dojo Remix that saves you from simple choice mistakes!

Osu! Our battle just started.

Oh, don't say that. We'll get cut off if you say that line.

Well, Sakura-chan's route is about to enter its climax.
You can't be beaten when Tohsaka-san's in a big pinch!

That's right. Shirou can't beat Saber, so trust Rider and concentrate on your part!

Yup. Shirou's role is rearguard support. Watch over the fight from a distance and take the best part!

...But the story's getting really fancy. It's taking place underground, and Sakura-chan powered up a lot.

Oh, where are you going, "Fate"?

Yeah, you're right, master. I thought I could take a big part in this route, but Sakura's my rival.

I wasn't even a match against her, so I'm forced to come back to this dojo.

Ohh, what a tragic story...

So it's true that a bullied child is strong. The Tohsaka sisters are fearsome indeed. So they were both devils...

Yeah. I hate how everyone was putting their masks on.
Saber's gone black and merciless. Rin's cruel now when it counts.

I feel sorry for Shirou. I'm the only heroine that's not a two-faced person.

......Well, you certainly aren't a two-faced person...

Well, let's get on to the usual hint.
Sakura-chan route, "Heavens feel", has two endings.

One is the grand finale, the true ending of "Fate/stay night"!

True and normal ends.

Well, you can easily get to the normal end.
The condition for the true ending depends on what you've done until now.

To come out with it, you can't get to the true end if my affection points are below four or if you've used projection one too many times!

Cheeeeest! Don't spoil!

Ouuuu... Come on, this is the last one, so you should let me!

No! This is the last stronghold in "Fate"!
But we'll tell you up-front.  You can do something about Ilya-chan's affection score if you start over from Day 14!

Hey, you're coming out with it too!

Eh? But this is the Q&A. Our reason for existence is to give out hints.

I see. I don't get how it's different from a spoiler, but you're a tyrant, master.

What, you finally realized it in the 39th dojo!?

Well, the next one will be the final Tiger Dojo.
The long story's finally wrapping up.

The last bad end is rumored to be an erotic harem route, as expected from a mature-rated game!
Please keep your expectations up and keep up your indecisiveness!
Extra stage!

Side B!

Sorry to keep you waiting! Wanting her, her, and everyone else! This the only harem end in "Fate"!

All right! An erotic development that will keep you in animalistic passion for life awaits you

Wait, how is this a harem end!?

......Ouu... So am I stretching it a bit too far, master?

Geez, you can't do anything suspenseful like this!

 I love having monsters you had a hard time killing come back after the ending credits and "fin" come up.

Like the blob.

Oh, Senpai. Long time no see.

Geez. This is all because you were confined by lingering affection.
You can only save one. That's the decision you made coming into the final battle, so stick with it no matter what.

Osu, that's splendid, master.
...But are you sure there's no ending to save Saber?

Play the Saber route.

You're brutally honest, but that's exactly right.

There's no ending in Sakura-chan's route to make Saber-chan happy, so all you Saber-chan supporters can give up.

Well, the Tiger Dojo is really finished.
There're forty dojos total, so thanks for bearing with us.

Wow, there's that many?
What happens if you collect all the stamps, Taiga?

You'll see after you collect them all.
The main story's about to end, so it might be fun to use the skip function and start over if you haven't seen a particular dojo.

Anyway, thanks for playing the game until now!
The main story's about to end, so please keep at it!

Yeah, thank you so much for everything until now! It was fun!
Goodbye! Let's meet again after you fully complete the game!

...I can't move from here.
I'm not obedient enough to follow her words and run away.
But I can't go after Berserker either.

I'm scared of going up against that monster.
But more than thatwhat can I do even if I go?

"Damnit."
I stand by myself in the dark.
...It's vexing, but I have no way to fight.
I can neither help Saber nor fight Berserker.
If there's anything I can do, it's run to a safe place right now.

"!?"
I hear unfamiliar noises from the top of the hillfrom the open area that Saber was flung into.

If I remember correctly, that's the foreigners' cemetery.
Saber and Berserker.
Their fight must still be going on.

"......!"
This is my final decision.
I
Tohsaka is right.
Saber drew Berserker away from here.
Then I should get away from this dangerous place and await Saber's return

"Haa... Haa... Haa..."
I passed the bridge from Shinto and ran straight home.
I never looked back as I ran.
I don't know if I was scared of the unknown pursuer or if I felt guilty for leaving Saber behind.
...Anyway, I desperately ran here.


...The living room is just as I left it.
The air has been motionless ever since Lancer attacked and Tohsaka came here.
I go near the restored window.
I find two small pieces of glass on the floor that Tohsaka must have overlooked.

"...There's no crack in the glass... I wonder how Tohsaka made up for these pieces."
I murmur to myself.
...I don't know why, but I don't feel like turning the lights on.
I hide in the darkness as if to hide my weakness.

"......"
What I should be thinking about.
What I should say.
I'm running away from these things.
...The people that were here until a few hours ago.
The people who were by my side until a few minutes ago.
I have to ask myself if it was right to leave them behind, but I can't bring myself to get out of the dark.

The wall clock points to three.
...It's been thirty minutes since then.
No matter who won, I'm sure the battle is over now.


I should go back.
When I raise my head to turn the lights on and cheer myself up...
A sharp pain runs through my left hand.

"...The Command Spell...?"
The color has faded from my Command Spell.
Even though the shape is still there, the bright light that proves I am Saber's Master has disappeared.
I understand instinctively what that means.
"Saber...!"
I follow my instinct and run out from the darkness.

I run outside.
I won't make it now.
I know I can't make it, but I start to run back...
And I'm stabbed in the heart by some unknown thing.

"       ,        "
...I can't hear too well.
I can tell there's someone in front of me, the one who stabbed my heart, but I can't see very clearly.

"       ?    ,     "
The one in front of me sneers and tells me I am stupid.
The one in front of me is laughing that I have no way of surviving without my Servant.

"Oh, ........"
...That's right.
Emiya Shirou will be killed the instant Saber is lost.
As I don't have a way to protect myself, I have no way to survive without Saber.

But I didn't realize that, and I secluded myself.
This is the result.
It doesn't matter if I'm in the house or if I run away somewhere.

"Guh"
...My mind starts to fade.
I don't care who it is or what I got stabbed by.
It doesn't matter if I die today or tomorrow.

Because...
The instant my Command Spell lost its brightness, my life was lost as well
I can't be a burden on Saber.
I can't do anything even if I follow them, and Saber should be able to run away if she's by herself.
Saber got Berserker away from here.
If she was protecting me, I can't stay in this dangerous place forever

"Haa... Haa... Haa..."
I passed the bridge from Shinto and ran straight home.
I never looked back as I ran.
I don't know if I was scared of the unknown pursuer or if I felt guilty for leaving Saber behind.
...Anyway, I desperately ran here.

Hi, this is the Tiger Dojo!
Since this is part II, everything has been changed...
...Huh?
It's not different at all!!!
Well, the game is in its second arc.
The shocking route of Tohsaka-san has started. Do you have anything to say, Ilya-chan?
Ouuu... I'm sorry I lied to you...
Yes. Repent of your misdeeds.
It does look like the title changed, but it's the same on the inside. Rather
...Everyone's jumping about in part II. Is someone trying to steal our roles?
Probably. Unlike me, you aren't that fascinating as a character.
We should put the focus on me and make Taiga a guest
Well, about this dead end!
Why did this happen, you rebel!?
It's because Shirou was a coward.
Oh, the killer is still unknown.
He was killed instantly once he left his house.
You should go on and fight Berserker since Archer is in fighting condition this time. You should get them back for defeating you before.
Oh, are you sure it'd go so well?
No matter which hero Archer may be, I don't think he's a big enough threat for me.
Hm. W-Well, we won't know unless we try.
We're not in Saber-chan's route this time.
Really? Then let's see what happens.
Let's see how a hastily-formed alliance fares against me.
Ugh... You're starting to show your true form, you devilish child.
By the way, I've been wondering for a long time. Can I ask you something, Ilya-chan?
How strong are you as a magus?
Are you as strong as Tohsaka-san?
Me? Hmm... Strictly speaking, I'm not a magus.
I'm more like Caster. I didn't study magic from the time I was born. But rather, I already knew magic at birth. Do you get the difference?
Hmm? I don't, and I don't want to know.
So in short, you're really a devil?
Fufufu. You sure say cute things once in a while.
I'll kill you if you say something so close to the truth.
Gyaaa! Her face is scary! Help me, God of Babylon!
...Geez, asking me such a boring question.
You'll eventually find out who I am whether you want to or not.
Well, let's continue on for Shirou.
The new fight is just starting. Don't go stumbling here! Quickly go back to Saber!

I look through the house.
I look everywhere someone could possibly be, including all the guest rooms, but I can't find Saber.

"Huh...? She's in that outfit, so you'd think it'd be easy to find her."
Even so, I can't find Saber anywhere.
I guess Servants can become spirits, but I can't turn her into one anyway.
No, first of all

"Even though they call me a Master, I don't know anything about her."
I don't understand who she is or how she exists.

The only thing I understand is...
That I'm confident I'll be able to win this strange war if I'm with her.

"She's not here either"
I've searched throughout the house.
It's a big house, but I didn't play hide-and-seek here with Fuji-Nee as a kid for nothing. I know the most efficient way to search this place.
If she's nowhere to be found after searching this much, then she should be in the dojo or in the shed.

"Huh?"
Saber is in the silent dojo.
But her appearance is different from yesterday's.
Sitting in a Japanese fashion on the wooden floor, she is not wearing her armor.
She has changed into refined clothes that suit her well, and is sitting silently.


...I lose my voice at the sight.
Sitting Japanese-style with her back straight and eyes closed, Saber looks beautiful.
Her state, melting into the silence, reminds me of pure water.


And that removes the final doubts within me.
Even if she is a Servant, I think she is holy.
SoI won't be led astray if I'm with her.

"Saber."
I call out.
Saber slowly opens her eyes and returns my gaze.

"You are awake, Shirou."
A calm voice.
Her voice, echoing through the dojo as if permeating it, is surprisingly suited to this place.

"Yeah. I just got up. What were you doing here?"
"I was resting. I cannot treat you, so I thought I'd make sure I was in perfect condition."

"!"
Saber looks at me as she speaks.
...Well, um...
I feel tension, different from the kind I felt with Tohsaka.

"Shirou? What is it? Could it be that your body is still...?"
"...! N-No, there's no problem...! I'm just perplexed for my own reasons, so don't worry...!"
I take a step back and shake my head.

"...?"
Looking away from Saber, who is tilting her head questioningly, I calm my pounding heart.

"...Calm down. What am I so tense about!?"
I take a deep breath.
...But it doesn't seem to die down quickly. In fact, I don't think it ever will.

"...Geez, why did she get changed...?"
I complain without meaning to.
Saber's clothes are so real that they make me conscious of her womanhood, whether I like it or not.

...She is terribly beautiful.
I thought I figured that out yesterday, but she really hits me with it now.
Perhaps her armor looked so surreal that I didn't notice yesterday.
But when she dresses like a girl, I'm flustered, as any healthy guy would be.

"Shirou."
I tense up the moment our eyes meet.
But I didn't look for her just to say nothing.
I'm troubled, but I can't stay quiet forever.


I make up my mind and talk to her.
It's something I should have asked her the moment we got back last night.
That if she really is my Servant....
And if she really is going to be joining this battle...
I look through the house.
I look everywhere someone could possibly be, including all the guest rooms, but I can't find Saber.

"Huh...? She's in that outfit, so you'd think it'd be easy to find her."
Even so, I can't find Saber anywhere.

I tense up the moment our eyes meet.
But I didn't look for her just to say nothing.
I'm troubled, but I can't stay quiet forever.

"All right.
 May I, Saber? It'll be the first time we sit down and talk"
I make up my mind and talk to her.

And then.
"Shirou. Before that, there is something I would like to address regarding last night."
"? All right, what is it?"

"It is about last night.
 You are my Master. It is troubling if you take such actions. Battle is my duty, so you must concentrate on your role."

"Last night?"
I think about what happened last night.
...Is she talking about the time I tried to pull her to safety when Archer attacked?

"...Hey. I can't help it. You were fighting, so that's the least I could do. It's only natural to help when your partner is in danger."

"Impossible. You do not understand what Servants are, yet you have so much faith in me already?"
Oh, wow. Saber looks really surprised.

"Well, we did shake hands. And you've helped me so many times already. It'd be pretty strange not to trust you."

Saber looks up at me in surprise.

"Uh... Did I have the wrong idea about our contract?"
I get nervous, so I ask.
Saber shakes her head.

"As a Servant, I appreciate your words.
 And I would have been dealt a fatal wound had you not stopped me. The method was not a good one, but your instruction was."

"...I see. That's good. I was desperate, but that was good, huh?"
"Yes. But please refrain from such actions next time. I can heal immediately even if I am wounded. But I have no way to heal you if you are wounded."

"Ugh... All right, I'll watch out. That was definitely reckless. I'll do better next time."
I don't know how I can do things better, but I should stop doing things so recklessly.
Then...

"Yes. That is a good reply, Master."
Was I acting that funny?
I think she smiled for a second.


I shake off my blush.
There's something more important right now.
It's something I should have asked her the moment we got back last night.
That if she really is my Servant....
And if she really is going to be joining this battle...
...Yeah.
I think I'll cause trouble if I walk around school with Saber.
I'll relax in this familiar club room.

"Yeah, I'll stay and watch if it's not going to be a bother, Fuji-Nee."
"All right. Well, I'm going to go teach, so you can relax here. Oh, you don't have to restrain yourself if you want to shoot. You're my student and you're better than most people."


...Yeah, she's not wrong.
I'm better than anyone when it comes to shooting arrows.

Even though I was away for a while, I'm sure I could get the same result I had when I used to come here.
But that's not because of my skill in archery.
I can hit the target like I do in my mind because of my everyday training in magic.

"That's not true, Fuji-Nee. I'm missing the 'endurance' part of accuracy, piercing strength, and endurance."

"What? Do you mean how you have to shoot more than 200 arrows a day and how everything else is just releasing the bow? You know boring things, Shirou."

"Hey, you should know this if you do archery.
 At any rate, I can't shoot if my mind isn't into it. I'm not prepared at all, so I don't know if I'll even hit the target."

"...Oh. But Shirou, shooting arrows every day isn't the only way to train.
 The endurance is good enough if you're training yourself. It's good to make a distinction, but it's also good to try to respect archery. It'll all be good if you just nod, so be honest once in a while."

Fuji-Nee disappears into the range.
Mitsuzuri comes in as if to take her place.

"Excuse me... Oh, why the upset face, Emiya?
 Oh, I bet Fujimura-Sensei scolded you, huh?"
"I guess so. She told me not to worry too much. Well, she's totally right."

"Oh, I see. I thought you quit because you didn't want to shoot anymore, but you still want to, huh? That's unexpected."

"It's unexpected? What? You thought I got bored with archery?"

"Yeah. You only missed the target once. You were freaking good ever since I joined the archery club. Your form was really beautiful and you looked like you didn't know how to miss.
 I thought you weren't happy about hitting the target because you're so good. You can get into the mentality without the bow, so I was annoyed that the bow might just be hindering you."


"Oh, did I guess right? I bet I did. Shooting is the mentality of shooting your mind, right? The arrow is not shot at the target, but shot at the mind of the shooter trying to hit the target.
 So you won't understand the mentality if you can't face yourself."

In other words, archery is a way to kill yourself.
It's trying to make yourself transparent and to become one with nature.
The eight stages of shooting, ashibumi, dozukuri, yugamae, uchiokoshi, hikiwake, kai, hanare, and zanshin, exist for that purpose

Kai: the unity of the self and the target.
Hanare: releasing the arrow which has become yourself, and the moment time stops.
Zanshin: the self that is shot to the target already knows "it will hit", and the action and the result become one to make the past and the future into a point.

It is only a way to train yourself according to set stages.
Yes.
Archery is similar to meditation in magic.

"Well, it's like preaching to the Buddha. Hitting the target is like a bonus in archery. Archery is more like a path to obtain the mentality. It's a path and not a technique.
 But to put it another way, you can't reach that mentality without bow and arrow."

"...I thought that was the boring part for you. We shoot arrows and feel it when we hit the target. We know hitting the target is only a technique, but we can't tell if we succeeded unless the arrow hits the mark."

"But you're the type that doesn't care where the arrow goes.
 ...Anyone can hit the target in archery. Disregarding bothersome things like the eight stages of shooting, anyone can hit the target if they pursue 'the technique to hit the target'.
 But they are only making the arrow hit the target with technique. Real shooting hits no matter how bad the shooter may be."

"I don't know. I go to the range so that I can hit the target."

"That's what I'm talking about. Isn't there a faster way than getting a bow and going into the range? First of all, the bow and arrow are unnecessary for you.
 You missed a target once before, right? I went to see how surprised you'd look, but you were acting normally."

"I asked you why, and you said 'I missed because I imagined for it to miss'.
 It didn't miss as a result, but you made it miss with your own will.
 That's when I thought that you're always imagining the arrow striking the target before you release it."

"Hm? What are you saying? That's just basics, right? Don't you imagine the arrow hitting the target and release it accordingly?"

"Of course. People try different things wishing for a good result. But it's only in our imagination. We can't 'see' it like you do, Emiya.
 It means you're one with nature. You've reached nothingness, to put it in martial arts terms."

...Hm.
I don't know if I'm really "seeing", but I can nod back to the nothingness part.
It is the strength of a magus to erase oneself to make the self into a circuit.
Making the self transparent and ridding oneself of attachments and wishes to only obtain the result.
The training of archery and magic are similar in regards to making the self into "nothing".

"That's difficult. So, what did you want to tell me?"

"It's just that it's easy for you to turn transparent because you're unselfish. You should be more selfish and greedy. It's boring to become a master at such a young age, right? I won't tell you to be like Shinji, but why don't you have some fun once in a while?"


I'm at a loss for words.
I think that's not true, but I can't think of anything that's fun for me.

"See. That's why you're troubling Sakura so much. You have to know how to have fun now, or you won't be able to when you get old.
 People call those kinds of people good-for-nothings, you know?"

"Man. has it become so bad that a classmate is worrying about when I get old? Why are you so worried about me?"
"Because you don't laugh, Emiya."
"Huh?"

"I'm talking about the training camp we had before. We were all laughing, but you didn't laugh even at my best jokes."
"...Hm. So..."

"Yup. I'm still holding a grudge from that time."
She declares as if smiling to a rival.
...I'll sneak out for a bit.
Issei might be there if I go to the student council room, and it wouldn't be a bad idea to start thinking up strategies for the final exam coming up in a month.

"All right. I'm going to go to the student council room. Do you know if Issei's here, Fuji-Nee?"
"Ryudou-kun? Hmm... I don't know. At the very least, I haven't seen him."

"I see. Well, I'll come back if he's not there. Tell Sakura that I give her my best regards."
"All right. But you're picking a male friend over a female friend? You're still just a boy, huh?"

"Hm."
...I want to object, but Saber will notice me if I do.
I'll let Fuji-Nee win this time, and I'll sneak out of here.

"You are walking strangely. Where are you going, Shirou?"
"Gah."

I guess sneaking out was useless.
I tried to leave in a way she wouldn't notice, but Saber is waiting for me outside.

"S-Saber. Um, well, I remembered that I had to do something..."
"Do something, huh? I believe your business here was only to deliver the lunch."

"Uh, um... It's minor business. I didn't think I needed to tell you, so I didn't."
"I see. If it is minor business, there is certainly no need to tell me. You do have your own life after all."

I'm glad she's so understanding.
...I'm glad, but is it because of my guilty conscience that she looks mad?

"...Um. So, can you wait here?
 I'll be back in an hour"

"But that was your lifestyle until yesterday.
 You must act as a Master starting today. Thus, I must accompany you until I determine there is no danger, no matter how minor the business may be.
 Well. Do you have any objections, Shirou?"

I do, but I can't think of any excuses that will convince Saber.

"...Man. All right, let's go, Saber. I'll show you around school."
I slump my shoulders, give up, and call to her.
"Yes, it would be helpful if you did so."
So, the golden-haired foreign girl follows me as if it's natural to do so.


Well.
How will I explain this to Issei...?

"Gah."
...Man.
The student council's door is unlocked, today of all days.

"That is the second 'gah' I have heard. It seems you really want to hide something from me."
...And on top of that, she clearly sees my displeasure.
I don't know if it's her insight as a swordsman, but I don't think I can fool her.

"I just didn't want to cause a big commotion instead of just hiding things. ...Well, I guess it's fate that Issei's here. I'll introduce him to you."
The student council room won't have any other students, and we'll be able to kill time until the archery club ends.

"Issei...? Is he a friend of yours?"
"Yeah. He's this school's, let's seeleader of the self-defense force, and he's a man of steel aiming for a smooth organizational structure."

"A leader of the self-defense force, huh? I might be able to hear some interesting stories from him."
"Maybe. He's a stubborn guy, so he might get along with you."

"Hey, I'm coming in, Issei"
I open the door.
...Then.
There is an unexpected person in the student council room.

I gulp.
The one in the student council room is not Issei, but Kuzuki-Sensei, the teacher in charge of the student council.

"Excuse me. Is Issei here today, Kuzuki-Sensei?"
"No, I have not seen him today. Do you have some business here, Emiya?"
"No, it's more like business with Issei. I wanted to start preparing for the finals."

"I see. Then you should try waiting here. Knowing him, he might decide to escape the boredom at his house and come here."
"Can I stay in the student council room?"
"It should not be a problem. If it were a problem, something would have happened already."

"I will trust you to lock up this place. Put the key on my desk afterwards."
With that, Kuzuki-Sensei leaves the student council room.

...I guess he was being considerate.
According to Issei, Kuzuki-Sensei seems cold, but he actually has a delicate personality.
He must have thought it'd be awkward for me to wait in the student council room with a teacher.

"......Hm?"

Then.
As Kuzuki-Sensei leaves the room, he bumps into Saber, who is waiting behind me.

"...! S-Sensei! She's my acquaintance, and she might come here next year, so she came to look at this school...!"

I quickly make up an excuse.
But this excuse won't be of any use.
Even if she might be a potential student, I cannot bring an outsider into the school.
Fuji-Nee is fine with that, but I don't think the one in charge of the student council will consent to an excuse like that

"...I see. This will be the first new student from a foreign country. It is unexpected, but I should be happy that there is a change."
"Huh?"

...Um.
I guess Kuzuki-Sensei is more understanding than I thought, as he's watching Saber with admiration.

"She should not go unnoticed if she enters this school.
 If you are an acquaintance of hers, you should be considerate. You will be a senior next year. You should take care of the younger students."

"Ohyes. Thank you, Sensei."
"The curfew on weekends is five o'clock. Go home before the gates close."

He leaves for the teacher's office.
Saber watches him go.

"Saber? Is something wrong with Kuzuki-Sensei?"
"...No, nothing in particular. At first, it felt as if he were no ordinary man, but the more I look at him the more ordinary he feels. I can declare that he is not a Master."

"......"
I'm a bit surprised.
It seems Saber is checking if people are Masters or not every time we meet someone.

"That's good. I'd be surprised as well if Kuzuki-Sensei were a magus. But what do you mean, he's not ordinary? Did you feel something special in him?"

"No, there was nothing special about him. But his breathing is too natural and too controlled.
 ...To be honest, I was admiring it. There are no wasted movements in his steps. I do not think I have seen anyone as good as him."

Saber is really praising him.
But if he's that good, isn't he suspicious!?

"Hold on. Are you saying Kuzuki-Sensei is strong in a fight?"
"Huh? That person? Hmm, if it is him...
 I believe he is about as strong as you, physically. In a true battle... I believe he will do as well as any ordinary man."

Saber looks at me with wonder.
But I'm the one wondering.
Kuzuki-Sensei got Saber to admire him, so what does she mean by him being an ordinary person?

"I admired his breathing.
 That person's breathing was ideal for a human. I admired only that one point."

Then.
While we drink the tea we brewed here, Saber explains in a strange way.

"You mean 'breathing' breathing? What's so special about it if it's ideal?"
"It will affect your physical ability as well as your interaction with nature. Western magi do not hold this technique in high regard, but Eastern teachings treat breathing and walking as superior abilities that cannot be taught."

"The ibuki, taking in outside air, is a clear image of connecting the outside world and your inner body. I have heard that to breathe in is to take in God, and to breathe out is to release God.
 This 'right way to breathe' is a secret technique in every school, and one can expect only about one student per generation to be able to acquire it."

"To put it another way, a person who casts spells to cast magic is only a magus.
 But if one's breathing, walking, and their existence itself can perform divine deeds, that person is a pure Magic Circuit that surpasses magi."

"Oh... I think there was something like that in Shintoism.
 Like exterminating evil with mere footsteps or clapping of the hands."

"Yes, one spends all one's life mastering those embodiments.
 But there are rare cases where one is born with this correct way of breathing or walking. These are people who themselves are Magic Circuits."

"As they are abnormal, they will be famed as prodigies and end up being claimed by magi. But there are a few who will grow up without catching anyone's attention.
 These people have within them divine mysteries surpassing magic, without even knowing magic. But"

"But? So Kuzuki-Sensei has a natural-born talent?"
"No. I do not feel such a thing in him.
 ...Um, this is contradictory, but I believe his breathing and walking techniques were acquired through training."

"I cannot believe it myself, but he is not a magus.
 I believe his everyday training is affecting him in the perfect way."

"......???"
What does that mean?
Does it mean Kuzuki-Sensei is living a pure and honest life?

"Saber. Then Kuzuki-Sensei is..."
"It means that he is an ideal teacher. A person like him is not rare.
 It just means that he is admirable for someone like me who cannot breathe perfectly even with training."

Saber sighs with regret.
...That's something more surprising for me, though.
So even Saber, who can do everything, can envy someone, huh?

As it turned out, Issei never showed up.
The school's almost closing, so we lock up the room and go back to the archery range.
...Well, we're at the school already.
I'll go and show Saber around.

"I'm going to go take a walk. I'll come back after I walk around a bit."

"Take a walk? That's fine, but you sure have strange tastes. Kiritsugu-san also had dull hobbies, so you're like him?"
"Myself aside, I don't think taking a walk is a dull hobby.
I don't want to compare the two, but going on a date is like taking a walk as well."

"Hey, dates are different. That's more like a tour to go eat lots of good food."

"I'm saying that aimless behavior is called taking a walk. Well, I'm going.
...Oh yeah, I'm taking the walk inside the school, so I'm not going to buy you any gifts. There aren't any street stalls here."

"Oh yeah. The cafeteria's closed, and the home economics room is closed too.
...I guess it can't be helped. You don't have to bring me back anything, so come back quickly, okay, Emiya-kun?"
At the end, she calls me by my last name like a teacher.
I wave my hand and call out to Saber.

"Tour of the school?"
"Yeah. We're here, so we might as well, right? It should be boring for you as well to just stay in the archery range."

"...You are right. I was not bored, but it is indeed worthwhile to look around the school. I shall check in person to see if your school is safe or not."

Oh, wow.
It was just a suggestion, but it seems Saber likes this idea.
...Well, it seems her expectation differs from mine, but I'll ignore that fact and show her around school.

"This is the back of the building. Here we have the woods behind the archery range. I'm guessing it's about 300 to 600 square meters. It might be as big as the front grounds. It's an example of bold property management that is only allowed because we have a mountain here."
I start out from a nearby place, the woods behind the archery range.

"Oh. 300 to 600? That is far too ambiguous."
"Thanks for your harsh comment. You look disappointed. What's wrong, Saber?"

"It must be your imagination. I was not hoping for anything when you said you would show me around school.
No, I do not mind at all that you brought me here first. I held no hope to begin with, so I cannot lose any hope."

Saber just looks away.
...She looks totally disappointed, but I guess you can take it that she's sulking.

"So what is here, Master? This is a desolate place, but I do not notice anything strange about it."
"Nope. I just told you we have a forest behind our school. Let's go to the next place."

"So, this is the school grounds. Don't go too close since the track team is running there right now. We sometimes play team matches here during PE."

"Team matches...? Such as?"
"Well, our athletics are strong. Baseball's the strongest, so we usually play baseball. We sometimes play dodgeball as well. It's a sport where we separate into two groups and try to beat the other team."

"...Oh. I heard the word team match, and I imagined something where the people follow the vanguard. I guess I was wrong."

"......"
I think whatever Saber imagined is very dangerous.
I don't think I should ask her about it.

"Well, it's a sport to compete for points. The people running right now are competing too. They're using how fast they can run 50 meters as points."
Saber looks around in interest.

"What is it? Are you looking for something?"
"Um, no. ...Um, I saw a sport before, and I was just wondering if such a sporting ground was here or not.
I do not understand other sports, but that sport looked fun to me."

"Oh, a sport you want to try?
 Could it be tennis? We have some courts around back."

"N-No, it is not tennis. Come to think of it, it is not a sport that can fit on this site.
 ...I just felt nostalgic since I was scolded once before for playing a similar sport with a sword."

"A sword...?"
What could that be?
...More than that, I find it funny imagining this serious girl playing with a sword.

"P-Please forget what I said, Master! Well, we are done looking here, so let us go to the next place...!"

Saber pushes me to keep going with the tour.
I show her the hallway.
Then, we get to my classroom on the third floor.

"So this is Master's classroom. I was unsure when I was walking down the hallway, but this is within my tolerance level."
"Tolerance level? You mean if this place is safe or not?"

"Yes. I felt the same magical energy in the hallway as I did at the gate. But I do not feel any magical energy in this classroom. Only Rin's magical energy fills the hallways.
 For now, I do not see any factor that will be a danger to you."

Saber's tension goes away.
I think it's going too far, but Saber's been looking through the school for the sake of my safety.

...To be honest, I'm happy.
It's only been a day since we made a contract, and we don't know anything about each other.
But I understand that Saber is thinking of my safety over everything.
It's bedtime.
The lights finally go out in the noisy tatami-floored room, and silence returns.
They say it gets noisy wherever women gather, and I guess that holds true even for the quiet Saber and Sakura.

"...No, that's wrong. I mostly heard Fuji-Nee's laughter."
But still, it's true that it was loud in that room.
It's not good for my mental health to have girls my age being rowdy in the same house.

"Damn. My sleepiness went away thinking about them."
Things like Saber's troubled face, if Saber and Sakura are getting along, and whether Fuji-Nee is thinking at all or not.

I get a headache the more I think about them. If it's like this, it might've been better to have Saber sleep in the room next to mine.


It's eleven o'clock.
The lights are out and the house is dead silent.
I quietly make my way to the door so I won't wake them up.

I go outside.
The moon is bright, and the wind is cold.
Under the winter sky, the world is silent as if frozen.

It's quiet inside the shed.
This is the place where Lancer cornered me last night.
This is also the place where Saber appeared.
The entrance is open, and it's dark inside, as if to drive away anybody that might enter.

I go inside.
I shut the door to keep the air out and turn on the stove.

"...Shoot at least 200 arrows a day, huh?"
The teaching of archery focuses on accuracy, piercing strength, and endurance.
Accuracy is how well one can hit the target.
Piercing strength is the power to pierce the target.
And endurance is to maintain the accuracy and piercing strength.

...I think there was something in an archery manual...
Something about continuing forever after one masters the true meaning of archery.
...And how one should shoot more than 200 arrows a day...

"...Yeah. I don't know what to do as a Master, so I should at least train my magic."
I sit down and take a deep breath.

"HaaHaa."
...I adjust my breathing and start my usual training.
My mind imagines the same thing.
An image of a sword that pops into my brain.


I ignore it and clear my head even more.
After letting magical energy flow throughout my body, I start the "strengthening" magic like always.
The magic that I succeeded at for the first time in a few years last night.
I have to repeat it before I forget the sensation.

"Trace, on."
I narrow my eyes and breathe out.

That's all for now.
I'll forget about the Holy Grail War, Saber, and Tohsaka once I start this process.
I clear my head from all hesitations.

But during the process...
The thought that Tohsaka might be doing the same training never escapes my head.
"Going back to our conversation, Saber.
 ...Oh, I'll ask formally. Can I call you Saber?"

"Yes. Since I have formed a contract with you as a Servant, I am your sword. I shall follow your orders, defeat your enemies, and protect you."
Saber says so without the slightest hesitation.
There's no room for me to question her about it.

"Become my sword, huh? Is that to win this Holy Grail War?"
"...? Is that not why you have summoned me?"

"No. I only summoned you by chance.
 As you know, I'm only an amateur magus. I'm sorry, but I don't have the knowledge nor the power of a Master.
 But I've decided to fight, so I'll fight. I'm an unskilled Master, but are you okay with that?"

"Of course. You are my Master, Shirou.
 This fact will not change. A Servant does not have the freedom to choose its Master."

...I see.
Then I should try to respond to her to the best of my ability.

"...All right. So you're content that I'm your Master?"

"Yes. But Shirou, I shall not allow defeat for my Master.
 If you have no chance of victory, I shall make one for you. I will use any means possible to have you obtain the Holy Grail.
 We Servants do not serve the Masters without compensation. We serve because we also desire the Holy Grail."

"Huh? Hold on. The Holy Grail, you mean you want it too...!?"

"Of course. After all, the only ones who can touch the Holy Grail in spirit form are we Servants, who are also spirits.
 The Master that wins the Holy Grail War will obtain the Holy Grail through the medium of their Servant. After that, the Servant who served the winning Master will have its wish granted in compensation.
 That is the relationship between Masters and Servants."


...I see.
Now that she says it, it's obvious something like a "heroic spirit" would never obey a mere human being.
Since they have their own objectives, they serve the Master in exchange.

...Then that means Saber has a wish she wants granted.
That is why Saber has no doubts.
But...

"...Hold on, Saber. You said any means possible, right? Does that mean you don't care what measures you take to win the war?
For example"

Doing something like what that priest said.
Involving innocent people and creating a disaster like what happened ten years ago

"Shirou, that is not a possibility.
 I can only do things I allow myself to do. I cannot betray my beliefs. It is against the knight's oath to hurt those who are unarmed."

 "But I must obey if you order so. In that case, you will have to use one of your Command Spells to compensate for treading inside me."
I am overwhelmed by her angered voice.


But still, I'm happy and relieved.
Her lack of doubt gave her the image of a cold fighting machine, but I know now that she is not a cold-blooded killer.

"Yeah, I won't let you do such a thing.
 Like you said, we have to do our best with what we can do. ...I'm really sorry. I insulted you without realizing it."

"Ah... no, I leapt to a hasty conclusion without knowing your intentions. You are not at fault, so please raise your head..."
"Huh? Oh, sorry, I apologized without realizing it."
I raise my head.


I don't know what's so funny, but Saber has a small smile on her face.
"...?"
Well, I'm glad she's smiling, so I won't ask her about it.

"...All right. Then can I ask you something else? A Master is a magus that summons Servants, right?
 That's fine, but I don't quite understand you guys. Like, Saber and Lancer, I know those aren't your real names."

"Yes, those are only the names of the classes given to us. ...All right, I shall describe it briefly since we have the chance."

"We Servants are heroic spirits.
 We have each won fame during our lives or have accomplished some great deed beyond human ability. Whatever the means, we are beings that have reached the rank of gods with our own strength."

That doesn't even need to be said.
Heroic spirits are heroes that had supernatural abilities while they were alive, who are worshipped after their deaths, and are promoted into the ranks of spirits instead of becoming ghosts.

"But that is also to our disadvantage. As we are heroes, our weaknesses have been recorded.
 Revealing our names, revealing our identities, means revealing our weaknesses.
 It will not be a problem if we are fighting a lower spirit, but each of us is a spirit capable of killing the other. If our weaknesses are revealed, the enemy will take advantage of them to defeat us."

"...I see. Heroes usually do have opponents they're weak against. That's why you're hiding your real name and using the name Saber?"

"Yes. However, I am not called Saber only for that reason.
 There are seven Servants called forth by the Holy Grail, and every one of these is selected according to class."

"Class...? You mean like Saber and Archer?"
"Yes. Summoning a true heroic spirit is already almost a miracle. To summon seven is too much even for the Holy Grail.
 As a solution, the Holy Grail prepares seven vessels in advance and only calls forth heroic spirits compatible with these vessels.
 Those are the seven classes.

 Saber.
 Lancer.
 Archer.
 Rider.
 Caster.
 Assassin.
 Berserker.

"The Holy Grail calls forth from all times the heroic spirits, with abilities corresponding to each of these classes.
 And those who receive these classes are called Servants."

"...I see. You were a heroic spirit skilled with swords, so you were summoned as Saber?"
"Yes. There are heroic spirits that have multiple attributes, but I believe I am the best when it comes to swords."

"But that is also the weakness of the Saber class.
 Since I am not a magus, I can only defeat your enemies as your sword."
"So you're not well-suited to trickery. No, I don't think that's a weakness. You're that powerful, so that should be enough, right?"

"Shirou, you cannot win this war just by being strong in battle.
 For instance, if your enemy is stronger than you in combat, what will you do?"

"Huh? Well... if I knew I couldn't beat them in combat, I'd have to do something without fighting"
Having said that much, I understand.
If the enemies are strong, you wouldn't fight a proper battle.
Beating opponents with your sword isn't the only way to fight.
If you can't beat an enemy with your sword, all you have to do is beat them some other way.

"Exactly. If your enemy discovers you are skilled in combat, your enemy will most likely not challenge you in combat. ...And in that sense, Servants that lack ability will use any means possible."

"The Servant Assassin has low attributes, but has a special ability to hide its presence, and the Servant Caster is versed in magic that does not exist in this age.
 You cannot be optimistic because of a mere difference in power. And on top of that, we have our 'Noble Phantasms'. No matter what kind of Servant we are, as heroic spirits, we have our guaranteed fatal attack."

"Noble Phantasm?"
That's not a term I've heard before.
I think I might know what it means from the sound of it, though...

"Noble Phantasms are special weapons carried by Servants.
 Weapons like Lancer's lance, Archer's bow, and my sword are such.
 Heroes are not called heroes by themselves. Heroes have the weapons that symbolize them and make them a hero."

"The hero and his weapon are one. So those who became heroic spirits each wield a powerful weapon.
 That is the 'Noble Phantasm'the trump card for Servants, and the thing we must take the most care of."


...Saber says that Noble Phantasms are weapons that heroes wielded when they were alive.

I recall that blue knight.
The lance that absorbed magical energy from the air and pierced Saber's chest with incredible movements.
That was certainly not something fit for humans.
That lance itself carried a strong curse, but I also felt an overwhelming amount of magical energy in the word Lancer said back then.
Then could it be...?

"Saber. Are Noble Phantasms magic?
 Lancer's lance certainly seemed like a lance with history, but the lance itself wasn't extraordinary.
 But that lance went beyond the realm of weapons with his words. Isn't that some sort of magic?"

"Yes, Noble Phantasms are certainly similar to magic.
 For example, Lancer's lance itself is a Noble Phantasm, but it demonstrates its full potential only when he puts magical energy into it and says its true name."

"A Noble Phantasm could be called a materialized divine mystery.
 As spells are necessary to activate magic, recitation of the true name is necessary to awaken and to activate the Noble Phantasm.
 But there is also a danger in that. By saying the true name of their Noble Phantasm, the identity of the Servant is revealed."

"...Oh yeah. Heroes and their weapons are one. If you know the weapon's name, you naturally know the identity of the owner."
Saber nods silently.

That is why the Noble Phantasm is a trump card.
In exchange for revealing the name, it launches an unavoidable fatal blow.
But when it does not prove fatal... the Servant will expose all its weaknesses.

"Then, Saber. Is your Noble Phantasm that invisible sword?"
"...Yes. But I have not revealed its identity yet. No Servants should know my true name at this point."
Saying that, Saber looks down awkwardly for a second.

"Shirou. I have a request about that matter."
"Huh? What kind of a request?"

"About my real name. Usually, Servants give their true names to their Master only, to determine future plans.
 But you are inexperienced as a magus.
 A superior magus would be able to read your mind, so"

"Oh, so you can't tell me your real name? ...Yeah, you're right. Like hypnotism, suggestion, or... well, I don't think there'd be any, but if any other Master had mystic eyes, I might just start babbling about it.
 All right. Let's do that. I'll rely on you to decide when to use your Noble Phantasm."

"Uhum, can you really decide that so quickly?"
"It wasn't easy. I thought it through.
 I agreed after thinking about it, so don't worry."


...Well.
I get most of this stuff, but I still don't have a grasp of the situation.

This is strange, now that I think about it.
Even though I've decided to fight, the only enemy I know is Tohsaka, and I don't intend to fight her.
Well, I shouldn't be thinking like that because Tohsaka is ready to fight me any day.

"Hey Saber, do Servants and Masters have some sort of a mark? I don't really know what I should be doing."

"No. Unfortunately, there is no clear way to distinguish them.
 But if other Servants are near, Servants are able to sense them. All the more if they are materialized. Servants themselves are powerful magic.
 I am sure you felt Berserker's presence."

"Ughthat is true. But it's bad to be able to tell only when you're attacked. I need to at least know before they approach, so I can take some sort of countermeasure."

"Then, how about searching for the Master's presence? Masters are magi. Since they use magic for a living, they will leak magical energy. If you search for that, you may be able to determine the Masters in this town."
"...Sorry. Unfortunately, I can't do that sort of thing."

After all, I didn't even realize the real identity of Tohsaka, who goes to the same school as I do.
We were in the same building for two years, and on top of that, I've seen her several times.

"Geez. No wonder people call me an amateur. The only evidence I'm even a Master is this Command Spell. It seems there'll be lots of difficulties ahead."
I sigh.
And then.

"Shirou. Could you close your eyes for a moment?"
Saber speaks with a serious face.
"...? Close my eyes? Why?"
"To prove that you are a Master. Just close your eyes and breathe normally."

"......"
...I close my eyes.
I feel something slightly touching my forehead.
Hey, it's prickling. Could this be the end of her sword!?

"Saber? Hold on, are you doing something weird?"
"...Master, please stay silent and concentrate on my fingertip. If you are a magus, you should be able to feel my magical energy."

"Hm."
I see, so it's Saber's finger that's touching me.
I pull myself together and calm down.

Then.
What is this?

"Saber, what was that?"
"It is not something you should be asking me. You and I are connected by our contract, so it is only natural for you to be able to understand my status."

"Understand? You mean, what happened just now?"
"I do not know how you saw it. It is your standard that measures the Servant's ability. Some Masters classify according to color, and some classify according to animals."

"So in other words, you perceive it in a way most comprehensible for you.
 This is a standard concept for a Master, so please check frequently. Like me, once you see someone, you shall understand their details."

...I see.
I was a bit surprised since it was so sudden, but I might be able to act a bit like a Master now.

"Master. I have simplified things, but that is all the explanation I can give you."
"Okay. It was quick, but I get it now. Sorry, Saber."

"...You should not be 'sorry.'
 If you understand the situation, you should be deciding what to do from now on."

She asks me, leaning forward.
...I see.
Saber is the same type as Tohsaka: attack first.

"Well, we won't be doing anything different.
 I don't have the will to go out and beat other Masters like Tohsaka."

"Shirou, that does not make sense. Do you not have the will to obtain the Holy Grail as a Master?"
...Saber narrows her eyes.
They are the calm eyes of a swordsman who allows no disagreement.

I stare back, trying not to lose, and clearly tell her my intentions.

"I do. But that's only because I don't want anyone evil obtaining it. I have no reason to want the Holy Grail for myself."
"!"

"But that doesn't mean I will not fight.
 I'm a magus, even if I'm an amateur. I understand I can't back out of this now. I know I can't survive this without doing anything."

"Then you are saying you are fighting not to obtain the Holy Grail, but rather to prevent the conflict resulting from the Holy Grail?"

"...? ...Yeah, I guess you could put it like that. Yeah, I think that's what I mean. I can't put it into clear words, but such a fight is worth something, right?"

That's right.
I don't feel anything toward the Holy Grail.
But for a reason like that, I think I can fight with all my power and with pride.

"...I do not understand. You say that you are a magus. Then you should desire the almighty Holy Grail. Do magi not master magic because they have a wish they cannot make come true?"

"What are you saying? I have no unfulfillable wishes. I do have lots of things I have to do though."
That's right.
So for now, I should try my hardest not to involve any unnecessary people.

"Then are you saying you do not want the Holy Grail? That you will not fight to obtain it?"
"I didn't say that. Since I'm fighting, I do intend to obtain the Holy Grail."

"That is a contradiction. Why do you desire something that you have no need for, going so far as fighting?"
"...?"
Well, because...
Winning means obtaining the Holy Grail, and most of all...

"You need it, right? So we have to obtain it."


"Yeah, I don't know what kind of people the other Masters are.
 Some of them may be really good people.
 But I've decided to be your ally. So if you say you want the Holy Grail, it's only natural to help you with all my power, right?"


"...Well, it's only an opinion that I received from my father, but he said I should be selfish to become a superhero.
 It's pointless to support everybody, so he told me to only ally with people I like and trust."

"I never thought that way before, but I think that's how I should be now.
 I can't do something like fight for myself.
 But if I can fight for you, then that's good."

And to be honest.
If this girl seriously yearns for it, it's only natural to want to obtain it for her.
...Well, I am a guy, you know.

"Then are you saying you will not fight if I give up the Holy Grail?"
"Hm."
That's a problem.
If Saber says that, all my premises will crumble.

"...No, it would still be the same. I said I'll fight.
 So I won't run. That is for sure, Saber."
I declare while looking at her in the eyes.
Saber does not answer immediately, but looks up at me after letting out a deep breath.

"I understand. If you say so as a Master, I will only obey. My goal is the Holy Grail, and even if your goal is to stop the conflict, our destinations are the same.
 But, Shirou."

Saber stops.
With eyes that seem to be gazing upon something far away, "I cannot clearly put this into words, but you will regret it later on. ...You will surely regret it."
She says those words.
She goes through the darkness.
A desolate night.
She enters the room from the dark hallway.


This is a room in a building somewhere.
There are about fifty workers here.
Most are male, and all of them are scattered about like puppets with their strings cut off.

She grits her teeth.
The darkness is helping her as she cannot see well.
The air in this room is filled with the rotten smell of a plant.
"What is this smell? Can you tell, Archer?"
Opening the door and the windows, she asks someone behind her.
There is no one there.
But there is a presence thicker than air behind her.
"It must be a witch's potion. The one that destroys love."
"...Hemlock? What? The culprit not only took their magical energy, but made the men impotent as well?"
"Then it must be a woman. I don't know what kind of a grudge she has, but it must be a big one to keep taking it out on people even after she became a Servant."
"Stop talking and open the windows. ...They are still breathing. I guess it makes no difference if they are found now or tomorrow.
 Let's get away from here after we're done, Archer."
She opens the windows and treats those who are in especially bad condition. After that, she leaves the room.
"...Damn. I have to get my clothes to the dry cleaner's."
She sniffs her coat.
She didn't touch it in particular, but her coat smells like rusted iron.
The room was sealed.
And the floor of that room was covered in blood that the people threw up.
The presence behind her takes form.
What appears behind herTohsaka Rin, is a knight in red.
It is Archer, who was protecting her in spirit form.

"So? Are they all flowing towards the Ryudou Temple?"
"...Yeah. All the life energy is flowing towards the mountain. The coma incidents in Shinto are all that Master's doing. I don't know what kind of a Master it is, but such a thing is beyond human powers. If there's anyone capable of doing it, it'd be the Servant Caster."
"A witch at the Ryudou Temple, huh? Then I guess we made a mistake last night."

"Mistake...? You're talking about how we got away from Berserker? I think that was the best possible outcome."
"Really? If Caster has such a large network, I am sure she saw our fight last night.
 But we could not defeat Berserker, we let Saber go, and we gave away the scope of our power. What part of this is good for us?"
He speaks sarcastically.
But Rin does not answer him.

It's not a mistake that she made Berserker retreat and helped Saber.
And most of allArcher has not shown the full scope of his power yet.
Last night.
It's true that the "arrow" Archer fired stopped Berserker.
But Rin has yet to figure out its true identitythe identity of that powerful "Noble Phantasm".

"Rin."
...No, she knows the principle behind it.
That was just a bomb.
He just exploded the bomb called the "Noble Phantasm" in front of his enemy.
It does not need to be said how extraordinary that was.
That was a one-time explosion of magical energy, using the strongest phantasm possible.
Broken Phantasm.
That is the name of the Noble Phantasm this knight in red possesses.

"Rin."
...But it is too strange.
A Servant only wields one Noble Phantasm, and it is a part of them that they had for their whole life. What hero can possibly destroy such a thing freely?

"Rin."
It's not easy to fix a destroyed Noble Phantasm.
It's like committing suicide for a Servant to destroy his Noble Phantasm.

"Rin."
In other words, Archer abandoned his strongest weapon when he still had six more enemies he needed to defeat.
No, first of all, he destroyed the proof of his heroism under his own will. It's so crazy that other Servants would faint from shock if they would find out about this

"Rin!"
"Oh, what? Sorry, I wasn't listening."
"...... I asked you what we were going to do now. You must be tired from the previous battle, so we should go back and rest."

Rin clenches her fist at Archer's words.

The previous battle...
Bone Golems that were swarming in the hallway.
She defeated them all by herself.

She did not need Archer's help, nor did she want it.
Most of allshe felt anger towards the enemy who was breaking the magi's rule of not involving innocent people.
That's why she destroyed them.
She mercilessly eliminated every one of them.
...She did not show any sympathy, even if those bones could have been a living person just hours ago.


She did not suffer any wounds from the battle.
Except one.
Since she fought while suppressing her nausea, she cut her lip from biting down on it.

"We're going after Caster. You can still feel her presence, right? We'll finish this off before she can run to the Ryudou Temple."
"What? I'm surprised. I thought it was your principle not to do anything impossible."
"...Yeah. I don't do anything that I see as impossible.
 But this is different, right? I'm sure we'll find some clue if we hurry, and most of all"

"You have to start the fight, huh?
 Man. You're letting the easy enemies run loose while going after the most difficult enemy?"
"...Hey now. We can let Saber be. We can finish them off any time, so we don't have to worry about them.
 We don't have to go out of our way if they're not going to do anything. I'm going to let them go as long as they hide away in their house."

"...Hm. So will it be a different story if that Master is in front of you? For example, if Emiya Shirou shows up in front of you without a care that he's a Master..."
His words are meant to test her.
Looking down at the night town...
"I'll kill him.
 I have no kindness to give to someone who wouldn't understand such a simple fact."
Tohsaka Rin answers as if convincing herself.
It's bedtime.
The lights finally go out in the noisy tatami-floored room, and silence returns.
They say it gets noisy wherever women gather, and I guess that holds true even for the quiet Saber and Sakura.

"...No, that's wrong. I mostly heard Fuji-Nee's laughter."
But still, it's true that it was loud in that room.
It's not good for my mental health to have girls my age being rowdy in the same house.

"Damn. My sleepiness went away thinking about them."
Things like Saber's troubled face, if Saber and Sakura are getting along, and whether Fuji-Nee is thinking at all or not.

I get a headache the more I think about them. If it's like this, it might've been better to have Saber sleep in the room next to mine.


It's eleven o'clock.
The lights are out and the house is dead silent.
I quietly make my way to the door so I won't wake them up.

I go outside.
The moon is bright, and the wind is cold.
Under the winter sky, the world is silent as if frozen.

It's quiet inside the shed.
This is the place where Lancer cornered me last night.
This is also the place where Saber appeared.
The entrance is open, and it's dark inside, as if to drive away anybody that might enter.

I go inside.
I shut the door to keep the air out and turn on the stove.

"...Shoot at least 200 arrows a day, huh?"
The teaching of archery focuses on accuracy, piercing strength, and endurance.
Accuracy is how well one can hit the target.
Piercing strength is the power to pierce the target.
And endurance is to maintain the accuracy and piercing strength.

...I think there was something in an archery manual...
Something about continuing forever after one masters the true meaning of archery.
...And how one should shoot more than 200 arrows a day...

"...Yeah. I don't know what to do as a Master, so I should at least train my magic."
I sit down and take a deep breath.

"HaaHaa."
...I adjust my breathing and start my usual training.
My mind imagines the same thing.
An image of a sword that pops into my brain.


I ignore it and clear my head even more.
After letting magical energy flow throughout my body, I start the "strengthening" magic like always.
The magic that I succeeded at for the first time in a few years last night.
I have to repeat it before I forget the sensation.

"Trace, on."
I narrow my eyes and breathe out.

That's all for now.
I'll forget about the Holy Grail War, Saber, and Tohsaka once I start this process.
I clear my head from all hesitations, and I engross myself in the familiar training.

This is a story from a winter five years ago.

It was a night with a beautiful moon.
I wasn't doing anything, just watching the moon with Kiritsugu.
Even though it was winter, the air wasn't cold.
The corridor was a little chilly, but it was a good night to enjoy the moon.

Back then, Kiritsugu didn't leave the house often.
Not going outside, he would just laze around the house carelessly.
...I regret it even now, thinking back to it.
Why didn't I notice that it was like the actions of an animal that knows its time of death?

"I wanted to be a superhero when I was a child."
Suddenly.
That man, himself a superhero in my child's eyes, said that as if yearning for it.

"What? What do you mean by 'wanted'? Did you give up?"
I became angry and asked him.
Kiritsugu laughed apologetically and looked up at the sky.

"Yes, unfortunately. Being a hero is a time-limited thing, and it becomes hard to call yourself that when you grow up. I wish I'd found that out earlier."
I agreed with that.
I didn't know why, but I thought it couldn't be wrong because Kiritsugu said so.

"I see. Then I guess it couldn't be helped."
"Yeah. It really couldn't be helped."
Kiritsugu answers.
So of course, my response was determined.
"Yeah, it can't be helped, so I'll take your place.
 It's impossible since you're an adult, but it should be all right for me. Let me take on your dream."

"I'll make it come true."

Before I could finish, my father laughed.
He made a face like he didn't even need to hear the rest.
After breathing in, Emiya Kiritsugu said...
"YeahI'm relieved."
He quietly closed his eyes and his life ended.

That is the story from a winter five years ago.
It was a parting that determined the course of Emiya Shirou's life.
It was the night that Emiya Shirou decided to become a superhero.

There's no way I can forget it.
I never said it, but I clearly remember it.
The figure of the man who saved the boy who was left to the fire.

Emiya Kiritsugu held up the dying child and said "thank you".
He said "I'm thankful that I found you."
He made a big smile and thanked someone, as if he was saved by rescuing someone.

...The emotion I felt back then is still engraved in my mind.
Nobody saved me.
I couldn't save anybody.
In it all, I was saved, and a person was there to save me.
That's why I decided to become like him.

Become a superhero, so that I could save people and let no one be killed... just like him.
Even if it may be a child-like fantasy, I yearned to become one.

...And thus.
Kiritsugu, the embodiment of my dream, died peacefully, leaving me his dream of becoming a superhero himself.

It's only natural for a child to succeed his father.
Emiya Shirou must become a superhero and save someone just like the old me.

I swore so as a child.
To fulfill the dream of the man I admired most.

...But to be honest, I'm still wondering...
If my idea is the right one.
Where my idea comes from.
What I can do even despite me being just an amateur.
How to make the dream of making everybody happy, which Kiritsugu always talked about, come true.

......Oh, and...
What I can do now that I'm a Master. There are just so many things that my head's going to explode


I wake up from that familiar dream.
Bright morning sunlight is coming in from the window.
I feel a bit chilly, but I guess it wasn't bad enough for me to catch cold.

"...Geez. I fell asleep here again."
I shake my head and change into my uniform.
It's a bit before six o'clock.
I bet Sakura's already up and preparing breakfast.

I go outside and breathe in the fresh air.
It's a nice morning.
It'd be much more comfortable if there weren't three girls in the house.

"...Oh, let me correct myself. There are only two girls in the house."
I don't want to classify Fuji-Nee as a girl.
Anyway, now
I have to go see how Saber's doing.
It seems Saber is rather sociable, so I think she would've been all right with the other two. But still, I'm worried.

"...I bet Saber's already awake."
Then there's only one place she can be.
Sakura's in the living room, so Saber should be...

Saber is in the dojo as I expected.

"Shirou...? What is it? I believe it is still too early to wake up."
"Huh? No, this is normal for me since I have to prepare breakfast."

"I see. ...I am surprised at how early you wake up."
It must've been really unexpected as she looks surprised.

"...Hmm. I guess I'm an early riser.
 But why were you surprised? Did you think I'm the type that sleeps in?"
"Oh... Excuse me. Taiga is still sleeping, so I jumped to a hasty conclusion that the Emiya family are not early risers."

"Oh, I get it. Fuji-Nee's sleeping ability is unparalleled."
I get it now.
Come to think of it, Saber and Sakura were sleeping in the same room with Fuji-Nee.
I bet it was hard for them to sleep peacefully.

"By the way, good morning, Saber. Were you able to sleep well?"
"Yes. There was no battle yesterday, so I do not have any fatigue."

"That's good. I thought you might not have slept well considering how much Fuji-Nee moves in her sleep.
 ...It also seemed you guys were up late last night. If it gets too loud, I can tell them to give you a separate room."
I propose, thinking that Saber might not like being with Fuji-Nee.

"No, there is no need for such a thing. As long as there are no problems, I would like to go with Taiga's proposal."
"Really? Well, that'll help me out too."
Hmm, is it just me or is there intimacy in Saber's voice?

"Saber. Do you like Fuji-Nee?"
"Yes. Taiga has a good personality. A person with such honesty and open-mindedness is rare. I can understand why you are so honest, having heard that she has raised you."

"...Hmm. I don't know if I should be happy about that or not."
"I am praising her. I have only known her for a short while, but I understand her quite well."

I see.
I agree that Fuji-Nee's easy to understand.
The problem is after that, whether you can understand her logic or not... But that's a whole different story.

"Then you were able to get along with Sakura as well, right? Sakura isn't as bad as Fuji-Nee."
"...That is true, but... I still do not fully understand her. It is not enmity, but I feel that she is still on guard."

"...Hm. So you haven't spoken with Sakura yet?"
"I have made peace with Sakura as well. As you said, she is kind just like Taiga."
"Oh. Then there shouldn't be a problem."
I sigh with relief.

...Um, I don't want to know why she used the phrase "made peace", but it seems she became friends with Fuji-Nee and Sakura.
I'm sure all the problems in this house are solved now.
I'll go help Sakura out.
She's making breakfast for four people. I bet it'll be more time-consuming, and I also want to hear what happened last night.
It seems Saber went with my story, but there's a possibility that they started disliking each other after a night together.

"Good morning, Senpai. I've already starting to prepare breakfast."
"Good morning, Sakura. I'll help with breakfast, so can you give me some space?"
I go into the kitchen after putting my apron on.

"Oh, then please do all the grilling stuff. Um, rice is already cooked, so I'll make the miso soup and the side dish."

Sakura efficiently keeps cooking like always.
She doesn't seem to be worried about yesterday...

"Sakura. Um, about yesterday..."
"Yes? What do you mean by yesterday?"

"Well, it's about yesterday night. You three slept together, right? You seemed worried about having Saber stay here, so I'm wondering how it was."

"I don't understand when you just ask me 'how it was'. I won't answer you unless you ask me clearly."

"Um... I-It'll make me happy if you all got along..."
"Oh. Would it make you happy if I got along with Saber-san?"

"Well, it'd help me out. I decided on Saber's stay without your consent, right? So it's natural for you to be mad and to hate Saber.
 But if you can let it pass and be kind to Saber, um..."
"You'll be happy for me...?"


It's embarrassing to say it, so I just nod.

...She's right.
I'd be happy for Sakura if she would forgive me for letting Saber stay.
Since Sakura's like a family member to me, it'll relieve me if she can forgive my selfish decision.

"I'll answer you in that case.
 We have made peace with Saber-san starting midnight last night.
 I still find her a bit hard to deal with, but I'm sure I can be friends with her. She's hard to understand, but she's cute."

Sakura's smile comes from the bottom of her heart.
That makes me really happy.
It is, but

"Saber's cute...!?"
"Yup. Fujimura-Sensei's calling her Saber-chan, and it seems Saber-san is getting used to it.
 We were in the same room to keep a watch on her, but we'll be sleeping together tonight as well just because we want to."

"......"
That's an unexpected turn of events.
But Saber's cute, huh? She's beautiful, but I don't know about being cute...
I'll go wake Fuji-Nee up.
I know I'm making an absurd choice, but I want to find out what happened last night.
In the worst possible case, Fuji-Nee and Sakura would have made fun of Saber to make her angry, and I'm sure Sakura is mad about Saber staying.

I don't even have to think how troubling it would be to have Saber mad. And Sakura's pretty stubborn too.
So I'm sure it'd be best to ask Fuji-Nee, since she's the one who'll be over it if they did have a fight last night!

I roll up my sleeves and stand in front of the door.
...It seems Sakura and Saber are awake and in the living room and the dojo.

"Here I go. Fuji-Nee, it's morning!"
I slide open the shouji.
And I step into the tiger's den.
And I'm flung outside.

"Shirou? What are you doing there? It's almost time for breakfast, you know?"

She plays innocent as soon as she appears.
I see, I see.
So she doesn't remember grabbing me, rolling three times, and throwing me, huh?

"I'm not lying here because I want to.
 If you have any memory of it, at least help me up."
"Hm? Oh, I think I remember doing a special attack against this super robot that came to invade Earth."

Fuji-Nee opens and closes her hand.
The question marks appearing beside her make me think that she might recall the event, but she probably won't.

"Oh well. Let's hurry and go eat breakfast. I can't have Sakura-chan and Saber-chan waiting."
Dismissing what happened with a mere "oh well" is inexcusable.
I'll get her back for this someday, but there's something I need to ask her first.

"Wait up, tiger. What do you mean by 'Saber-chan'?"
"Hm? Saber-chan is Saber-chan. Sakura-chan, Saber-chan, and I are an alliance of girls that spent the night together!"
"That's a big lie. There are only two girls."

"......!!!???"
H-How was I hit when we were at least ten feet apart...!?

"This is the alliance of girls, over."
"O-Over..."
...I see, she rushed in here in a flash. As expected from a black belt. I keep forgetting, but Fuji-Nee was a well-known swordsman back in her student days.

"...Oh well. But you guys got along well? ...I thought Sakura wouldn't approve of her stay."
"Hm? Oh, I see now. You're pretty kind, Shirou. You were worried that Sakura-chan and Saber-chan wouldn't get along well, right?"

"...Of course I'll worry. I decided on Saber's stay without her consent, so I'm sure she doesn't like it.
 ...I don't like it if she hates me for it, but I can endure it. But I don't like it if Saber and Sakura feel bad."

"It's fine. Sakura-chan and I found out that Saber-chan's a good girl.
 Well, Sakura-chan isn't used to her yet since Saber-chan's kind don't get along with her kind. But they've made peace, so there's nothing for you to worry about."

I don't know what she's so happy about as she makes her way back to the house.
Well, I'm happy too since the problem here is solved now.

"...Fuji-Nee left her student lying on the ground..."
What can I do? I can't stand up after hitting the ground so hard...

Man.
I didn't think that the student council would be closed as well.
There aren't that many people here now, so it'll be difficult to ask around.

"...I'll go home for now. Fuji-Nee should know something about Mitsuzuri."

I get my bag and go out into the hallway.
The sky is tinted red.
The sun is setting and it should get dark in an hour or so.

I get to the stairs.
As I start walking down, I hear a sound above my head.

"?"
I look up.
There
Tohsaka is standing at the top of the stairs.

"Oh, you're here too, Tohsaka?"
"............"
She doesn't answer.
First this morning and then just now... I think her glares are getting worse every time I greet her.

"What? I'm gonna go if you don't have any business with me."
I raise my bag to show her that I'm going home now.

"Sigh."
...?
I don't know why, but Tohsaka sighs.

"I'm stunned. Coming to school without your Servant. Are you sane?"
She murmurs without emotion.

"Of course I'm sane. I can't turn Saber into spirit form, so there's no way I can bring her to school."

"Then skip school. It's like asking for others to kill you if a Master is walking without its Servant.
 ...Do you know how stupid you are, Emiya-kun?"

"WhaI'm not stupid!
 Don't say ridiculous things. Masters don't fight in front of people, right? Then it's out of the question to fight during daytime, and at a school at that."

".........Oh, then let me ask you. Are there people watching us now?"
"Huh?"
What's she talking about? I don't even need to check if there are people around

"Huh?"
Why is this?
Conveniently, there is no one here.
There's no one in the third-floor hallway. I'm sure that's the same for the fourth and the second floor.

The red-tinted building is quiet.
I bet there are only teachers remaining on the first floor

"It seems you finally understand.
 ...Geez, I was more pissed than astonished this morning.
 I told you so many times, but you still came to get killed."
Saying so angrily, Tohsaka rolls up her sleeve.
"?"
A slender, white arm.
On the feminine arm...
Something like a glowing tattoo appears.

"What?"
It's not a Command Spell.
Could that be? Even though I don't have one, it must be the proof of a magus, a Magic Crest.

"I don't even need to explain to you, right?
 This is a crystallization of the magic passed down my family. I can cast any magic carved on here just by filling it with magical energy."
...Yes.
A Magic Crest is like an attached engine, separate from the Magic Circuit in a magus.
There's no difficult incantation or procedure to follow.
It is an ultimate hastening mechanism that runs the car called magic just by turning it on.
But the Magic Crest will not show up unless it is in use.
The Magic Crest is like a separate Magic Circuit that is formed using the magical energy of the magus.
"I told Archer to go home. The 'Gandr Shot' in the Magic Crest should be enough for you."
There's no emotion in her voice.

That makes me realize that she's serious.

"You can run away, but that's just making it hard on yourself. I'm going to win in the end no matter what you do."
She coldly says so.
But my head's spinning.

Fight here...?
Why does it have to be here?
Why does it have to be now?
And why do I have to fight against Tohsaka?

"H-Hold on, Tohsaka! Are you insane? This is the school! Who knows who'll come up if we make a commotion"

"I'll think about it when that happens. I don't let chances in front of me slip by. I'm sorry, but I'm taking care of you right here and now.
 ...And besides, I don't think I can stand having you walk about carelessly."

"I-I said hold on...! I don't have any intention of fighting you"
"I do even if you don't! Just prepare yourself, Shirou!"

She moves her arm and starts the fight.

"!"
What sort of magic is it?
The instant she points her left hand at me, my vision is filled with light.

"......!"
It's about four steps forward to the stairs leading to the second floor.
If I'm to retreat back to the hallway, it'll also take me about four steps to get to cover.
This is no time to think. I
Tohsaka's serious.
There's no place to run, even if I retreat back to the hallway. I'll jump down the stairs in front of me...!

"Hah!"
I kick the floor with full force.
It's about a meter and a half down. I can easily take this kind of height...!

A running long jump of a meter and a half high, a meter wide.
I land without hurting myself.

"Fu"
I have an advantage of one floor between us.
So now, I only have to run down to the first floor and get out of the building

"?"
What... happened?
It came from above...
It feels like a giant blob of jelly fell on top of me...
I can't move my legs.
The weight of the jelly is stopping my feet.
I try to shake off the pressure on my back.

I feel like throwing up when I move.
...It's cold.
I have goosebumps all over me, my joints are hurting, my muscles are heavy, and my organs are half shut down.

"Crapt-this is..."
It's not because of the jelly that I can't move.
This is a bad case of the cold.

Tohsaka's magic.
The Gandr Shot, a magic that'll infect the target with a cold, has hit me.
As a resultmy body is so sick that it can't move on its own

"Just as I expected. I knew you'd go there if I prepared an easy escape route."

I hear Tohsaka's voice from afar, as if she's contacting me from the moon.

"Let me apologize first. What I'm going to do now is as bad as taking away your life."

Her cold finger digs into my neck.
When I realize it's Tohsaka's finger and try to fling it away...

"Goodbye.
 I don't think you knew, but I've known you for a long time."

My consciousness shuts down as if it's shorted out.

"...Huh...? It's morning already?"
I rouse my sleepy mind and pull myself up.
It's past six o'clock. I should be preparing breakfast now.

"Good morning, Senpai. Breakfast is already prepared."
"Oh. ...I'm sorry, I made you do it by yourself again. I'll make dinner, so please forgive me."

"No, you can't do that. It's my turn to cook tonight, so please let me."
"Ugh. But I'd be relying on you too much if I made you cook breakfast and dinner. Let me cook tonight. I want to make it up to you for sleeping in."

"Hmm. Then let's cook together.
 I'll help you, so please come home early."
"All right. I'll cut work short today."

I head to the table while apologizing to Sakura.
Breakfast's already on the table, and Fuji-Nee runs in at the last second like always.

"Good morning! Everyone sure is doing well this morningwait, huh...? What is this, Shirou!?"
"Huh? What do you mean? Did you forget something at your house?"

"Huh? Huh? Huh? That's weird. I thought something's strange, but nothing's strange at all.
 ...But it's still bothering me. Shirou, aren't you forgetting something?"
"Forgetting something? Like what?"

"D-Don't ask me. I'm asking you since I can't figure it out.
 Sakura-chan, don't you think something's strange? It feels like we're forgetting something or missing something."

"No. I think it's just your imagination, Fujimura-Sensei.
 We're not forgetting anything nor are we forgetting anyone."

"Hmm. Oh well. If I can't remember it, it must mean it's not important."
Fuji-Nee seems satisfied as she sits down and starts eating.
This is a normal morning in this household.

Thirty minutes after Fuji-Nee and Sakura leave...
I leave the house as well.

I walk up the hill.
It's past seven-thirty. The road is filled with students like me.
A familiar scene.
I breathe in the perfect morning air.

...Then.
I notice that a female student is looking at me.
She must have found it awkward that our eyes met, as she starts walking on quickly.

"Oh, Emiya? Were you glaring at Tohsaka?"
"Huh...? Oh, morning, Issei.
 I wasn't glaring at her. It's just that our eyes met."

"Really? That's fine, but make sure not to pick a fight with Tohsaka, okay? It's her principle to counter twice as hard. You'll be throwing away your last year in school if you do so."

I don't know how serious he is, as Issei murmurs Buddhist scriptures.
But that's needless worry.

"Are you stupid? First of all, I don't even know her.
 ...Well, she did look beautiful, but I didn't know such a person went to our school."
"Yes, that is the correct response. That thing is too much for us humans. It is our way not to get involved with her.
 Huh, I was worried for a second, but everything is settled now!"

Issei goes up the hill.
"......"
I watch him go as I stand there.

A morning scene with nothing missing.
My left hand hurts a bit.

"Everything's settled? What happened and what ended?"
I hear the first bell from the top of the hill.

...It's eight o'clock already.
As the school gate closes, I feel like I'm locked out from something.
"I"
...Nothing comes to mind.
I feel uneasy for some reason, and I can't think of where to go or where to return to
I still have the weapon in my hand!

I swing my arm while still suspended.
She must have seen it coming.
The Servant in black avoids it midair.
The Death in front of me smiles.

"!"
I swing my body desperately to avoid it, but it's useless.
The Servant mercilessly thrusts her "nail" at my eye
And she is shot from the side by numerous bright bullets.

"Ouch...!"
I fall to the ground.
The bullets cut the chain and I hit my butt on the ground.


The Servant in black turns her back.
She jumps onto a branch and retreats like a beast.
I can pull out the nail in my right arm!

I throw away my weapon and reach for my right arm with my free left hand.
"You are brave. You are always selecting the choice that brings you pain."
But my movements have to be like slow-motion to her.
The Servant in black thrusts out her nail to pierce my left hand as well!

"!"
I swing my body desperately to avoid it, but it's useless.
The Servant mercilessly thrusts her "nail"
And she is shot from the side by numerous bright bullets.

"Ouch...!"
I fall to the ground.
The bullets cut the chain and I hit my butt on the ground.


The Servant in black turns her back.
She jumps onto a branch and retreats like a beast.
"Are you all right, Emiya-kun...!?"
As soon as she runs up to me, she takes my hand.

"I-I have to stop the bleeding...! Do you have anything to wrap around it...!?"
"Um... Oh, I have a handkerchief. It's probably clean since Sakura prepared it for me."

"Ugh, it's not much better than mine. But it's better than nothing. We can make do with my towel and that."

Tohsaka takes my pulse and murmurs something like a spell.
...It must be styptic and painkiller, as my right hand feels a bit better.
Tohsaka carefully puts the handkerchief on my wound and wraps the towel around it.

"......"
Seeing her like that reminds me.
Tohsaka is beautiful and a nice person.
I was watching her from a distance, admiring her for being an honor student, until three days ago.
As it turns out, her true personality was far away from my imagination, but it's not like she was any different inside.

My heart's pounding.
Tohsaka's a nice person, she's so close to me, and she's so beautiful that I can forgive her for everything that happened until now... I can't think straight

"All right, I guess this is good for now.
 ...So, what was that? I tried to back you up since you were in a terrible situation when I caught up with you."
"I don't know. I followed that person here, and I was attacked."

I concisely tell her what happened.
...I decide not to say anything about seeing Shinji.
It might have been my imagination, and even if it was him, I don't have any proof that he's connected with that Servant.


"Don't make a face like that. I couldn't tell who she was, but she's a Servant. So that means there's another Master here."

"...Yeah. I knew there was another Master at this school, so this means that Master finally made a move."
Tohsaka slumps her shoulders.
...Hm.
It seems Tohsaka already knew about this third Master.

"Hm?"
Then that Master is the one who attacked the female student...?
"Hold on, Tohsaka. How's that girl...!?"

"She's doing better. She's sleeping in the nurse's office now, so her life's not in danger."
"I see. That's good."
I sigh with relief.
...That means all problems have been resolved.
Then what's left is

"Huh? W-Why are you staring at me? H-Hey, I won't do something like that!"
I don't know how she misunderstood.
Tohsaka, um, sometimes makes the stupidest misunderstandings.

"Hey, I know that. You won't do such a thing. What I want to ask is if you want to continue. Do you want to keep fighting or not?"

Hearing this, Tohsaka freezes.

...How long did it last?
Tohsaka glares at me once, then hangs her head as if giving up.

"......"
That's fine.
But it troubles me if she makes such a face near me.

"Tohsaka? What do you want to do?"
"I won't do it. This is it for today. I'm not in the mood anymore, and I owe you for another thing."
She gets up and brushes dirt off her knees.

"Let's go. I know it hurts, but bear it until we get to my place."
Tohsaka offers me her hand.
"......?"
I tilt my head in wonder and look at Tohsaka's eyes.

"I'm saying we're going to my house. You can't heal that wound yourself, right?"
"Ohwell, that's true. But why?"

"Hey now.
 You'll die of necrosis if we leave that wound be. It'll be my fault if you lose your arm."
Tohsaka pulls at me as if telling me not to talk back.
"HuhHuh?"
Wait.
I don't get it at all.

Tohsaka's house is in the residential district on the other side of the town.
I guess there are Western-style houses at the very top, but I've never actually been up there.
This is as far as I've been, and I don't know anything about what lies ahead.

So.
This is the famous Western-style mansion at the top of the hillthe main base of Tohsaka, a magus with a prestigious lineage.


I look up at the extravagant mansion, dumbfounded.
...Well, I thought I was used to things like this because of Shinji's house, but this has its own taste.

"Emiya-kun? The entrance is over this way."
"Ohyeah. I know, I know."
I clear my throat and follow after Tohsaka.
...Man.
I can understand if I'm on guard being invited to another Master's base, but I'm getting nervous just thinking that I'm going into Tohsaka's house.
So.
This is the living room in Tohsaka's house, the place Tohsaka Rin lives every day.

"Let me see your arm."
She gets straight to the point.
"......Please."
I sit on a chair and show her my right arm.

She takes off the towel that's wrapped around it.
I think she's closer to me now.
I didn't notice before, but her black hair looks really pretty and causes my heart to beat faster.

"...Huh? That's weird. The wound's smaller than before. Do you have a healing charm on you?"
"Huhno, t-that's not true!"
"Really? But your wound's almost healed."
"I didn't say anything about it being prettyhuh? What did you say, Tohsaka?"

"I said your wound's almost healed up. I only stopped your bleeding, so it shouldn't be healed."

"Hm... But I don't know anything about it."
"...Really? Well, you are an amateur, so there's no way you can heal yourself. ...Then it might have to do with Saber's ability..."

"What does Saber's ability have to do with my wound healing?"

"...Well, this is just a guess. You might have made a mistake when you made a contract with Saber, so the flow of power might be reversed.
 I don't know how you formed your contract, but I hear that there are Servants that make their contractor immortal.
 Saber's self healing powers might be flowing into you."

"...Hmm. Does that mean my wounds will heal as long as our contract exists?"

"...Well, I guess so. But I wouldn't rely on it. Saber's healing your wounds, so it means you'll be using up Saber's magical energy.
 And more importantly, that's a power to heal your wounds, but not to bring you back to life. It'll be all over if you die, so don't do such a reckless thing again."

...Oh.
I don't know when she did it, but the bandage is wrapped already and the treatment is done.
She pats my arm and stands up.
So.
This is the living room in Tohsaka's house, the place Tohsaka Rin lives every day.

"Let me see your arm."
She gets straight to the point.
"......Please."
I sit on a chair and show her my right arm.

She takes off the towel that's wrapped around it.
I think she's closer to me now.
I didn't notice before, but her black hair looks really pretty and causes my heart to beat faster.

"...Huh? That's weird. The wound's smaller than before. Do you have a healing charm on you?"
"Huhno, t-that's not true!"
"Really? But your wound's almost healed."
"I didn't say anything about it being prettyhuh? What did you say, Tohsaka?"

"I said your wound's almost healed up. I only stopped your bleeding, so it shouldn't be healed."

"Hm... But I don't know anything about it."
"Really? You don't have a clue even though something like this happened before as well?

"Hold on, you're confusing me more now. Something like this happened before? When?"

"It was recently.
 You were wounded when Berserker attacked, right?
 That wound healed up by itself.
 ...I thought it was your magic at the time, but now that I think about it, you're not that skillful."

"Heh, sorry I'm not skillful. ...But what does it mean? I've never had such a thing happen to me before."

"...Hmm. The only reason I can think of is the contract you made with Saber. I don't know how you formed your contract, but I hear that there are Servants that make their contractor immortal.
 Saber's self-healing powers might be flowing into you."

"...Hmm. Does that mean my wounds will heal as long as our contract exists?"

"...Well, I guess so. But I wouldn't rely on it. Saber's healing your wounds, so it means you'll be using up Saber's magical energy.
 And more importantly, that's a power to heal your wounds, but not to bring you back to life. It'll be all over if you die, so don't do such a reckless thing again."

...Oh.
I don't know when she did it, but the bandage is wrapped already and the treatment is done.
She pats my arm and stands up.
It's getting late.
I went to the dojo with Saber after dinner to receive my punishmentSaber called it training, but I swear she was just beating me upand when we finished, it was past ten o'clock.
It seems they're sleeping together again today, as Fuji-Nee and Sakura go to the Japanese-style room.

"Shirou...? What is wrong? Are you not going back to your room?"
"Hm...? Yeah, I'm going. But there's one thing I wanted to ask you before that."

"Please go ahead. I will answer anything I can."


I guess I'll get right to the point.
What Archer said...
Servants, who have no freedom, seek the Holy Grail to obtain freedom...
It has to be the case for Saber, but he said Saber would not wish for freedom.

"...Saber. You need the Holy Grail, right?"
"Yes. My objective is to obtain the Holy Grail. I became a heroic spirit for that reason. I believe I told you this before."

"I know. But why?
 A Servant can stay in this world without a Master if it obtains the Holy Grail, right?
 Thenyou're going to obtain the Holy Grail and do what you wish here, right?"

"No. I will leave this world once I obtain the Holy Grail. It is not allowed for me, someone from a different time, to stay in this time. And most of all, I do not have anything I would want to do."

Her eyes show her determination.
It shows no hesitation nor lies. In that case, there's nothing I can say to her.

"I see. I can't tell you strongly since I don't know what your wish is, but..."

...I think it's unlike Saber to ask for a wish from the Holy Grail.
I don't know what the Holy Grail is.
But I vaguely think that it's not appropriate for this golden-haired girl.

"I promised you that we'll obtain the Holy Grail. ...So I'll believe your words for now."
"...? Is something wrong? You have not seemed well since you came home."

"That's not trueoh yeah. Saber, about our course of action."
Saber looks serious now.
As expected of her. Saber is Saber no matter how well she gets along with Fuji-Nee.
It's annoying, but her true nature is revealed in her fighting, like Archer said.

"I went to school today and found out there's a third Master there. ...Um, I had a quarrel with Tohsaka. A lot happened, and we ended up promising a truce until we find the Master hiding at our school..."

I report what happened today in a hurry.
Saber is listening seriously at first, but as the story goes on...
She starts to look at me unhappily.

"...Hm. Are you against cooperating with Tohsaka?"
"No. I agree that you should learn from Rin, as you have no knowledge.
 But I would have liked you to tell me earlier. And if you could have, consulted me beforehand as well."
Saber glares at me.
...I'm ashamed of myself since she's absolutely right.

"Then you will cooperate with Rin tomorrow to search the school?"
"Yup. I'll call for you if we find something strange, so stand by here until then."

"...Phew. It is too lenient a plan, but it will be perfect until you get used to battles.
 So we will be going after the Master that set up the boundary field at school?"
I nod.
After thinking for a while...

"Let me confirm.
 After we defeat the Master at your school, your cooperation with Rin will end, and she will be your enemy again.
 Is that correct?"
Saber asks to make sure.
Well
I can't say for sure.
I owe Tohsaka, and most of allI personally don't want to fight against Tohsaka.

"...No. I can't say for sure yet.
 There might be more to do even after we defeat the Master at my school. ...There's that monster called Berserker as well. If we can cooperate, we should cooperate for as long as we can."

"I see. I will obey if Master says so. ...But that will only make it harder for you. Please do not regret your choice when the time comes."
Saber bows and leaves.


...I know.
The more we cooperate, the greater the likelihood that we'll fight in the end.

...I should try to be Tohsaka's enemy for as long as I can if I don't want to be mentally hurt.
Or else, what's going to remain is a big scar.
Because no matter which one of us wins, the survivor has to finish off the loser
...I guess that's true no matter how much I smooth this over.
Tohsaka will challenge me even if I refuse to fight.
If that happensit'll just be more painful for Tohsaka if I get killed by her without putting up a fight

"...Yeah. She'll be my enemy again after we defeat the Master at my school. That's what you want, right, Saber?"
"Yes. I do not have anything to say if you understand. We shall cooperate with Rin and have you experience more battles."
Saber bows and leaves.


Battles are unavoidable as long as I'm a Master.
...We will eventually fight as long as we're alive.
When that time comeswill I be able to fight Tohsaka like Saber said?
...I walk through the night town.
It's still seven o'clock, so I still see people around.
I don't think any guard is necessary, but I can't turn down her goodwill.


But maybe I should've refused.
...My nerves are getting strained.
There are goosebumps on my skin, and I might throw up if I let my guard down.


I feel hostility from behind me.
The invisible guard is watching out for the one he has to protect.
...Man, how is he a guard?
The hostility I feel is definitely coming from the man behind me.

"This is fine. It might end up like that night if you go any closer to my house."
I tell the presence behind me.
Archer doesn't answer.
He just accepts my words and tries to leave.

"Wait. Don't you have something you want to say?"
I glare at the invisible guy.
The leaving presence stops.
He appears, with hostility still present.

"I have a better opinion of you. It seems you can at least feel hostility. Wow, I thought you were a pacifist who wouldn't even kill an insect."

"Don't mock me. I'm a magus. If my enemy wants to fight, I'll fight back."
I confront the knight in red.
He smiles as if to make fun of me and shrugs his shoulders.

"Don't be ridiculous. A magus that does not smell like blood is only a half-ass.
 Didn't you learn so from your teacher, Emiya Shirou?"
"Wha"
My spirits weaken.
...Kiritsugu certainly said so.

Magi are tinged with blood.
It doesn't matter if you hurt or don't hurt anyone. This path is a path wet with blood.
Isn't that why Kiritsugu told me not to be a magus?

"...Are you saying you don't smell blood on me?"
"Of course not. You're not fit to be a Master in that regard either. You are different from Rin."
"What is that? Are you saying you can smell blood on Tohsaka?"

"Yes. She is rather kind-hearted, but she's merciless when she has to be. She wouldn't go around looking for other Masters every day if that wasn't the case."


She's looking for other Masters every day...?
That means she's fighting other Masters.
It's not like it's over once she finds a Master.
Then

"...Then she's doing something like what happened at school every day?"
The event at school.
The same thing that happened in the woods today...

"Of course not. I wish today would be the only case. It seems my Master of great skill and mind turns immature only when she's facing you."

"First of all, she doesn't need to cooperate with you with the skills she has.
 But she's still doing meaningless things. I am against this cooperationbut well, it cannot be helped. Servants obey their Master."

"Isn't that right, Emiya Shirou? It means that a Servant has to obey its Master, even if he turns out to be a useless amateur."
...Is he...
Talking about me and Saber?

"I see. I feel bad for Tohsaka, partnering with such a cynical guy."

"...Man, I'm stunned. Are you still saying such things?
 I will warn you. Do not worry about your Servant's personality. We are summoned only to fight. We are only a tool bound by the Command Spell. You guys have total control over us, so ignore what your tool has to say."


I can't tell him that's not the case.
What Archer, the one bound by the Command Spell, said is definitely true.
...I can't think of Saber as a tool, but it's true that Saber is bound by the Command Spell.

"So, why did you stop me? Do not tell me it's something as ridiculous as wanting to make friends with me."
"!"
...Ugh.
I don't have a reason.
I just didn't like him, so I wanted to complain to him.

"Umoh yeah. You want the Holy Grail as well, right, Archer?"
I ask an obvious question in desperation.
Then.

"Holy Grail? Oh, the evil treasure chest that is said to grant wishes, huh? I don't want such a thing. My wish cannot be granted by a thing like that."
The knight in red declares contemptuously.

"What...?"
That's contradictory.
Servants desire the Holy Grail.
Isn't that why they answer the call of the magus and become Servants...?

"Wait, what's with that? Then why are you a Servant?"
"It could not be helped over the course of the event.
 I do not have free will. You must think we are answering the call by choice."

"What?"
'Don't have free will'...?
Does that mean he was called against his will even though he doesn't want the Holy Grail...?

"How stupid of you. Did you really not think about it?
 Look, a Servant is one that is summoned.
 No, heroic spirits are summoned not out of their own will, but by the wills of others.
 We become heroic spirits because of our achievements, and we become support for people in the future."

"But. Do you think that heroic spirits would really wish to be an aide to humans?"
"Well..."
...I don't know.
If they are called heroic spirits, they should be pure.
That's why I imagined them protecting people, but that's not the case for a lot of the Servants I've encountered.

"That's right. 'Heroic spirits' do not have a will.
 Heroic spirits are there just to protect the people."

"We are only summoned when there are inconveniences, and we disappear after we finish our remedial measures.
 We are beings that should not exist. We are not recognized even if we save the world.
 These are the heroic spiritsthe ones of convenience that are called the guardian.
 It is all over once we become one. Our wills are taken away."

"Wha"
One that is summoned only to disappear.
Heroic spirits are tools without a will?

"That can't be true. You and Saber have a will. ...You might have been summoned against your will, but don't you have a choice after you're summoned?
 Saber's saying she won't do things that go against her will."

"Of course. We are Servants. I don't know who made this system, but this war is well-structured.
 It gives form to what should only be a part of the main body, and we are summoned as the real heroic spirits.
 As heroic spirits are given bodies, we can regain our humanity with them. Along with our former desires and grudges."

"That is why Servants seek the Holy Grail.
 The Holy Grail should be able to fulfill our desires, and it will allow us to stay in this world as humans, even if it may be for a short while."

"Stay here as a human"
That must mean they can be set free as an individual and not a Servant.

...And to add, the Holy Grail has powers to grant wishes.
If it allows them to grant the wishes they had before they died, it's natural for Servants to cooperate with their Masters.
So the Holy Grail must be a miracle for the Servants as well.

"...How can you say you don't need such a thing? You can fulfill a wish you couldn't make come true, and you can even quit being a Servant."

"It is a simple story.
 I did not have a wish I could not make come true."

"Huh?"
"I am different from others. I made my wish come true, died, and became a heroic spirit.
 That is why I don't have any wishes, nor do I wish to stay here as a human. That must be the same for your Servant."

"D-Don't be stupid. Saber said she needed the Holy Grail. She's not like you, who's being a Servant without an objective."

"My objective?"
Archer murmurs.
"!"
Why is it?
It's just a normal murmur, but a chill runs through me.

"...Heh. It's the same even if you have or don't have an objective.
 Ask your Servant if you're curious. Saber's objective is to obtain the Holy Grail, but she will not use it for herself. In that regard, she is an ideal guardian. She is literally a 'slave'.
 Remember this.
 If you are to be her Master, do not forget this."

His presence disappears.
The knight in red talks cynically until the very end and leaves.
"I'm home."
Even though I don't feel like it, I follow my habit as I go into my house.

I feel liveliness from the living room.
I bet Fuji-Nee's watching TV and Sakura's preparing dinner.
Saberis she in the living room?


I recall Archer's words and shake my head.

I don't know what he wanted to say, nor do I want to know.
But it's stuck in my head and it won't go away.
A familiar called a Servant.
His honest opinion, scorning heroic spirits as mere cleaners.

"Oh. Welcome home, Senpai."
Even though she's in the middle of cooking, she comes out to greet me.
"I'm home. I'm sorry I'm late. How much of dinner's done?"

"I just started preparing. But I don't think I need your help. We're having stew tonight at Fujimura-Sensei's request."

"I see. There's certainly nothing I can help with."
Looking, I see that everything's been cut up already.
Knowing how good Sakura is, I bet all she has left to do is to cook it.

"Where's Saber? I don't see her in the living room."
"Saber-san is sleeping. She said she wanted to be woken up when you come home..."
"...Hm. Was Saber mad?"

"Um...... I don't think so. Saber-san always has sharp eyes."

...If Sakura's hesitating to say it, it must mean Saber's really mad.
It's only natural though, since I broke our promise of me coming home before dark.

"Oh, welcome home, Shirou. Saber-chan was really mad. She said she wanted to talk to you in the dojo after you got home."
Fuji-Nee says something really scary while she munches on a mandarin.

"Fuji-Nee. You didn't happen to tell Saber weird things, right? ...Um, like a person who breaks a promise should be punished by getting a beating with a shinai..."

"I did tell her. I told her she doesn't need to hold back."

I see.
So my enemies aren't just other Masters. There is another one hiding here as well.

"Can I ask you something? Did you take Saber to the dojo? Did you tell her to use a shinai if she wanted to train?"

"Yeah. We fought a bit, but she's amazing. She doesn't know kendo, but she seems more like a swordsman than I do. Does she do fencing or something?"

"No, I don't think she does. I think she's more like you."
...Like how she swings around a big sword unmatched to her size, and how she attacks enemies like a wild animal.

"Well, I'll accept the punishment since it's my fault.
 By the way, about Mitsuzuri. Do you know if she's home or not?"

"Huh? How do you know about that? I didn't think the news got out."
"I heard about her in the student council room. So, how is it? Did anyone find Mitsuzuri?"

I stare at Fuji-Nee.
Fuji-Nee's a teacher, even if she may not seem like one.
She keeps quiet about things she shouldn't talk about, and I'm sure she'd tell a lie to comfort a student.
So I have to stare at her to notice any changes while I ask about Mitsuzuri.

"So, Fuji-Nee. Has nothing changed?"
"...I guess it can't be helped. You look like you'll run out if I keep quiet, and it's not like this is a secret.
 But this is a special case, you know? I'm only telling you since you're her friend."

"I know. I appreciate it, so tell me quickly."
"I'll tell you the results. Mitsuzuri-san was found earlier today. I'm sure the examination's over and she's home by now.
 She's kind of confused, but she doesn't have any wounds and there's no danger to her life. I can't tell you anything else. If you're her friend, ask her about it."

"I see.
 So it wasn't serious, huh?"

...Thank God.
I don't know what Mitsuzuri got into, but I know it has something to do with the strange incidents happening in town.
It's likely that the source of it is this Master at my school.
I don't know what I would've done if something happened to Mitsuzuri.

"...Oh yeah. Sakura, can I talk to you for a bit?"
"Yes? What is it, Senpai?"
"It's nothing much. I'm just wondering if you know anything about Shinji."

"Um... I'm sorry, Senpai. I spent the night here last night, so I didn't go home. I heard that he skipped school today, but..."

"So you don't know what he's up to, huh? ...Yeah, it's no surprise you don't know. Sorry. I asked you something stupid."

"No, that's not true...! I know about Nii-san more than anybody else, so I should know why he skipped school, right?"
"I don't think so. And it really helps when you're here."

...The event in the woods.
If the person there was really Shinji, he has to have some kind of connection with the Servant in black.
Thenthere's the worst case possibility that he is a Master.
If that's the case, wouldn't it be dangerous to let Sakura go back to her house?

"Senpai, what does that mean?"
"Sakura. Spend the night here tonight. You can use Fuji-Nee's clothes if you don't have a change."
"EhS-Senpai, that's"

"It'd help me out if you can stay here for a while.
 Well, you can go home if it's inconvenient for you."
...Oh.
But it's absurd. It's troubling to be asked so suddenly to stay over.

"I'm sorry for saying things to trouble you."
I bow my head and apologize.
Then.
"...Okay. I'll do as you want."
Sakura agrees so quietly that it's almost lost in the sound of the cooking stew.
Congratulations, everyone!
This is the true ending of Tohsaka-san's route!
Life is back to normal for Shirou. This is indeed a grand finale!
Well, everyone, let's meet next time in Fujimura-Sensei's route, "We don't need tiger"-
No way, you idiot!
Lies that sound like they're true are not allowed! We can't have anyone tricked into confusion in the Q&A corner!
You have grown strong, buruma.
Oh, Senpai! Hi, you look beautiful as always!
Just go on and explain the situation, buruma.
Osu! There are two ways to get to this bad end!
One is a simple mistake in your choice. Getting shot at after stupidly escaping forward.
And the other is a bit troubling, and that is the case where you come here from Saber's route.
To put it simply, you need to restart from the morning of the 4th day if the 5th day's title was "Unlimited Blade Works" even though the title on the 4th day was "Fate".
To put it more simply
Death to betrayers.
T-That's wrong, Senpai. We came to this bad end because the alliance was not formed. It's not that Shirou betrayed you.
......
Oh, she's gone...
Anyway, there are two ways to avoid this bad end!
Escape back when you're attacked by Rin! Or if the choice didn't even appear, you have to restart from the morning of the 4th day!
And a special tip for those that came here without seeing any ending!
Um, you can't clear Rin no matter what you do during your first play.
It'll be smart to fight along with Saber as her Master at least once.
Hi, this is everyone's support, the Tiger Dojo...
I don't feel like doing this... Snakes and spiders sure are scary.
I don't get it. What's wrong with you today, Taiga?
Well, I hate snakes. I hate spiders as well. I hate things that crawl in general.
Wow. But snakes are in sake. You like sake, right?
...Where did you get that wrong information...?
Anyway, snakes are bad. And she's a real witch to hang Shirou with a chain. I can see her Master's character from how she's acting.
Fu.
...Hey. Why are you two laughing?
Noooothing. I'm just thinking about how brave you are.
 Only seven more times until you're dead.
Gaah!
You two sure are close! And what do you mean by seven more times until I'm dead!?
Who knows. I guess we can look forward to the 25th Tiger Dojo.
So. What shall we do about the usual training, dying master?
Hmm... I don't want to do it, but I will.
Well, Shirou should do his best without using the Command Spell. That is all.
What is that, dying master? That's not what you said before. You told us to go on and use the Command Spell.
It can't be helped since there are only two left. And it looks like this snake woman is testing Shirou, so it's dangerous to take the easy way out.
And don't call me dying master.
...Master. I'm beginning not to be able to tolerate this anymore.
I don't think it's forgivable to hit a lady's head.
No can do!
I have kept it a secret until now, but there's a petition that was sent to me.
"Please reeducate the selfish loli child with your powers, Sensei."
I have read this and decided to act like a devil to train you.
What is that? Who is this petition from?
That's a secret. Shirou has told me "please keep it a secret since she'll do terrible things to me if she finds out"!
Ohh. So the petition is from Shirou, huh?
Crap! No, it's not! I'm not a secret agent!
At the very least, please go easy on him!
Of course. Geez, what should I do to Onii-chan the next time I see him?
......
Well, everything is settled now! Please fight through the main story without seeing this devil child!

There are only two sets of shoes at the entrance.
Fuji-Nee's and Saber's.


I'm worried, so I go to the living room without saying "I'm home".
I go through the hallway with quick steps.
As I expected, Sakura isn't in the living room.
Moreover, there's a person that looks like Fuji-Nee doing something like cooking.

"Oh, welcome home, Shirou. Hm? What's with that surprised face?
 Did something happen?"
She must've been mixing flour, as she puts a bowl she's been mixing onto the table.

"YeahI am surprised.
 Um, everything's so different."
Actually, I don't remember how many years it's been since I last saw her doing something like cooking.

"Different...? Oh, you must mean Sakura-chan.
 She went home. Someone from her house called her and she had to go home."

"...I see. So Shinji must've called here."
It's needless help, but I guess he wanted to take care of it as quickly as possible.
"Shinji-kun? Hm, oh well."
After tilting her head in question, Fuji-Nee goes back to the kitchen.


...I'm a bit curious.
It's not completely dark yet, so I
I have to find out what Fuji-Nee's up to.
For the peace of our dinner, and for Saber, who's secretly looking forward to it!

"Excuse me... Oh, okonomiyaki? Are you hungry?"
"You're wrong. Sakura-chan left me in charge, so I'll be cooking tonight. I'll cook for all three of us, so can you go wake Saber-chan up?"


Wow, I'm surprised.
I don't know about her choice of food, but Fuji-Nee's acting like a woman, huh?

"Yeah. You should be able to cook if you're that old. Huh...? Why are you cooking rice, Fuji-Nee? You don't need rice with okonomiyaki."

"We do. I'm making kani-tama, so it'll just be an omelet if we don't have rice."
Fuji-Nee cracks open an egg as she says so.
The egg drops into the flour she's been mixing.


...I'm surprised.
It seems kani-tama and okonomiyaki are the same in Fuji-Nee's head.

"Fuji-Nee. I know you'll realize your mistake in a few minutes, but I'll come out and tell you."
"Uh... W-What? All right, tell me."
She must think something's wrong as well.
She looks at me with respect.

"Well. That's not kani-tama. It'll be a horrifying dish where you'll be putting okonomiyaki on top of rice. So let's remake this."
I clearly tell her.

"Hmm... Isn't it the same putting omelet or okonomiyaki on rice, kitchen chief?"
"No. First of all, I'm not a kitchen chief. We'll give Saber a wrong impression of Japanese food, so let's remake this."
I take the bowl away from Fuji-Nee.

"Ehn-no! I mixed it, so we can't waste it!"

"No, I'll make some snacks with this later, so this is going into the fridge.
 You go crack about five eggs and mix them thoroughly. Oh, the crab and the bamboo shoots are ready? Then I'll make the sauce. I'll let you cook it.
 It's all right. If I preheat the pan, even you can do it."

Well.
Now that it's decided, I'll need potato starch, ginger, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar

"...? What? I told you to do the eggs. Don't mix them too fast, okay? Use a chopstick and use the whole bowl to mix them."

I don't know if she's listening or not, as she's just looking at me like she wants to say something.
Then.

"Ehehe. You have dignity in the kitchen."
Saying so, she opens the refrigerator.
"Hm..."
Well, I'm glad to hear that, but is it a good thing that it's only in the kitchen?
...Yeah.
I'll go check on Sakura before the sun sets.

"I'm going to take a walk. I don't know what's up with you, but I'll leave dinner up to you."
"All right, take care. Dinner's going to be a delicious kani-tama."
Kani-tama, huh?
I guess even Fuji-Nee should be able to make that.

I go up the hill tinted by the sun.
Sunset is early during winter.
I have to go to Sakura's house quickly and check up on her.

"Oh, Senpai? Why are you here at this time?"
"Ohwell, I was just close by, so I thought I'd drop in."
"'Just close by', huh? All right, I'll say that's the case."

My bewilderment must have been funny, as Sakura smiles.
It's a big smile, and it doesn't look like Shinji's forcing her.

"Sakura. I really don't have any business here, but where's Shinji?
 Is he home right now?"
"Nii-san? No, I don't think he's home yet."

"He's not home...? Then who called my house? Weren't you told to come back here by Shinji?"
"Huh...? Fujimura-Sensei only told me that I should go home since my grandfather's waiting."


I see.
...But it is true that Shinji hasn't done anything to Sakura.
Shinji's her brother after all.
He would never involve such a good sister in this battle between the Masters.

...And there's one thing I have to tell her so I don't involve her in this mess.


We look at each other, dumbfounded.
We stare at each other for about ten seconds.

"U-Um... It's a bit disappointing, but it relieves me to hear that from you. I was told to stay at the house and not go anywhere during the night for a while."

"Y-Yeah, you're right. It's getting dangerous recently, so we should've done so earlier."

"Yes. I won't be able to go to your house for a while.
 It's disappointing, but it'll all go back to normal if I endure it for just a short while. Please come see me at the archery club until then, Senpai."

Sakura bows and goes back into her house.

I manage to make it back before dinner.
An angry swordsman awaited me at the entranceand I told her what happened today, about how we eliminated the boundary field at school, and how Tohsaka is expecting a counterattack tomorrow.

...I don't tell her about Shinji.
I don't want her to consider him as an enemy until I figure out his true intentions.

"I understand. Then let us eat, Shirou. Taiga has made dinner and has been waiting."
She must be hungry, as Saber quickly makes her way to the living room.

"I see. I haven't eaten anything she's made since we were kids."
I'm half scared and half looking forward to it.

...Man.
Who could have imagined that it was going to turn into such a disaster...?
"I'm going to go talk to Saber. I don't know what's up, but I can leave you in charge of dinner, right?"
"Yup. Look forward to the delicious kani-tama I'll be making."

"......"
I am a bit worried, but kani-tama is like an omelet, so Fuji-Nee should be able to handle it.

"I just got home, Saber."
I take my shoes off as I go into the dojo.

"Welcome home, Shirou. It seems nothing much has happened today."
Saber must like the atmosphere, since she's always here.

I match Saber and sit Japanese-style to tell her what happened todayabout how we eliminated the boundary field at school, and how Tohsaka is expecting a counterattack tomorrow.

"...I see. So the battle with the Master is tomorrow? Then I shall sleep well tonight and save my energy."

I nod back.
I know I'm being too optimistic, but I don't tell her about Shinji.
I don't want her to consider him as an enemy until I figure out his true intentions.

"But Shirou. Should you be here when it is almost time for dinner?"
"Well, I came to report to you because I don't have anything to do and there's time until dinner.
 It's not bad to relax until dinner once in a while."

"What...? Then you are not making dinner tonight...!?"
"Eh...? T-That's true, but is there a problem with that? Fuji-Nee's working hard, so I don't want to interrupt her."

"...Hmmm... Taiga's will to cook should certainly be respected. But... um, so you will not be helping her...?"

"Nope. It's all right. Fuji-Nee's a grown woman, so she should be able to make some kani-tama.
 She might even be better than me. She has an A-rank in unexpectedness, after all."

I give her a weird explanation.
But Saber frowns.
"...All right. I shall believe your words over Taiga's.
 ...Let me make sure. I can trust you, right?"
She makes sure with a threatening tone.

"Y-Yeah. You can trust me."
"...I heard that. Please do not forget the oath you made."
Saber relaxes her shoulders.

...Man.
Who could have imagined that this was going to lead to such a disaster...?
It's time for dinner.
Fuji-Nee's special kani-tama bowl is ready on the table.
It's a simple dish where there's rice in the bowl and kani-tama put on top of it.
It looks like there's a yellow lid on the bowl, and it honestly doesn't look good.

But it should make the rice taste better since it's in a bowl.
It's like katsu-bowl and teriyaki-bowl.
There's no way it can taste bad because the good taste of the ingredients seep into the rice.
The only drawback is that the taste is simple, but that's a small price to pay.

"Itadakimasu."
"All right, itadakimasu."
"Itadakimasu."
We bow and dig into our food.

Then.
The food isn't soft like kani-tama. No, it feels strange like I'm eating a main dish.

"N-NO WAY!?
 We have an emergency!! The kani-tama turned into something else in under a minute...!!!"

"........."
...This isn't an emergency or anything.
This is more like an okonomiyaki bowl.

"Hey, how did this happen!? I made it just like I was told!!"
"...Wow. Did the people at the Fujimura family teach you how to make this?"

"Yeah. I told them I'll be making a big omelet, so they gave me flour and other stuff."
"......"

I wanted her to realize the mistake right then.
I thought that being able to make an omelet was a function every human being was born with.
Kani-tama is just a variant of an omelet.
It was my mistake to assume that Fuji-Nee couldn't mess up something like that.
That's right, Fuji-Nee can't even cook an omelet...!

"Shirou."
...Then.
I hear a voice filled with disappointment.
"Saber...?"
I slowly turn to her.

"Shirou. This is hard to eat even for me."
...Crap... It's hard to tell, but it seems Saber's mad...

...The hellish dinner ends and it's time for a strategy meeting.
But I've already reported to Saber about what happened today.
Since it's likely that there'll be a fight tomorrow, we should be preparing.

"Then we will not be going out tonight?"
"No. It might be vexing for you, but sit tight for tonight. I don't intend to fight needless battles, and also, we're not in a condition to be fighting freely."

I'm inexperienced as a Master, and Saber has a limit to how many times she can fight since I'm not giving her any magical energy.
We can't be leisurely looking for Masters in our situation.

"...I understand. You certainly do have a point. It is not proactive, but we do need the utmost care for victory."

"But. If you have a will to fight, we cannot spend time leisurely. If we are to stay here tonight, we should use this time to train."

Saber stares at me.
She doesn't even need to tell me.
I brought Saber to this dojo with that in mind.

"I know. Do you remember what happened last night?
 We trained a bit since you told me I was slacking off for coming home late last night.
 ...That was a good lesson for me. No matter what I do, I can't beat someone I can't beat. I couldn't realize such a simple thing until I fought you."

"With that in mind, I think it's important to train with you.
 I don't know how effective it'll be, but I should be able to survive longer in battles if you train me hard."

"Then Shirou..."
"Yeah. Can you train me whenever we have the time?
 For today, that'll be until we go to bed."

I take the shinai on the wall.
...It's still eight o'clock.
There's still four hours until bedtime, so I'll train my heart... out!?

"H-Hold on, Saber!!"
I stop Saber since I feel my life's in danger.
Because as Saber turns to me...
"What is it? It seems you would like to train your readiness for battle, so I am only answering your enthusiasm."
She is obviously ready to kill me.

"Let us start our training, Shirou.
 I shall take that dullness out of you first. You should be alert so that something like tonight will never happen again."
So she is mad about dinner...!

"W-What is that!? That was all Fuji-Nee's fault!
 A-And even though you complained, you ate all of it"

"Please do not make excuses.
 By the way, Shirou. I will tell you before you faint. That was out of necessity. Please do not forget that."

"Oh"
...Saber disappears.

Oh man.
So I'll go through four hours of torture now, huh? .................Grudges over food sure are scary.
Dinner's over.
I finish cleaning up after dinner and face Saber in the dojo.
I tell her what happened todayabout how we eliminated the boundary field at school, and how Tohsaka is expecting a counterattack tomorrow.

...I don't tell her about Shinji.
I don't want her to consider him as an enemy until I figure out his true intentions.

"Then we will not be going out tonight?"
"No. It might be vexing for you, but sit tight for tonight. I don't intend to fight needless battles, and also, we're not in a condition to be fighting freely."

I'm inexperienced as a Master, and Saber has a limit to how many times she can fight since I'm not giving her any magical energy.
We can't be leisurely looking for Masters in our situation.

"...I understand. You certainly do have a point. It is not proactive, but we do need the utmost care for victory."
"But. If you have a will to fight, we cannot spend time leisurely. If we are to stay here tonight, we should use this time to train."

Saber stares at me.
She doesn't even need to tell me.
I brought Saber to this dojo with that in mind.

"I know. Do you remember what happened last night?
 We trained a bit since you told me I was slacking off for coming home late last night. ...Well, it was more like you were beating me up."

"......! That is because Taiga told me that I had to go hard on you or you would not listen to me. It is not because I was angry yesterday"
Saber says so in a panic.

"No, it's fine. ...That was a good lesson for me.
 No matter what I do, I can't beat someone I can't beat.
 I couldn't realize such a simple thing until I fought you."


"With that in mind, I think it's important to train with you. I don't know how effective it'll be, but I should be able to survive longer in battles if you train me hard."

"Then Shirou..."
"Yeah. Can you train me whenever we have the time?
 For today, that'll be until we go to bed."

I take the shinai on the wall.
...It's still eight o'clock.
There's still four hours until bedtime, so I'll train my heart out.
"Ouch... Man, Saber never went easy on me..."
I get into my futon.
My body is covered in bruises and pain-killing patches, and I'm sure it'll all be sore tomorrow.

"I'm tired."
I take a breath.
I trained my "strengthening" magic after Saber's training, and I'm tired both physically and mentally.

Saber and Fuji-Nee are sleeping in a room a bit away from here, but I don't care.
I'm just tired.
I'll sleep for now and prepare for tomorrow

...Am I dreaming?
My mind's dozing off.
My body's asleep and I can't move a finger.
Thenthis has to be a dream.

...It's a dark night.
My ears are ringing.
My feet are asleep, but I'm walking down the hill.

It's cold.
The wind is blowing on me, and since I'm in my pajamas, my body is freezing.
...This coldness is unlike Fuyuki City.
The chill would be cold enough to wake me up if this were a dream.

I walk through the empty town.
The annoying sound won't stop.
Ignoring my shivering body, my feet are moving toward somewhere.

"Oh."
I try to scream and realize that my throat is frozen.
This isn't a dream.
This can't be a dream.
But my mind's still asleep.
My limbsthey aren't following my orders, and they are walking on as if manipulated by something.

"Oh"
This must be the destination.
My feet move faster as they move up the stairs
The ringing in my ears turns into a voice.

"!"
No, that's wrong.
The sound hasn't changed at all.
It has been repeating the same thing over and over.
Come.
What fills my head is a female voice filled with magical energy.

I see the mountain gate.
Something's on the other side.
And...
If I cross that gate, I won't come out alive.

"!"
I don't know what it is, but my dozing mind screams out for me to run away.
Go back.
Go back.
Go back.
Stop. You can still make it. Wake up and go back. Wake up, wake up, wake up, don't listen to that voice...!!!!!
"......Oh!"
My consciousness wakes up.
My head clears and my will finally returns.

But it's too late.
My limbs don't obey me as they go through the mountain gate.
The only certain thing is my mind.
My body does not listen to my will and walks into the Ryudou Temple following the voice.

The temple is covered in darkness.
In the center stands "something" with an inhuman magical energy.

The figure wavers like a mirage.
The shadow reminding me of Death strips off the darkness and
The figure becomes a witch like one would see in a fairy tale.

"Stop right there, boy.
 I will kill you if you come any closer."
A sneering laugh.
...It seems my body is under her control.
My feet that never stopped freeze at the command.


My consciousness wavers.
My limbs still do not move, and an unknown "enemy" is standing before me.
...Yes, she's an enemy.
I can be sure of that.

She's a Servanta heroic spirit that excels the most in magic out of the seven Servants
"...Servant Caster...!"
I move my throat with all my effort and glare at my enemy.

"Yes, that's right, boy. Welcome to my temple. I welcome you, Saber's Master."
Her cool voice is mocking me.

"!"
I put power into my legs, but my body will not move.
Damn, what the hell am I doing...!?
I've been lured here, and on top of that, I can't move a muscle...!

"Ahkuh!"
I concentrate on my limbs with all my power.
I don't know what kind of a trick it is, but it has to be her magic that's restraining me.
Then if I can extract her magical energy out of my body...!

"You think you can free yourself? How cute of you. You're going to kill my spell with such a method? How naive."
"What?"

I concentrate all my will to search throughout my body.
Caster's magical energy...
The enemy's magical energy that's inside me, restraining my body.

...I look inside my body while keeping my eyes open.
It's all right. It's nothing difficult if I'm calm.
I identify the flow of magical energy every night.
I just have to do what I've been doing and identify Caster's poison inside of me.
Even if I can't get it out of my body, I can concentrate it into one of my limbs so that I can move the other three

"Huh?"
How can this be?
Caster's magical energy is not mixed within me.
The only poison-like element is this one small point on my chest.
But all of my body is acting abnormally.


It's not that there's something wrong with the blood flowing in me.
If there's something abnormal, it's not my blood but the blood vessels themselves.
It's like having my heart locked up.
The red spot on my chest has to be Caster's magical energy.
One cursed word is taking away my body's authority.

"Noway."
It means I was cursed when I was sleeping.
Even if I was asleep, it should have been impossible for me to be seized by a magic cast from so far away.

Magi have magic resistance.
It is the power to repel "magic" such as hypnotism, binding, and coercion.
As long as one is a magus, one cannot be easily controlled by others.

It's a fundamental law.
Magi have Magic Circuits.
The circuit in one's body does not only make magical energy, but it can also repel external magical energy.

Therefore, it is difficult to interfere with someone with a Magic Circuit, and it is difficult even to control a magus several ranks lower than you.
As the Magic Circuit repels external magical energy, magic is destroyed before it can be completed.

For that reason, indirect intervention magic, such as hypnotism and binding, has a low success rate.
Even if the target is not a magus, the magic can be repelled unconsciously if the target has a Magic Circuit.

From that point of view, an intervention of just attacking with pure magical energy like Tohsaka does, making a weapon in this world and attacking the opponent as a result, is a simple method.
Physical impact works on everyone.
It does not matter if the target has a Magic Circuit or not, as people will bleed if they are cut with a knife.


That's why this situation is strange.
...I'm sure I could be affected if I had magic cast on me from close-range.
If I had met Caster before and she had cast "coercion" on me, it's probable that I could be controlled even at a distance.

But I have not met Caster before, nor have I had a curse cast on me.
...So this is our first meeting.
Without moving from here, Caster cast a spell to the faraway Emiya house and controlled my body.

The word "witch" pops into my head.
If she can control a magus's body from a distance of a few kilometers...
Does it not mean that Caster can control everyone in this town from here?

"!"
...My spirits weaken.
As the magic is complete, there's no way I can dispel it.
I can't do anything unless Caster releases me or I get some outside help!

"Do you get it now? It is my magic that is binding you and not my magical energy.
 A completed magic cannot be washed away by water like magical energy.
 It is just like solid and liquid. The solid does not crumble even if water is poured on it, right?"
...The shadow steps closer to me.
The bluish-purple robe melting into the night is smiling.

"But there are exceptions.
 For example... Yes, the magic you people make is like mud buildings to me.
 I can wash it away with a violent water current, even if it may be a solid.
 Do you understand? The difference between us is that great."

"Isee. That's why you brought me here, huh?"

"Yes. All the Masters are weak, but you are the weakest by far.
 Your magic resistance is on the same level as that of the ordinary people in this town.
 It is only natural that I would want to talk to such a Master, you know?"

She smiles.
She shows superiority as if I'm her prey.

"!"
...A chill runs through me.
Don't lie about wanting to talk to me!
She's ready to kill me at any moment!

"See, you're misunderstanding again. Don't worry. I can't suck up your magical energy if I kill you.
 Everyone in this town is mine.
 I have to let them live and have them give me every bit of their magical energy."
Her laugh echoes in my ears.

"What?"
A missing piece fits inside my head.
Did she just say she'll suck up all the magical energy from the people in this town!?

"Caster...! You involved innocent people in this...!"
"Oh, you didn't know? I thought you already knew since you cooperated with that little girlI see.
 You didn't know, huh?"
Caster smiles even more.
It seems like she's pondering how to kill her prey.

"In that case, I shall tell you. I, Servant Caster, have the privilege to make a 'territory'.
 A magus has a workshop, right? It's just like that.
 I constructed a temple in this place to protect myself.
 Fortunately, this land is an unfavorable land for Servants.
 It's excellent as my territory, and most of all, it's easy to collect magical energy from here."

"I couldn't hold back at first since you people only had small amounts of magical energy. But I can collect it pretty well now.
 You can see it, right? The preserved magical energy, pieces of people, in this land collected from hundreds of people."

"Thenthe incidents occurring in town are..."
"Yes. I told you this is my temple, right?
 Then is it not the people's duty to offer me sacrifices?"

"!"
The strange coma incidents happening in town.
I thought there weren't that many victims, but she just said hundreds of people.

When I strain my eyes...
It looks like the swirl of magical energy in this place is made of more than a thousand souls.

"Caster......!!!!!!"
I concentrate all my will into my limbs.
But there's no change, and Caster's standing there as if to make fun of me.

"Well, let us finish our conversation.
 It must be boring for you to stay like that as well."
She whispers into my ear.
At the same timethe enemy I couldn't see fills my vision.

"Saber's Master. I shall take that Command Spell from you.
 ...Saber is too valuable to have disappear.
 I shall have her defeat that annoying Berserker."


Caster raises her arm.
Her fingers are going for my arm

"Take... my... Command Spell?"
Is that possible?
I think Tohsaka said that one needs to pull out the nerves along with the Command Spell

"That's right. I will cut off your arm and transplant the Command Spell to my Master.
 But the Command Spell is one with the owner's Magic Circuit. So taking out the Command Spell means I will be taking out your nerves as well."
Caster says so as if it's nothing at all.

"Wha"
Pull out my nerves?
She'll cut off my arm and take all the nerves in my body with it?
If she does that, I'll

"Yes, you should turn into a vegetable. But you can be assured that I won't take your life."
"!!!!"
I desperately put power into my limbs, but they don't even twitch.
My limbs won't move, and I'm like a prisoner about to be executed...

A bewitching smile.
The glowing fingers reach out for my left hand like a crawling spider

My body feels heavy.
My awakening comes with a headache.

"...I wonder if it's because of the wound from yesterday. My right arm's still hurting."
I murmur while getting up.
It's past six o'clock.

"Crap, I should be making breakfast...!"
I jump out of my futon and change instantly.
Fuji-Nee and Sakura have morning practice.
They'll be leaving here around six-thirty, so I won't make it unless I hurry.

After I see them off, I drink tea with Saber.
Time flies by and it's past seven o'clock before I realize it.

"I'm going now. Take care while I'm gone, Saber."
"Yes. Please be careful yourself as well. Do not do anything reckless, even if you may be with Rin."
"Yeah, I learned that yesterday. I'll ask for your help if I'm to go after an enemy."

I wave goodbye and leave.
The morning air is peaceful.
But the place I'm heading to isn't normal anymore.

"All right."
I get myself mentally ready as I go down the hill.
Tohsaka's acting like a Master, so I should act as one too.

I get to class right on time.
I greet people as I make my way to my seat.
"Huh?"
On my way...
My eyes catch a glimpse of someone and my mind goes blank.

"!"
I don't need to think.
I run straight to Shinji.
"Shinji, you!"

"Hey, Emiya. What's going on? You're looking pretty dangerous. Did something happen to you while I was gone?"
"Shut up. What did you do to Mitsuzuri?"

"Mitsuzuri? Oh, Ayako. I heard she ran away. I heard about it in the range this morning. So she was found in Shinto, huh?"
I don't know what's funny, but Shinji laughs.
It looks like he's sneering at her.

"...Don't play dumb. You're the last one that talked to her. I'm asking you what you did to her then."

"Huh? We only chatted for a bit.
 More importantly, did you hear about it, Emiya!? Ayako was fucked up in the back alley! It must've been rough! I heard her eyes were spaced out and her uniform was messed up.
 Well, I don't know what happened, but it's not something I can ignore, right? I'm kind of curious how that conceited girl got trashed."


"Why the angry face? It's just a joke. Ayako's under care now, right? I think she's staying at her house now. Well, I guess it'll be harder for her once she comes back, because the rumor will have spread by then."

"Shinji. Are you saying you told everyone at the archery range about this?"
"Maybe. But all the first years know about it already. I hear the rumor's been flying around since yesterday."
Shinji sounds happy.


...I clench my fists.
Did he go around and tell everyone such a story?
Mitsuzuri is a girl. Everyone thinks she's strong, but she's still a girl.
So no matter how strong she is, it'll destroy her if such a rumor is spreading.

And he still spread the rumor in spite of that?
He took a secret and spread it irresponsibly!?

"Shinji, you...!"
I grab his shoulder.
"Don't glare at me like that. I said I don't know anything about it. You'll regret it if you hit me for selfish reasons."
Shaking my hand off, Shinji goes to sit down.

The homeroom bell rings.
"
!"
I can't stay standing when everyone's sitting down.
I glare at Shinji one more time and head to my seat.
The day ends.
School's over and the students head home one after another.


I could have questioned Shinji, but I don't have any proof right now.
Even if I told him about seeing him in the woods yesterday, it would amount to nothing if he tells me he just happened to be there.

"...I have to find proof first."
I don't know if he's a Master or not.
But I'm sure he has something to do with Mitsuzuri's case.

"How to identify a Master... I can only strip them and look for the Command Spell, huh?"
Well, I'm sure no Master's going to allow me to do that.

"It's almost time. Tohsaka might know of a good way."
I get up.
I promised Tohsaka I'd meet her in the hallway after school.

I get together with Tohsaka and look around the whole school.
According to Tohsaka, the boundary field has its foundations set up throughout the school.

Tohsaka's been searching and erasing them, but it seems they keep coming back up or new ones are created, preventing Tohsaka from completely eliminating the boundary field.

"The boundary field's already set up.
 What I'm doing is weakening the effect. It's better than nothing, and I'm sure the Master won't activate it until it's complete."
...That's the case according to her.

"Tohsaka. Can I ask you something?"
I call out to Tohsaka after she eliminates the mark on the rooftop.

"What? Do you still feel something strange on the rooftop?"
"Ohno, this is about a different matter. I don't feel anything strange here now. I can't feel anything."

"I see. I guess we've erased all the active marks now.
 You can't sense magical energy, but you're really sensitive to abnormality in the air. I didn't think I'd be able to erase all the marks so fast."

Tohsaka's in a good mood.
I'm happy I got to be of help, but this is no time for that.

"Tohsaka. Can Masters recognize other Masters? Does their presence change even if their Servant is in spirit form?"
"No, but... yes, you can identify a Master if he hasn't done anything to hide it."

"All Masters are magi, so you can find them if you follow the magical energy. Additionally, they've formed a contract with a great familiar called a Servant, so their magical energy will leak even if they hide it."

"You haven't noticed since you're slow, but I leave magical energy behind me. A magus would know right away I'm a Master, and I'm sure I can recognize another Master if I see him or her."

"Really...!? But you didn't know I was a magus. Why is that?"
"What? You want me to say it?"
Tohsaka sounds mean now.
...I have a bad feeling about this.

"No, it's fine. I think I figured it out."
"Smart move. Well, that's how it is. There are people who have small amounts of magical energy that aren't magi. Magi approve others as magi only when they have more than a set amount of magical energy."

"Yeah, yeah. I figured that out.
 ...Oh, then what do you feel from me now?"

"Hmm, you haven't changed at all.
 I heard it was an incomplete summoning, so I bet the connection between you two is small except when healing your wounds.
 Well, I guess that's possible since you're a special case."

...Hm.
Then Shinji isn't a Master.
Even if I can't tell, Tohsaka can identify a Master.
Tohsaka should be able to feel the lingering magical energy if Shinji is a Master with a Servant.

"Oh. You say we have to look for Masters, but it should be easy once we start. We just need to follow the trail of magical energy, right?"

"That's not true. If they have an item that can hide their magical energy, nobody would find out about them.
 ...Well, I think items that can hide a magical energy as large as a Servant are rare, so I don't think any Master has one."

"Then you can't detect a Master even if he's close to you, if he has such an item?"

"Hmm. It would depend on what he has, but I think I'd be able to tell if I go near him. As long as they've formed a contract with a Servant, friction with the world will occur."

"If I can't identify a Master even when I'm near him, it means that the Master isn't using his Servant.
 Well, I guess there are exceptions, but that'll be the case nine times out of ten."

We return to the classroom.
Even though we couldn't find any clues about other Masters, it seems Tohsaka's happy that we eliminated a lot of the marks.
She said something about the enemy coming out in the future because we were so active and whatnot.

"You're patient. You don't know how long it'll be before that happens, right?"

"Really? A person who would set up a boundary field like this won't just stay quiet if something like this happens. I'm guessing he or she will come out tomorrow.
 This person won't let the same thing happen twice."
Tohsaka sneers at the Master we have yet to see.

"Hmm. So that's how it is?"
"Yup. Well, I have some things to do, so I'll be going home now. I have to buy a lot of stuff in preparation for tomorrow."

"I'll see you tomorrow. Go home early today, okay? Go straight home."

"Hm? Oh, you're worrying about me?"
"...! N-No, it just screws up my plans if my ally dies! I'm just making sure!"

Tohsaka says so quickly.
Her panic is so unlike her, and it's obvious that she's only hiding her embarrassment.
I see.
I'm beginning to understand more about Tohsaka.

"Anyway! You're too defenseless, so don't do careless things! I'm an exception, but other Masters will kill you in a matter of seconds!"
Tohsaka looks away and tries to leave.

"Oh"
Seeing her leave, I suddenly...
"Tohsaka. Is Archer by your side?"
...Murmur something meaningless.

"He is. What? Do you need to talk to him?"
"...No. I'm just wondering if you two are getting along."
Tohsaka looks back at me in wonder at the sudden question.

Then.

"Ohhh, I see.
 You don't need to worry. He's a good guy even though he's rebellious. He's immature in spite of his looks, and he's fun to be with."

Saying so happily, Tohsaka disappears down the stairs.
Mitsuzuri's case might still be affecting me, as I am at the archery range before I know it.
The range is far from the school building and seems deserted.
The club activities are over, so there's nothing to find here.

"......I guess I'll go home."
I turn around and head to the gate.
And between me and the gate...
...Stands Matou Shinji, as if to block my way.

"Hey, you're going home this late? Weren't all students supposed to go home immediately since it's getting dangerous recently?"

I don't think I can be calm facing Shinji here.
I ignore him and keep walking.

"I see. You're so tired that you can't even greet your friend, huh?
 You're tired because you're doing meddlesome things like destroying the spells."
His voice sounds delighted.
"!"
I jump back and ready myself.

"Spellif you're using that word, then..."
I glare at Shinji.

"Yup, that's right. The boundary field that you thoroughly eliminated is a security measure I set up.
 If you destroy it like that, I'll be so scared that I won't be able to come to school anymore."


...I see.
So this is how stupid I am.
I knew about it when I saw Shinji in the woods, but I rejected the idea because I was unprepared for the truth.

"Hold on. Don't be on guard like that. Since that annoying Tohsaka's gone, let's talk things over as men. As you know, I don't like fighting."
"Talk things over...? You don't want to fight me?"

"Of course not.
 I'm guessing you were forced to be this Master thing as well, right?
 It happened to me too. I was forced to be a Master even though I'm not a magus, nor do I have a will to fight."

"I'm trying to find a way to get through this without fighting anybody. So that's why I have no intention of fighting you."

"...I see. Then what's up with that boundary field? You're saying you don't want to fight even though you have such a thing set up?"

"Are you stupid? That's for my protection. There's a pure magus named Tohsaka in this school.
 She won't hesitate to fight. Since I'm not a magus, I have to set up protection for myself.
 That boundary field is set up for that purpose alone. I won't activate it as long as I don't get attacked."


...He's making sense.
I don't know if Shinji is really a Master or not, or how he became one.
But I can trust his story.
If Shinji says so, I should believe him.
But before that

"Shinji. Are you the one that attacked the female student yesterday?"
I have to get this question answered.

"...Oh, that? I couldn't help it.
 My Servant's unmanageable, and she attacks people if I let her be.
 I'm just a normal person. I'm not a magus like Tohsaka, so it's hard for me to get her to obey me."

"Then what happened yesterday is an accident? Your Servant did it herself?"

"Yeah, I'll be careful from now on. I don't want anything happening here either. I'll make sure the only thing she does is to protect me."

"You swear that's true, Shinji?"

"Yeah. Why would I lie? I could've kept it a secret, but I told you about it.
 You were getting suspicious of me, right? I'll have to fight back if you attack me, so I came out with it before that happened.
 I don't want to fight anybody."

...I can't trust everything he says.
But if Shinji really thinks soeverything would work out.

"All right, I'll believe you. If you're not going to do anything, I won't do anything to you either. That's fine, right, Shinji?"

"Good, you're understanding for once.
 But that's not good enough. Can't you tell why I came here to talk?"

Shinji holds out his hand.
So that means...

"Do you want to cooperate with me, Emiya? I'm sure you don't know, but the Matou family is a family of magi.
 ...Well, magic died out in my father's generation, but we still have the knowledge. How does it sound? I'll be helpful to an inexperienced Master like you, right?"


The Matou line is a family of magi...?
Tohsaka didn't say such a thing.
No, she must have excluded him since magic died out in his father's generation, like he said.

"So, what do you say? We can survive through the Holy Grail War if we cooperate. You shouldn't even need to think about it."


His hand is held out.
...Shinji's proposal isn't bad.
It makes sense, and it's a viable option.
But

"...Shinji. Does Sakura know that you're a Master?"

"Huh? You really must be an amateur, Emiya.
 Listen, a family of magi only teaches its secrets to the eldest son. Other children are just spare organs.
 It's meaningless to teach magic to such a thing, and it's a waste of time.
 ...Geez. A slow woman like her wouldn't be able to use magic.
 I'm the only one that inherited the secret."


I see.
That's really good.
Sakura shouldn't be involved in all this.
I want her to be smiling happily all the time.

"Shinji. If you won't do anything to me, I won't do anything to you. That's good enough, right?"

"......I see. So you won't cooperate with me?"

"We don't need to, right? If we're not going to fight, cooperation's meaningless.
 If you only want to protect yourself, have the church take care of you until the Holy Grail War ends. You know that, right?"

"...Oh. What is this? Are you trying to win this war?"


...I have no intention of fighting.
But I'll fight anyone that attacks me, and I can't just ignore people that'll bring disaster to this town.
And

"...I won't kill people. But I have to see what the Holy Grail really is. To do so, I have to survive until the end, right?"
I turn my back to Shinji.

"I see. So you're going to fight no matter what, huh?
 It has nothing to do with me, but you're not intending to involve Sakura in this, are you?"

"There's no way I'll let her get involved. You're going to hide this from her too, right?"

"Of course. But as her brother, I can't let her stay at a house with a guy who's going to fight.
 If you're going to fight, I won't let Sakura out of my place until the Holy Grail War ends. That's fine, right, Emiya?"


...Shinji does have a point.
As long as I'll be fighting, my house is in danger.

"All right, I'll tell Sakura. Is that good for you, Shinji?"

"Okay. I'm glad you're so caring.
 To be honest, I was scared if you were going to hold her hostage. Well, my problem is solved for now."
I don't know what's funny, but Shinji laughs.

"That's all I have to say. I'm going home."
"Go ahead. Oh, but you know that this is our secret, right? I came out with this secret since you're my friend. I don't know what I'll do if you go and tell somebody about this."

That must mean he'll activate the boundary field if I tell Tohsaka about this.

"Yeah, I won't tell anyone. But it's a different story if she finds out herself. I'm going to help her as much as I can. I won't stop her from fighting you if she finds out about you.
 ...So if you don't want to be found, don't do anything."

I head to the gate for real.
The school building is tinted by the setting sun...
Shinji sees me off without a word.
I am dreaming.

Using a small connection like a blood vessel, I see a memory that I cannot reach.

It is his memories.
At the very least, it's not mine.
This is someone else's story.
It's so long ago that he doesn't even recall it.
It's so old that he doesn't even try to recall it.
It's so ancient that he cannot recall it.
It is...
A heavy burden of a contract that has been established and cannot be withdrawn.

It's not like he wanted something.
If anything, he was the kind of guy that could not put up with anything.
He cannot put up with having people cry around him.
He cannot put up with having people get hurt around him.
He cannot put up with having people die around him.
That's the only reason he had.
And for that reason only, he tried to help everybody in his sight.

He was clumsy, and it made you worry if you were looking at him.
But he would accomplish it in the end, and I think he changed a lot of people's lives.
I'm sure his life was a happy one.
His clumsy battles were not meaningless.
He was able to save people proportional to how much he got hurt and how many times he faced death.

...But there's one pitfall there.
I said everybody in his sight.
But one can never look at oneself.
So, in the end.
He could not save the most important person of all, himself.

I don't know how it ended up like that.
No, it should be the other way around.
It was a wonder that it didn't end up like this earlier.
Anyway, it was a terrible disaster.
A lot of people died, and a lot of people were facing death.
Something that could not be solved with his powers alone.
With many deaths in front of him, he...

"Let me make a contract. I shall give you my life after my death. I would like the compensation now."

Yes, he made a contract with something as mysterious as the world.
Throwing away himself to save people.
It is the birth of a hero.

That's all.
There's nothing after that.
Even if he is called a hero, it doesn't change what he does.
From the beginning, it was not his objective to be a hero.
It's just that he needed the power of a hero in the process.

But his end came rather quickly.
An excellent savior is nothing but a nuisance for the people that are not getting saved.

He understands his own powers and the extent of the world.
He accepts what can be saved and what cannot be saved.
That's why he wanted at least the people in his sight to be happy.
A lot of people called it hypocrisy.
Many despised it as an extreme value.
The way he silently pursued his ideal was something he should've been proud of.

But in the end...
He met an uncompensated end, as the contract promised.

He reaches the place.

He had friends and a lover.
He lost all of them, and he was cornered by the ideal he pursued.

He had no place to go.
He was burdened with many voices of resentment, but still kept fighting.
He knew of his fate, but he acted like he tried to perform "miracles" using his fate as a support.

...But that comes to an end.
The place he reaches at the end is a hill of swords.
His battle ends on the hill among the rusted, ownerless steel.

Still alone.
But he smiles in satisfaction as he lets go of the sword.
As if saying there is nothing to regret if he was able to save everybody that came into his sight...
How long has it taken her to notice that something is wrong?

She wakes up to a strange feeling and goes out into the hallway.
"......Shirou?"
She first thinks that the feeling might be coming from her master.
It is because the strange feeling is coming from Emiya Shirou's room.

"...Geez. Is he still training magic?"
The golden-haired girlSaber sighs.
It's good that he's enthusiastic, but he will collapse unless he rests while he can.
And when she decides to go warn him, she realizes her own mistake.


She gasps after confirming it.
The strange feeling isn't coming from Shirou's room.
Under the moonlight...
A string, thin as her hair, runs through the darkness.

The string is going into Shirou's room from outside.
A thin string that even the boundary field here did not catch.
If one is to give praise to the one who pulled off such a thing, one also needs to give praise to Saber for noticing such a thing.


There's no time to think.
The girl turns into a knight in an instant and runs outside.

She runs through the empty town.
There's no hesitation in Saber as she runs.
She knows where she must go.
She only needs to follow the string, the beat of her master.
The only thing she has to do is to run as fast as she can.
It makes no difference whether her destination is the enemy's territory nor how many traps might await her.
She has sworn to protect her master.
So anything that might befall her is negligible.


It is a mountain stained with vast amounts of magical energy.
Ghosts of the dead are flying above like crows, and the trees are covered with invisible blood.
The collected magical energy, the stolen souls, remains here, and the mountain should consume anyone that may approach it.
If there is such a thing as a place to die, this place is a perfect example.


She goes in without hesitation.
She had no intention to stop from the start.
If this place is hell, she has to save her master all the more.
She runs up the stone stairs.
The traps she had anticipated are not there.
The mountain gate is within her view, and she should reach it with one more kick from her magical energy-filled legs.

But her advance stops right there.
Noit is stopped by the "enemy".

On the stairs leading to the mountain gate...
Stands a Servant.
His name is Sasaki Kojirou.
Servant Assassin, the protector of the Ryudou Temple, wielding the longsword Monohoshizao.


Saber's mind is disturbed as she readies her "Invisible Air".
Her Master is on the other side of that mountain gate.
But the Servant in front of her is way too strange.
He reveals his true name willingly.
He does not have a stance, and his cool enmity is transparent.


She cannot figure out his power because of his transparency.
She can see his power as a Servant.
Assassin is not a strong Servant, so it should be easy to defeat him. But her instincts are telling her something different...
That she cannot beat him in a normal duel.

"I do not have any business with you. Move, Assassin."
She suppresses the strange unease and glares at Assassin.
There's only one more step until they are both within range.
Up or down.
If either one moves, a fatal attack should be executed.

"Did you not hear me? I told you to move, Assassin."
Her final warning.
The swordsman with a longsword calmly responds to her words.
"I see. So you would like to pass this mountain gate, Saber?"

Her green eyes glare at Assassin for asking such a foolish question.
He must like the answer.
The longsword dances through the night in an arc.
"Then force your way through. You should hurry, or your master's life will be gone."
He laughs in a cool manner.
"Assassin!"
Saber charges in reply.
The longsword comes down at her at the same moment, and she repels it with her invisible sword.

The clash of the swords echoes through the summit.
Their powers are equal.
But that is not an advantage for her.
"Kuh"
She's impatient.
The enemy she must quickly defeat is a strong one that would be hard to beat even without any time constraints.

"Shirou, please!"
She grits her teeth and prays in her head.
That opening, that excess part of her, is permeating her body.
The battle does not end.
The mountain gate is too far away.

I get to school an hour late.
The hallway's filled with students because it's breaktime.
The class must have just ended for 2-C, as many familiar people are coming out of the classroom.

"Yo. I don't know why, but Tiger was really pissed. You should be prepared for it in the fourth period."
"...Oh yeah. We have English today."

I greet the classmate that gives me the ominous news.
The instant I get to the door to go into my classroom...
"Hm?"
The world history teacher comes out.

"Good morning, Sensei."
"You were late, Emiya? We went over what would be covered in the exam. Be sure to get it from a friend later."
"O-Okay. I'm sorry for being late."

Kuzuki nods and leaves.
He's Kuzuki Souichirou, the iron teacher that teaches world history and philosophy, and is also in charge of the student council.
He's just as he looks, and he's a rare teacher that gains popularity as the students progress through school.

"Morning."
I go to my desk while greeting my classmates.
For a few seconds, I regret that I was late...

"Hey. You're here pretty late."
"?"
Someone greets me, so I turn around.
Then.
There's Shinji, strangely friendly.

"...Shinji? What's wrong? You're acting strange.
 Did you not get enough sleep last night?"
I tell him what I'm thinking.

He completely changes and glares at me... then he smiles again.
Shinji was strange yesterday, but he's even stranger today.

"Shinji? Don't tell me you were attacked. Damn, I told you so. If you're not going to fight, you should stay at home."
"......Shut up. Why are you talking like you're the boss?"
"...Shinji?"

"Or what? Are you conceited because you're friends with Tohsaka? ......Don't misunderstand, okay? It doesn't mean you're strong even if you cooperate with Tohsaka. I know you're happy that you got a strong Servant, but it's shameful to be conceited."

Shinji glares at me.
It doesn't seem like he has much composure.
"Oh well, it's good that you came. See, it would've been boring if you didn't come."
That must be all he wanted to say, as Shinji goes back to his seat, chuckling.

The classroom gets loud once it's lunchtime.
"Huh? Issei's already gone."
He must have gone to the student council room again because of his lack of sleep thing.
I made lunch today, so I would like to avoid eating it in the classroom

"Hm?"
The guys in the classroom are making a commotion.

"Hey, what's going on?"
I call out to them.
The guys that are secretly talking look at me with suspicious eyes.

"This is no time for questions. Look outside the classroom. But secretly, okay?"
...Gotou must have watched some strange TV program last night.

"What?"
Then.
Outside the classroom in the hallway is a person that's acting more suspiciously than Gotou and the others.

"It's Tohsaka from 2-A. Does she have some business in our classroom?"
"She has to. I've been peeking at her for a while, and she's been doing the same. She's peeking into our classroom in a casual yet bold manner. She passed our door seven times. No, that makes eight now."

"...Yeah, this can't be just coincidence. Is it just me or does she look like she's glaring? Doesn't she usually look calmer?"
"Oh, you think so too? Yeah, she's getting angrier the more she stays out there. It's harder to go near her now.
 She must be irritated. Is something annoying her?"

"It seems like the person she's waiting for isn't noticing her, rather than not being here yet. It's like she hid a birthday present for someone, and she's really pissed now because that person hasn't noticed it even after a year."
"...Gotou, you give ridiculous examples. You're too accurate.
 What were you? A general in your previous life?"

...The guys are saying whatever they want.
"......"
I timidly look out into the hallway again.

She's pissed.
I don't know what she's mad about, but I think Gotou-kun is right.


Well.
What should I do?
...Tohsaka must want to talk to me.
But I'm curious why she's acting that way.
Considering Tohsaka, she would drag me out if she has business with me. So why is she acting like an ordinary schoolgirl?

"...I want to ignore her, but I guess I can't... More than anything, I'm scared of what she'll do to me if I do ignore her."
I get up with my lunchbox.
I prepare myself for the questioning I'll get from the guys after I get back.

"Tohsaka. What are you doing here?"
"I-I'm taking a walk! It's natural for me to eat lunch during lunchtime, right?"

...Tohsaka's acting too suspicious.
She's restless and doesn't try to look me in the eyes.

"Oh, okay. Then you can continue with your walk.
 I'm going to go eat in the student council room."
I wave her goodbye and turn around.

"H-Hold on! You're doing this on purpose, right!?"
"?"
I turn around.

"Hey now, Tohsaka. I don't know what happened, but I don't understand it like that. If there's something you want to tell me, go ahead."

Tohsaka's looking at me hesitantly.
...Hmm.
Could it be...?

"Did you forget your lunch money? I can't give you my lunch, but I can lend you some money."
"......! You're so wrong, you idiot!!"

Tohsaka barks out.
The hallway goes quiet.
After a few seconds, everything resumes as if nothing has happened.


...I see. Everyone protected their reality by ignoring what happened.
There's no way that the perfect, beautiful honor student, the school idol, Tohsaka Rin, would scream out the word "idiot" in the hallway.
Therefore, what happened in the past minute was completely erased from their memory.

"......"
...I envy them.
I want to amend my memory from about four days ago.

"So? If it's not lunch money, what is it?"
"Uh... Y-You're having lunch now, right? Do you want to come with me? I know a better place than the student council room."

Tohsaka says so while looking at me from time to time.
...Oh.
She just wants to talk to me because she wants to have a strategic meeting.

Wait.
This is a "better" place?
I don't know what'll happen if I go out into the hallway.
Tohsaka's possible scheming does not even need to be mentioned, but I'll get bashed if the guys see me talking to the class idol, Tohsaka Rin.

"I'll ignore her. I'll pretend I didn't see her."
I take my lunch out of my desk.
...It's dangerous to eat my lunch in the classroom, but it's more dangerous to go out into the hallway and be caught by Tohsaka.

I'll hide myself in this classroom today.
I'm sure Tohsaka won't have the means to break through the impenetrable protection of the lunchtime classroom.

"Huh? Tohsaka-san went back to class A."
"Oh, so we'll never know why she was here?
 ...Well, maybe she was just taking a walk. Tohsaka seems to do crazy things from time to time, right? Do you know the story of how she almost jumped off the rooftop trying to dump a third year that wanted to go out with her?"

"You're wrong. It's the third year that almost jumped off. She said she'd go out with him if he would stand on the edge of the roof for an entire day with her. That guy didn't come to school for days after that.
 ...But I wonder why she did such a thing.
 Tohsaka-san's the type that would come out and say no."

"Oh, that? According to Tohsaka, it's the theory of falling in love on a bridge. She thought she wouldn't be able to love him, so she tried to spend a day with him under a tense state to see if she would fall in love with him. She's amazing, as it's nothing us lowly people would ever think of."

"......"
I stop as I open my lunchbox.
...Tohsaka had such a legend, huh? ...All right, I'll be careful next time I go to the rooftop with her.

"Huh? How fortunate, Tohsaka-san's back!"
"...But she's different now. She was about ready to kill before, but she's so calm now that I feel a chill."
"That's the smile of an angel. I think it shows her determination of 'if that's the way you're going to be, I won't hold back on you either'."

"Hm?"
I feel a terrible chill.
It must be because of Saber's training, as my ability to sense danger is sharper.

"......"
I take a peek out into the hallway.
Tohsaka's standing there smiling with an eraser that she must have brought from her classroom.
At that instant...

The eraser she threw hits me right in the forehead.
"What!? Emiya-kun suddenly flipped over...!?"
"No way! What did you do, Emiya? Was there a banana peel under your chair!?"
"Is that a ninja move!? Is it, Emiya!?"
"Oh... ouch"
Everyone makes a commotion over the strange incident.
They surround me, who's turned over along with my chair, and watch me with worried... no, with curious looks.
"Thanks... Wait, what did it look like to you, Gotou?"
"Hm? You just did something like a flip. It seemed like you did a flip while sitting in that chair."
Gotou-kun requests that I teach him how to do it.
Well, I'm sure it'll be a good laugh if he does a flip like that the instant a teacher points at him, so I can understand how he's jealous of me.
But that's not the problem right now.

The devil that shot the eraser-bullet is looking at me to shoot another one.

"Sorry, Gotou. I'll talk to you later. I have urgent business."
The desk is safe, so I grab my lunch and get up.
...But it hurts.
More so than the hip I hit, the forehead where the eraser hit me is hurting.

"Tohsaka, you...!"
I scream at the shooter while holding on to my red forehead.

"Heh, it's your fault for standing there absent-mindedly.
 It's nice to eat lunch peacefully, but you're in no position to do so, right?"

"Hm... But flipping a person over is doing too much. I would've died if I was unlucky."
"No way. You don't have a body that'll die so easily.
 ...Well, I don't care about that. I want to talk to you, so follow me."

"Talk with me? Are we going to have a strategic meeting?"
"Of course. Let's hurry. We don't have much time since you were taking your time. Lunchtime will end unless we hurry."

She looks away awkwardly and starts walking.
"......?"
Is it just me?
It looks like Tohsaka's not doing well...

So.
She brings me to the empty rooftop.
"Hm, I guess Tohsaka knows a lot of people."
I don't know who she wants to talk to out in the hallway, but it's not something I should butt into and trouble her.
First of all, everyone in this classroomespecially Gotou-kunwill bash me if they see me talking to the classroom idol.

"Let's eat lunch. I have to get some energy in preparation for after school."
I take my lunch out of my desk.
The raiders that usually steal my food are busy watching Tohsaka, so I should be able to eat safely in my classroom today.

"Huh? Tohsaka-san went back to class A."
"Oh, so we'll never know why she was here?
 ...Well, maybe she was just taking a walk. Tohsaka seems to do crazy things from time to time, right? Do you know the story of how she almost jumped off the rooftop trying to dump a third year that wanted to go out with her?"

"You're wrong. It's the third year that almost jumped off. She said she'd go out with him if he would stand on the edge of the roof for an entire day with her. That guy didn't come to school for days after that.
 ...But I wonder why she did such a thing.
 Tohsaka-san's the type that would come out and say no."

"Oh, that? According to Tohsaka, it's the theory of falling in love on a bridge. She thought she wouldn't be able to love him, so she tried to spend a day with him under a tense state to see if she would fall in love with him. She's amazing, as it's nothing us lowly people would ever think of."

"......"
I stop as I open my lunchbox.
...Tohsaka had such a legend, huh? ...All right, I'll be careful next time I go to the rooftop with her.

"Huh? How fortunate, Tohsaka-san's back!"
"...But she's different now. She was about ready to kill before, but she's so calm now that I feel a chill."
"That's a smile of an angel. I think it shows her determination of 'if that's the way you're going to be, I won't hold back on you either'."

"Hm?"
I feel a terrible chill.
It must be because of Saber's training, as my ability to sense danger is sharper.

"......"
I take a peek out into the hallway.
Tohsaka's standing there smiling with an eraser that she must have brought from her classroom.
At that instant...

The eraser she threw hits me right in the forehead.
"What!? Emiya-kun suddenly flipped over...!?"
"No way! What did you do, Emiya? Was there a banana peel under your chair!?"
"Is that a ninja move!? Is it, Emiya!?"
"Oh... ouch"
Everyone makes a commotion over the strange incident.
They surround me, who's turned over along with my chair, and watch me with worried... no, with curious looks.
"Thanks... Wait, what did it look like to you, Gotou?"
"Hm? You just did something like a flip. It seemed like you did a flip while sitting in that chair."
Gotou-kun requests that I teach him how to do it.
Well, I'm sure it'll be a good laugh if he does a flip like that the instant a teacher points at him, so I can understand how he's jealous of me.
But that's not the problem right now.

The devil that shot the eraser-bullet is looking at me to shoot another one.

"Sorry, Gotou. I'll talk to you later. I have urgent business."
The desk is safe, so I grab my lunch and get up.
...But it hurts.
More so than the hip I hit, the forehead where the eraser hit me is hurting.

"Tohsaka, you...!"
I scream at the shooter while holding on to my red forehead.

"Heh, it's your fault for standing there absent-mindedly.
 It's nice to eat lunch peacefully, but you're in no position to do so, right?"

"Hm... But flipping a person over is doing too much. I would've died if I was unlucky."
"No way. You don't have a body that'll die so easily.
 ...Well, I don't care about that. I want to talk to you, so follow me."

"Talk with me? Are we going to have a strategic meeting?"
"Of course. Let's hurry. We don't have much time since you were taking your time. Lunchtime will end unless we hurry."

She looks away awkwardly and starts walking.
"......?"
Is it just me?
It looks like Tohsaka's not doing well...

So.
She brings me to the empty rooftop.
The fifth period is about to end.
Tohsaka's explanation has ended, so I decide to ask her about another magus, about Shinji.

"Hey, Tohsaka. I heard Shinji's familythe Matou family is a family of magi. Did you know that?"

"Yes, I did.
 But my dad told me the Matou family declined in the past few decades. He said that the Matou family doesn't have the bloodline of magi now.
 That's true. That's why I was surprised to hear that Shinji became a Master."

I see, so she did know, huh?
That's to be expected because she supervises this land and knows about all the magi with a history that live here. So she should know that Shinji's a Masterwait, hold on......!!!!!!"

"Tohsaka! You knew that Shinji's a Master!?"
"Ahaha. I'm sorry. I guess my thinking he couldn't be a Master backfired."
Tohsaka says so as if it's nothing.

"......?"
That's strange.
She's looking for the third Master at our school, but it seems like she's not considering Shinji to be a problem at all...

"Tohsaka? Shinji's a Master, right?"
"Yes. But that shouldn't be such a problem. He doesn't have any magical energy, so he shouldn't be able to do anything outrageous.
 Our enemy is the Master hiding at our school. Shinji doesn't have the presence of a Master, so he's not the one we're looking for."

"...? Then does that mean there's actually four Masters at our school?"
"I would think so. Well, I don't think Shinji would interfere since I told him not to do anything."

...She makes another worrisome statement.
No, first of all, how did Tohsaka find out that Shinji's a Master...?

"Tohsaka. Can you tell me what happened this morning in detail?"
"...? There's nothing much to talk about since Shinji was the one who told me.
 He asked me if I wanted to cooperate with him since he's a Master as well."


I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this, but I can't stop her here.

"So what happened after that?"
"I declined, of course.
 ...But he still kept on being persistent. So I unintentionally said that I don't need him since I have you, Shirou."
Tohsaka laughs as if it's a funny story.

"........."
That must be why Shinji was acting strange today.
But

"...So what will you do? Are you going to ignore Shinji? Shinji's the one that set up the boundary field at our school, right?"
"What?"

Tohsaka freezes.
...I thought so. She didn't know Shinji made the boundary field, huh!?

"You're wrong, Tohsaka. Shinji is certainly not a magus. But he's the one that set up the boundary field. I think his Servant excels at magic like Caster"
Tohsaka grows pale.

"Tohsaka. You didn't know?"
"...I did. I knew the boundary field was made by a Servant, but..."
She couldn't make the connection to Shinji, huh?

...I recall how Tohsaka was acting until now.
I bet Tohsaka was so worried about what happened last night that she couldn't think about Shinji.
It must be the biggest mistake she's made in her life.

"Crap, Shinji might be"
She gets up instantly and glares at the exit.
At that instant...
The disorder is revealed, as if it was carefully timed.

"Boundary field!"
The sky is tinted red.
My body is numbed just by breathing in the red air surrounding the school.
...It doesn't affect magi that can create magical energy inside their bodies, but people with scarce magical energy will faint just by breathing it in and should eventually die

"Tohsaka!"
"I know, let's hurry, Shirou!"

The school is red all around.
The hallway is red like blood.
The air is red like blood.
The thick air sticking to my skin makes me hallucinate that this might just be a bad dream.

"Kuh"
Breath filled with hatred escapes my closed mouth.
I pour reasoning onto my confused and heated brain as coolant, and I try to grasp the situation.

I run into the classroom, the one nearest to the stairs.
"......!"
Tohsaka stops for a second, hesitant to enter this disastrous scene.

"!"
...I understand how she feels.
I don't want to encounter such a thing either.

"They're still alive. It doesn't mean we won't make it."
I go near a student and check his pulse and breathing.
...There's no conscious person in this classroom.
Everybody, including the students at their desks and the teacher up front, are down on the floor now.

Most of the students are unconscious, convulsing, foaming at the mouth like it's a bad joke.
...The few others...
A few students have other things happening to them.

...Their skin is melting.
The human skin is slowly melting like mud sliding off of plaster.
The way the melting skin drips onto the floor makes me picture a giant stomach.

Tohsaka is astonished by the horrific scene.

There's no time to think.
To resolve this situation as fast as we can, I should
There's no time to stop and ponder.
If this is a boundary field made by Shinji's Servant, we just have to go get the cause right away...!

"Tohsaka, let's search through the building. We can't have any more victims...!"
I grab Tohsaka, who's still standing still, and run.

"H-Hold on, Emiya-kun. We probably won't make it...! If our enemy's a Servant, we have to have a Servant too, or we'll just get killed even if we find Shinji."

"I-I see. But..."
She says we should call for Saber, but we won't make it if we wait for her to come here...!

"Use your Command Spell. I'll call Archer as well. Saber should be able to come here in an instant if you summon her using your Command Spell."
She says so while biting her lip.
It seems she's got herself together, but her usual cool isn't there yet.

"Hold on. I'll be the only one to use the Command Spell. If there's only one enemy, Saber is enough."
...And...
If this is the doing of Shinji's Servant, our enemy is that black Servant.
I fought her the day before yesterday. Saber should be able to beat that Servant by herself

"Is that fine, Emiya-kun...?"
"Yeah. You used your Command Spell yesterday. So it's my turn today. We can call for Archer if Saber can't handle the situation by herself.
 So, how do I use the Command Spell!?"

"...Concentrate on your left hand. It's better if you close your eyes. Imagine the shape of your Command Spell and release it. Give an order while you release it, of course."

I close my eyes.
I can't take my time.
I eliminate any thoughts in my head as quickly as I can, concentrate on my second Command Spell, "Please. Come, Saber!!!!"
...And I release the Command Spell without any hesitation.

"!"
My hand burns.
At the same time, I feel an unnatural heaviness right beside meand a knight in silver emerges from the heavy "void".

"Saber...!"
"I have come in response to your summons. What is the situation, Master...? It is grave enough for you to use your Command Spell, correct?"

"It's just as it looks. A Servant activated this boundary field.
 I want to remove this boundary field as fast as possible."
"I understand. I certainly feel the presence of a Servant on this floor."

"This floor...!? The Servant's on the fourth floor!?"
"I am sure of it. ...What about it, Rin?"

"Huhno, I'm sure that's the case if you say so, but that's too strange. I can feel that the origin of the boundary field is on the first floor. I'm sure your skill to detect a Servant is superior to mine, but my skill to detect magic is pretty good too."

"...? So you're saying that the Servant is on this floor even though the boundary field was set up on the first floor?"
"Uh... I can't say for sure, but that's what I feel.
 The source of the boundary field has to be on the first floor."


So there are two alternatives, huh?
If Shinji arranged for his Servant to come to this floor, one has to be a trap.
Everyone in this school will pay the price if we make the wrong choice

"Rin. Where is Archer? We can make a better analysis if he is here."
"He's not answering me! This boundary field has us totally cut off from the outside world. I have to use the Command Spell or we'll have to wait for him to detect this and come here."


Tohsaka and Saber glare at each other.
But now's not a time to be doing so.
...Think.
Tohsaka doesn't have her composure.
The best thing we can do right now is
That's the best choice we have.
If Shinji's Servant created this boundary field, I just need to call for Saber!

"Tohsaka, I'm calling for Saber...! Tell me how to use the Command Spell."
"Ehh-hold on, if you're going to call for Saber, I'll also"

"You used your Command Spell yesterday. So it's my turn today.
 We can call for Archer if Saber can't handle the situation by herself! So, how do I use the Command Spell!?"

"...Concentrate on your left hand. It's better if you close your eyes.
 Imagine the shape of your Command Spell and release it. Give an order while you release it, of course."

I close my eyes.
I can't take my time.
I eliminate any thoughts in my head as quickly as I can, concentrate on my second Command Spell, "Please. Come, Saber!!!!"
...And I release the Command Spell without any hesitation.

"!"
My hand burns.
At the same time, I feel an unnatural heaviness right beside meand a knight in silver emerges from the heavy "void".

"Saber...!"
"I have come in response to your summons.

"It's just as it looks. A Servant activated this boundary field.

"I understand. I certainly feel the presence of a Servant on this floor."

Tohsaka and Saber glare at each other.
But now's not a time to be doing so.
...Think.
Tohsaka doesn't have her composure.
The best thing we can do right now is
Tohsaka calls me after dinner.
I guess there wasn't as much damage as we thought there would be at school.
It must be because the one who set up the boundary field, Rider, died quickly.

...I hear the students that were in the same classroom as Rider need to stay in the hospital for a long time, but most students just have anemia.
School's not going to close down, and we'll be having classes like normal tomorrow.

"Shirou, what did Rin say?"
"She said school's going on as normal. So we'll go to school tomorrow and look for Caster's Master."

"...I see. So nobody in that building suffered seriously?"
"Except for a few. Oh, I think Fuji-Nee's not home because she's busy with a staff meeting or something."

"That is good. Knowing Taiga, I am sure she would be sitting at the breakfast table tomorrow like nothing had happened."
Yeah, that's a relief for me as well.
Well, since her energy is extraordinary, I stopped worrying about her when I heard everyone's all right.

"Then Shirou. Continuing that conversation from earlier..."
She leans over the table with a serious face.
"...Ugh. So you haven't given up yet?"

"Of course not. I will sleep in your room so we won't repeat last night's mistake. There is nothing for you to complain about, right?"

I do have complaints.
Having Saber sleep in the same room as me is like telling me to die.

"Shirou. First of all, it is your fault for being affected by such a long-range hypnotism.
 I cannot protect you from Caster's magic, so it is natural for me to at least stay in the same room."

"Magic can be better sensed the closer I am to it. If Caster is to go after you, I must sleep close to you."
"Well, that is a very sound argument, but..."
I think that Caster won't use the same strategy since she failed once.

I think so, but if I say that to Saber right now...
"You are too optimistic! You were deceived by a heretic like Caster and insulted by someone with a twisted personality like Archer because you think like that!"
...I bet she would object like that...

"Are you listening to me, Shirou!? I will not listen to excuses such as me being a woman! I will be sleeping in your room starting tonight, so please do not run away to the shed, okay!?"
Saber glares at me and makes her declaration.

...Ugh, so she even anticipated that I was going to run away to the shed.
I'll hold my ground and try to get her to agree on a compromise.

"All right. I'll have you sleep near me."
"So you finally accept it, huh? Yes, that is the natural choice for a Master."

"But not in the same room. You know there's an empty room next to mine, right? The one on the other side of the sliding screen?"

"...? Yes, I know, but what about it?"
"Um, that place should be good enough to protect me while I'm asleep, right? No, first of all, the enemy won't come in if we're sleeping in the same room.
 So you should stand by in the next room so that you can surprise attack the enemy when they come for me."
Oh, I think this sounds pretty logical.

"That's fine, right, Saber? Honestly, I don't know about two people sleeping in that small room. We can't physically fit. I think it's bad for a Servant to be the cause of her Master's lack of sleep."

"Hm... You are rather witty tonight, Shirou.
 I understand. It sounds like an excuse to me, but I am fine with that. I will compromise on that plan."
Saber reluctantly withdraws.

"Phew."
Good.
Man, being a Master is hard enough.
If I sleep in the same room as Saber on top of that, I bet my brain will overheat.

And the chaotic day comes to an end.

It's becoming more like a habit now as I trained with Saber until eleven and spent an hour doing my routine in the shed.
I get back to my room when the date changes. I hear Saber's breathing from the next room.


My heart jumps at that, but I try to calm down as I get into my futon.
I close my eyes, shake off any wicked thoughts, and tell myself to go to sleep as fast as I can.

".........Man, I can't sleep that easily."
I try not to be conscious of Saber and recall what happened today.
The red school...
The boundary field of blood that would have created lots of victims if we hadn't stopped it.


That causes my restless mind to stop.
The students on the floor of the red classroom.
She was desperately bearing all of it: Rider on the floor and the students that looked like they were dead.

...Oh, I remember now.
At that instant, I figured out the deep part of her.

  I'll kill you the next time we meet.
         Because we're enemies, right?

She acted as a magus, but she never crossed the final line.
She's firm, strong-willed, and magnificent, but she's outrageously good-natured.

That difference must be her burden.
...How clumsy of her.
The more she tries to act as a magus, the more she kills her true self as Tohsaka Rin.

"Oh, wait. I can't be talking about other people."
I sigh and pull the blanket over my head.
...Well...
I guess there's something wrong with me...
...For thinking that I want to be a support for such a perfect girl.
Then.
"Oh. I'm surprised Saber's here."
As we make our way to the back gate, we run into the late-arriving guy.

"Archer...! What are you doing, coming so late!?"
"It is obvious, right? I sensed my master's danger and came here. Well, it seems I was too late. If Saber is here and Rin is safe, everything is over already, right?"

"...! Yes, it's all over already! I'll let you know what happened while you were taking your time, so listen up!"
"...Damn. It seems I came at the worst possible time."

The two argue, leaving us aside.
...Well, it's just that Tohsaka is yelling at Archer while he's just calmly brushing it off.

"Those two are intimate as I thought. Rin is angry because she trusts Archer, and Archer is silently listening because he must feel sorry."

"I know what you want to say. But why are you telling me that, Saber?"
"Well, you had a difficult face, so I merely explained the situation to you."

I don't know what's so funny, but Saber's smiling meaningfully.
"........."
I like it even less.

"Fine, fine. I won't worry about style next time. Let's say it's good for now.
 So. Which Servant was eliminated?"

Archer's expression changes.
His usual ironic composure disappears, and he looks like a cold warrior now.

"...Servant Rider was eliminated. I don't know how it happened, but she must have been defeated by Caster."
"By Caster? Then what happened to Caster? Do not tell me she is unwounded."

"I don't know that either. But Rider was defeated in one blow, so I think Caster's unwounded."
I say so, representing the three of us.

...Then.
"...Humph. What a fool. I guess she was just all talk.
 I did not think she would be able to win, but getting defeated with one blow? Man, show some spirit to at least kill your enemy as well."
He goes back to his usual manner and insults the now-gone Rider.

"Archer. Rider died protecting her Master. You do not have any right to call her a fool."

"Hah, that's what you have to say? A fool is a fool. If she is to call herself a hero, she should be ashamed that she could not even defeat a single enemy. If she can't do that, she should at least sacrifice her life to kill her enemy."

"How convenient of you. She was defeated without doing anything because she was in a situation where she was not able to do so. Speaking ill of her defeat... are you really one to call yourself a hero?"

"Ha. No matter the reason, it makes no difference to the fact that she was defeated badly.
 ...Well, it was certainly my mistake to say anything about a hero. The weak will die no matter what, disregarding the fact that they may be a hero or not.
 'Heroes' not fit for this war should be eliminated early on."

"Well said. Then will you fight me, Archer?"

"You? This is surprising. I don't know what got on your nerves, but you're challenging your ally to a fight?
 But unfortunately, I am bound by the Command Spell not to fight against you two.
 If you challenge me now, I will only be defeated without resistance just like Rideris it your way of the knight to fight such an opponent, Saber?"
"Hm"

The two glare at each other without a word.
"Stop right there, Archer."
Tohsaka's quiet voice puts a stop to it.
"Hm..."

"This is no time to be fighting with Saber.
 Rider is eliminated, and a Master is gone now. But I'm sure there is one more unidentified Master hiding at our school.
 Our cooperation continues until 'we defeat the Master hiding at our school'. Or what? Do you want me to use another Command Spell to order you not to fight Saber?"

"You're right. Saber was so adherent to her principles that I got too caught up making fun of her.
 I'm sorry, Saber. Please fight me after our cooperation is over."

"...No. It seems I was acting too immature. I will ignore your comment in deference to Rin."
Saber takes a step back while glaring at Archer and stands by my side.

Tohsaka moves Archer back as well.

"...Well, that's about it.
 We're still cooperating. It's impossible to do so today, but we can search for Caster's Master at school tomorrow.
 We'll just be maintaining the present state, but is that all right with you?"

"Yeah. So what will you do now? Are you going to go to the Ryudou Temple?"

"...Of course not. According to Archer, going to the Ryudou Temple is suicidal. If we want to defeat Caster, we'll have to search for her Master first.
 Fortunately or not, Caster's Master is coming to school every day. We should let them be and keep them off guard."

"...Hm?"
I try to think how she came to that conclusion.
Tohsaka knew that there is a Master at our school.
That must be because there's someone there with magical energy other than Shinji.

Since Caster appeared, it must mean the Master at our school is Caster's Master.
Additionally, Caster's Master is coming to school every day for some reason.
It means he or she is coming to school every day defenselessly rather than staying at the Ryudou Temple under Caster's protection.

"...So you're going to figure out who the Master is and attack the Master before they get back to the Ryudou Temple?"
"Yup. It seems like Caster's Master doesn't know that we're Masters.
 If they knew, they wouldn't come to school, right?"

"Ohyeah, that's true. Then Caster's Master didn't know that Shinji was a Master either?"

"...I can't come up with an explanation, but that's likely. But such a stupid thing shouldn't be possible considering how good the Servant is at magic..."

...Yeah.
Even I, who has no knowledge as a Master, got this far thanks to Saber.
If you have a Servant like Caster, I'm sure you wouldn't do something as dangerous as going outside.

"That's wrong. Your premises are wrong, Rin."
"Archer...?"

"I don't think Caster's Master has a free will.
 ...No, I believe the Master thinks he has a free will when in fact, he's controlled by Caster. That woman is not someone who would be under someone. She would first control her Master to do whatever she wishes."

"Are you saying Caster's Master is just a puppet?
 Either by trickery or removing the memory of being a Master?"

"HmI see, it is interesting to think that the Master is not conscious of the state he or she is in.
 Originally, a Servant cannot do something to its Master.
 The Servant cannot exist if it kills its Master.
 In contrast, the Master has the Command Spell. If the Servant disobeys, the Master can even kill the Servant.
 ...With that being the case, it is safer to trick your Master than to kill him."

Tohsaka ponders.
But I'm not convinced.

"Really? Caster's doing a lot of evil deeds, right? Can she actually hide it all from her Master?
 Wouldn't the Master be more on guard the stronger his Servant is?"

"That is not a problem. She can make convenient excuses if her Master is disgustingly good-natured. Caster's Master may be such a person as well."

"Hey. Why did you look at me when you said that?"
"Well, it's because we have a good example here. The possibility that Caster's Master is stupid is not zero."
"I see. You do have a point, Archer."
...Hey.
Why are you agreeing, Saber?

"All right, I get it.
 No matter what kind of a person Caster's Master may be, it's likely that they'll be at school tomorrow.
 We'll continue to investigate the school. And we'll attack Caster's Master as soon as we find him or her."

"...Well, I think that's the appropriate course of action, but how will we look for the Master?"
"That'll be today's homework. We'll each go home and think about it.
 You two are tired anyway, right? I don't want to push you two and have you collapse, so let's call it a day."

"Ehno, I'm not that tired.
 It'll still early, sohey, Tohsaka!?"

"Just do as I say. We can't go into school today, and we don't have a clue right now. It's meaningless to stay here, and most of all... don't you realize Archer's acting strange...!?
 Things won't settle down if he stays with you, considering 'it' only happened yesterday!"

"F-Fine. I'll go home, I'll go home, so..."
Don't whisper to me from such close range...!

"...Then I'll see you tomorrow. I don't think it'll happen again, but be careful during the night. I won't forgive you if Caster gets control of you again."
"Ughall right, all right. I'll go home!"

"......Hmph. And thanks for your work today. You're acting just a bit like a Master now."
Tohsaka jumps away from me.

"Let's go, Archer! I'm going to seriously inquire about your carelessness after we get home!"
"Oh, as I thought. I was thinking how unabusive you were."
"Hey now. Do I really have to settle things with you once and for all?"

Archer and Tohsaka leave arguing.

"We should go home too. I'm a bit tired, so let's have dinner early today."
"That sounds good. I support that idea, Shirou."
We leave the woods quietly so we won't be seen by anyone.

...Yeah.
I'll pull myself together, go shopping in the shopping district, make a big dinner, and take a rest.
We'll talk about Caster and her Master after that.

It's lunchtime, so I go to the student council room.
"Excuse me."
I call out and open the door.
"Oh. You're going to eat lunch here today, Emiya?"
Issei is eating lunch by himself inside.

...Good, this is convenient.

"How is it? How did yesterday's incident turn out?"
I sit down at the table and start talking casually.

"It's still unexplained. They are saying something about there being chemicals in the empty classroom on the first floor. That's the reason they came up with after searching through the school all night."
He must be unhappy, and he starts biting on a tough-looking carrot.

"But you were lucky. You skipped school after lunch and managed to avoid the disaster. Yes, I guess you were rewarded for your good daily conduct."

He now sips on his tea happily.
...Man.
This isn't the right atmosphere to interrogate him, so I'll wait and see for a while.

"Huh!?"
Suddenly, I notice lunch break will be over in five minutes!

"...? What's wrong, Emiya? Did you come up with something?"
"No, but I remembered something. This isn't the time to be leisurely eating lunch."
"?"
I quickly wrap up my lunchbox and turn to Issei.

"...Hm, I have a bad feeling about this. Please do not ask me for money.
 I don't have any even if you want to borrow some."
I get up from my chair.
...I don't have time.
I take a deep breath.
"Issei. Don't ask questions and just take your top off."
I clearly state what needs to be done.

"W-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!!????"
"I told you to take your uniform off. Take your shirt off as well.
 It's not any good unless you're naked."

"W-W-W-W-W-What are you asking for!? Are you insane!? Is it a new way to question me!? No, do I have to do this now!?"
"Yup, this is urgent. Just take off your top. It'll be too late once school ends!"

I attack Issei.
"Whoa! Stop it, you fool! Are you really from a family of warriors!?"

"All right."
To summarize, I didn't find a Command Spell on Issei's body.
I checked thoroughly, but I didn't find anything like a Command Spell.

"Good. This is really good."
I nod to myself.

"What's so good...!? What's with you doing all this for nothing!?"
"? Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, Issei. I can't tell you what's going on, but I needed to check something. It's done with now, so there's no longer any problem."

I bow and apologize.
"Hmo-okay. If you think you have done something bad, it is natural for you to apologize."
Issei goes silent with a serious face.

"......"
But now, the search has gone back to square one.
If Issei, the one at the Ryudou Temple, is innocent, there's nobody else here that might be Caster's Master.

"...Hey, Issei. Is there something strange going on at the temple?"
"Hm? What do you mean by something strange?"
"I don't know. But is there anything that's different?"

"...Let's see. If you mean recently, there is an unfamiliar woman. But that's about it. My father and brother are as always."
Issei says so naturally.


...There's an unfamiliar woman?
Could that be Caster? ...Well, I'm sure she could pretend to be human without a problem.
Or would that be Caster's Master?


...Maybe I should ask Issei about it.
I'll
...I guess I'll ask him about it.
She's not one to reveal herself to the ones living at the temple, but I might be able to get some clues.

"Issei. Can you tell me about this unfamiliar woman?
 Is she from a foreign country, or is her face covered with something like a turban?"

"What is that? We would kick out such a strange person. ...I don't know why you're asking, but she is a legitimate guest.
 ...My brother is happy that she might be an evil woman, but I strangely like her. I have only talked to her once, but she is a good person even if she may look evil."

"Oh, wow. So asking the question was worth it, seeing how you're praising a woman. Did you fall in love with her?"

"D-D-D-D-Don't say such a stupid thing, you fool! I admire a part of her that she doesn't notice herself. First of all, I cannot fall in love with the lover of the one I respect as my older brother, Souichirou"

Issei suddenly stops and lowers his head.
"Ah, "
I don't know if he felt dizzy or what, but Issei falls on the table and does not move.

"...? What's wrong, Issei? Is it anemia or something?"
"No, it's not that I feel bad."

He raises himself real fast.
I laugh thinking that he's acting like a coiled doll.

", Issei?"
I look at Issei without looking at my slashed stomach.

"YOU fell for my trap. The order I implanted into THIS HUMAN functions only when HE meets SOMEONE who INQUIRES about ME."

I hear someone else's voice from Issei's mouth.
When I realize that voice is of the Servant I met at the Ryudou Temple...
"I DO NOT need this DOLL ANYMORE."
...The knife in Issei's hand is stabbed into Issei's neck.


...My mind fades from too much blood loss.
The wound. The wound reaching my organs is not causing my consciousness to fade.

My brain that wants to deny the scene in front of me freezes my consciousness.
Issei falls down before me, not knowing what went on.

...I collapse onto the floor from my knees.
I do not hold my wound, and I blankly stare at my friend who is now a corpse
School's over.
It must be because of what happened yesterday. The students are not allowed to stay at school for any reason.

There's still time until the sun sets.
I'll
"Yeah. I have to go tell Tohsaka that Issei's innocent before she attacks him."
I should hurry.
I'll go get my violent partner before her relationship with Issei becomes a terrible one.

"Huh? Tohsaka-san already went home."
Then...
I'm knocked out after returning to class 2-A after I've searched all over the place.

"Man... She was so ready to do something, but she went home already...?"
...This is getting stupid.
I can contact Tohsaka over the phone after I get home.

I check the student directory as soon as I get home and call Tohsaka.
Ring, ring.
She picks up after dozens of rings and right when I was about to give up.

"This is Tohsaka."
The voice is definitely Tohsaka's.

"Hello, this is Emiya. Do you have time right now?"
"Huh? What are you playing around for, Arhuh? No way, is it for real...!?"
"...Hey now. I don't have enough free time to be playing pranks on you."

"Ohno... Sorry, I was just surprised. So, what's going on? It's surprising for you to call me."

"It's about Issei. We promised this morning to get this cleared up today, right? To tell you the result, Issei wasn't a Master. I'm sure of it since he didn't have a Command Spell."

"Really? ...I'm surprised you really did check it out today. But Issei's innocent, huh? ...Well, we're out of suspects, but I guess that's good as well."
I don't know if she's relieved or disappointed. I can't grasp her reaction too well over the phone.

"Well, thanks for your work. We'll think about what to do about the search tomorrow. So is that all the business you have? Then I'll be hanging up."
"......"
I don't have any more business.
But there's something I'm curious about.

"Tohsaka. You seemed to be surprised earlier, but did something happen over there?"

I can feel Tohsaka's bewilderment over the phone.
After a brief silence...

"...No. I was just surprised because your voice sounded different over the phone."
She answers in a cold voice and hangs up the phone.
"Oh. I think they're having a sale in the shopping district today."
...Hm.
Saber is looking forward to dinner, so it might be good to make an expensive meal today.
I can contact Tohsaka after I get home.

"I just bought some beef fillet."

And veal too. It's just rare, expensive, and doesn't taste that different, but I fell for the butcher's sale talk and bought it...!!!!

"Oh well. It was pretty cheap."
I can consider that I've blown a day's worth of work on it.
Saber looks like she likes meat. We've been having home-cooking all these times, so I'm sure she'll be happy if I make something like a Western-style full course.

"It'd be perfect if I could get an aperitif, but I can't serve alcohol in front of Fuji-Nee.
 Even with the age issue aside, I can't give Fuji-Nee any alco... hol...?"

I see something strange out of the corner of my eye.
"......"
I wonder what it is and turn to the cake shop, Beko-chan.

...Is that some kind of a uniform?
The girl wearing a uniform unfit for this downtown area is troubling the woman at the cake shop.

I get curious and stop.
From what I can hear, it seems the money the girl is trying to pay with is not in Japanese yen, and the woman at the cake shop is stumped as to what she can do.
And on top of that, it seems that the girl can't speak much Japanese.

"......"
......Well, I got a bargain.
I guess I'll do something about it since I happened to walk by.

"Thank you!"
I'm thanked two-fold and leave the cake shop.

"...Thank you. You helped me for cake."
This girl thanks me as well in funny Japanese.
But I haven't done much.
All I did was money exchange, and I just traded the two thousand-yen bills I had with the paper money she had.

"...Change. Left over. You can have it."
"Huh? No, I got enough money already. You gave me two ten-franc bills."

"......"
The girl dressed like Nightingale looks around absent-mindedly.

"...Finished shopping. Goodbye."
 She bows and leaves.
I watch her go thinking to myself about the unusual event.

Then.
"Oh yeah. Do you like cakes?"
I get curious and ask her.

The girl in white stops and stares around absent-mindedly.
"...Yes. Sella likes common tastes."
She gives a vague answer.

I check the student directory as soon as I get home and call Tohsaka.
Ring, ring.
She picks up after dozens of rings and right when I was about to give up.

"This is Tohsaka."
The voice is definitely Tohsaka's.

"Hello, this is Emiya. Do you have time right now?"
"Huh? What are you playing around for, Arhuh? No way, is it for real...!?"
"...Hey now. I don't have enough free time to be playing pranks on you."

"Ohno... Sorry, I was just surprised. So, what's going on? It's surprising for you to call me."

"It's about Issei. We promised this morning to get this cleared up today, right? To tell you the result, Issei wasn't a Master. I'm sure of it since he didn't have a Command Spell."

"Really? ...I'm surprised you really did check it out today. But Issei's innocent, huh? ...Well, we're out of suspects, but I guess that's good as well."
I don't know if she's relieved or disappointed. I can't grasp her reaction too well over the phone.

"Well, thanks for your work. We'll think about what to do about the search tomorrow. So is that all the business you have? Then I'll be hanging up."
"......"
I don't have any more business.
But there's something I'm curious about.

"Tohsaka. You seemed to be surprised earlier, but did something happen over there?"

I can feel Tohsaka's bewilderment over the phone.
After a brief silence...

"...No. I was just surprised because your voice sounded different over the phone."
She answers in a cold voice and hangs up the phone.
I see a dream.

I see a memory that I cannot reach through a small connected circuit.

For what did he fight, and for what did he keep running?
He never told anyone about his motives.
Everyone around him saw him as either obstinate or a weird person.
And on top of it all, he didn't talk much, so I bet he was thought to be ruthless.
His intentions were not known.
At the very least, nobody knew about them.
He never talked about his intentions even after he became a hero and was burdened with many things.

...That's why he appeared suspicious to the people around him.
It's because nobody knows his intention.
He conveniently saves people in danger, but nobody knows why he is doing what he does.

See, it's inevitable that people would feel uneasy about him.
He should have had a reason.
Greed, pride, selfishness, lust, vengeance, or devotion.
Simple reasons like those which are easy to understand. If he'd had any one of them, such an end should not have awaited him.

His reward for success was always betrayal.
The things he picked up sifted through his fingers like grains of sand.
He got used to it.
He got used to it like an idiot.
From the very beginning, his reward was...
...Not what he received from the people he saved, but the pure action of saving someone.

The repetition of it makes me so mad that I want to punch him, and it also makes me want to cry.
The reason he was called a hero...
His intention was never revealed to anyone.
Nobody around him knew, and he, the only one who had to know, eventually forgot about it himself.

That is why I shed tears in spite of myself.
To the miracle, that in the long, long path between the start and the goal, where what is right or wrong is not definite...
...He never strayed from his original goal.

And the end comes.
An excellent savior is only trouble for everyone except the ones he saves.
He knew his limits and the vastness of the world.
He accepts what can be saved and what cannot be saved.
That is why he at least wanted people within his sight to be happy.
Many scorned it as hypocrisy and as blind idealism.
There were more enemies than allies, and he died at their hands.

...So this is not a place in this world.

This place is the end of him.
The illusion that he saw on the verge of his death, the only pride he had within himself.
The hero that used this scenery as his weapon falls into his own darkness in the end.

The hill of swords that he reached...
His battle ends atop this hill, surrounded by rusted steel without a wielder.
He is still alone.
But he thinks there is nothing to regret if he was able to save everyone that appeared within his sight...
And he smiles in satisfaction, lets go of the sword, and crumples down.

...That's why he never had any regrets.
His objective was already accomplished long ago.
From the start, he ran with his utmost effort, not for himself, but for strangers who shouldn't have meant anything to him

No, it'll be dangerous to talk about this.
Issei's living at the Ryudou Temple.
If he gets suspicious of this 'strange woman', Issei might get curious and do something.
Andif that woman happens to be a Master, Issei would be in danger.


This is it for today.
I'll call it good since I found out Issei's unrelated to the Holy Grail War.

"Oh, by the way, Emiya. Shinji's sister wasn't at school today."
"...Huh? Sakura's not at school?"

"Shinji was absent as well. They were both absent without notice today, so the teachers are wondering if something happened at their house or not."

I'm at a loss for words, being confronted with a problem I'd forgotten.

"Oh, lunch break is over. Let's go back to the classroom."
Issei pushes me out of the student council room.
...All the while...
Thoughts of Sakura's absence and what Shinji may have done after losing Rider twirl around in my head.
Yay, Gai**x bomb!
Kyaa, Ragnarok!
Well, it only takes a second to be careful, but the injury could last a lifetime. How was this dead end that teaches you it's not good to ask just anyone?
Osu! It was such an irrational and sudden death! This is exactly what I expect from "Fate", and it is surely splendid!
Yes. But we cannot forget about the sacrifices!
Let us give Ryudou-kun a three-second silent prayer!
Osu! The three second part is great, master!
So, Ilya-chan. What is going on with the people at the Ryudou Temple?
Hmm. They have this artificial Command Spell put in them.
They become this thing that executes this one command when they find someone that breaks one of the "three rules" Caster established.
She's good at making things. If she ever captures Shirou, I bet she'll turn him into a formal tool just to support her magic.
Evil! I acknowledge Caster as evil!
As a teacher, I cannot forgive anyone that would use others as they wish!
...I don't know about calling her evil just because of that.
It's true that Caster is weak, sly, and cowardly, but she's not truly bad on the inside.
Hm? Why are you sticking up for such a witch...?
Do you have something in mind?
Huh...? N-No.
I just want to say it's not bad to bind someone with magic.
Oh, I remember. You've done worse to Shirou!
Damn, you found out!
Ouu... I can't beat that shinai for some reason.
It's only natural. No magic is allowed in this dojo.
You have to bring in a wild lion or a modern weapon to beat me.
Have you repented of your actions?
...Yes.
I won't do anything bad again.
Yes, that's a good girl! The boy's wish is granted as well! Rejoice, Shirou, Ilya is nicer in this route!
Fine, fine. So I just have to stay quiet in this route, right?
...Well, it's not smart always to be going on a rampage. I can help Shirou in this route and take one of the other heroines.
Whatyou have put that much thought into this?
Loli-buruma isn't good enough, so you're taking on such a great role in the main storyline...!?
Ilya... she's a scary child...!

It's seven o'clock.
Tohsaka comes right on time.

"Sorry to keep you waiting. I took time since I was getting the necessary things.
 How's your preparation?"

I show her the wooden sword bag.
There's one wooden sword in here.
This is about all the preparation I can do.

"...Well, I guess it can't be helped. First of all, we have Saber for hand-to-hand combat. It might be that you'll just end up watching."

"Yeah. I guess I'll just back Saber up since she's here."
...Well, I can't think of a situation where I'll be helping out Saber.

"Rin. Why is Archer not here?"
Then.
Saber asks with a serious expression.

"Huh...? You didn't bring Archer, Tohsaka?"
"No, I left him at home. We're doing a surprise attack today, so we won't need him if we have Saber, right? To be honest, I don't want to let him see Caster."

Tohsaka starts walking.
...I don't know what she's thinking, but I guess we won't be getting Archer's help.

...Time passes.
One has to pass this intersection if one is to go from the school to the Ryudou Temple.

It's already been an hour since we got here.
A boundary field has been created here
"It's over if we're seen, but the soundproofing is perfect.
 Nobody would notice even if a missile is shot here."
According to Tohsaka.

It's so quiet around us.
I guess it's because Tohsaka's boundary field is working, but the town is too lifeless.
It's already been seven days since the Holy Grail War started.
It seems the town is having its spirit slowly drained without anyone noticing.

"He's coming. Hide, Emiya-kun."
"!"
I move to the wall.
...I can't even hear footsteps.
I see a shadow under the streetlight.

A tall and lean figure...
The familiar figure is definitely that of Kuzuki Souichirou.
Kuzuki passes us with his usual ordered steps.


He's too defenseless.
I'm suddenly attacked by the feeling that Kuzuki-Sensei might be innocent.

"...Hey, Tohsaka. Don't you think Kuzuki-Sensei is innocent?"
"......Well, we'll find out for sure after we try."
It seems Tohsaka is in doubt as well.
I guess she's still going with the plan, as she points her index finger at Kuzuki.

Gandr.
It is a "curse" to reduce the target's physical ability, considered to be the simplest magic.
Tohsaka's Gandr shot is more like a gunshot, but I'm sure she'll go easy this time.

"Are you ready, Emiya-kun?"
She murmurs.


I'll still make it.
There is a possibility that Kuzuki Souichirou is innocent.
Isn't there another way to check if he's a Master or not?
We can't do this.
This method is too violent...!

"Hold on, Tohsaka...! This is too reckless...!"
"It's too late! I can't quit now!"
"!"

Tohsaka sticks out her left hand.
A black shot is released with an ear-ringing sound.

...I bite my lips to bear the uneasiness.
I'll have to bear it.
If Kuzuki-Sensei turns out to be innocent, I'll just have to remove the "curse" on him with all my power.

"I'm shooting now!"
She takes a small breath.
And right after that, a black bullet is released.

Everyone watches it in astonishment.
Not just me and Tohsaka.
Even Caster, who should be overwhelmed with victory, watches her master in astonishment.

Saber's quick charge to Kuzuki's counter-attacks...
From the nightmare-like neck grab, to the perfect throw that fascinated even us.


Saber doesn't move.
She was thrown by her neck and smashed back first into the wall.
The wound on her neck should be fatal.
Even worse, she hit the wall with such speed.

I don't think it killed her, but I'm sure she won't be able to move.
At the very least, Saber will stay on the ground until the wounds on her neck and body heal.

"No... way..."
I murmur without realizing.
Even though his fists are strengthened using Caster's magic, Kuzuki is only human.
Who could possibly think that he would be able to overwhelm a Servant in hand-to-hand combat?

"It is fine to assume that the Master's role is to support the battle from the back."
The lean figure turns.
"But there are always exceptions. There are Masters who can only fight head on."

He just proved that to us.
So...
Their roles as the one to fight and one to support are reversed...!

"What are you doing, Caster? I told you earlier.
 If you are to support me, you are to eliminate the enemy's projectile weapons."

The enemyKuzuki stares at Tohsaka.
A threat to him would not be Saber, but Tohsaka, who is able to attack from a distance.
That's why he won't attack us.
He fully knows that letting a magus fight a magus would be the most sure way to a kill.

"What's wrong, Caster? I told you that you can do as you wish."
"No, I will take care of Saber. Souichirou, please take care of the Masters."


Kuzuki silently nods and walks toward us.
Caster faces Saber behind him.

"Fine. Saber was taken aback, but I already know his attacks. We just have to beat him before he gets close to us."

Tohsaka slowly retreats while glaring at Kuzuki.
A battle between a magus and a fighter is a fight for distance.
Even though Kuzuki has monstrous fighting techniques, he has no magic resistance.

Therefore, we can win if we cast something.
We win if we manage to cast a spell before he reaches us.


Kuzuki faces Tohsaka and does not move.
Caster is walking towards the wall where Saber is smashed.

...That action is a mistake.
That's an opening I can take advantage of, so now
I'll protect Saber.
Even though she might not be able to defeat him, Tohsaka should have the advantage if she concentrates on running away.
There's about five meters between us.
If Kuzuki takes another step, Tohsaka should react instantly to avoid Kuzuki's attack.

But Saber's different.
Her neck is half cut off, and she was smashed back first into a wall.
Saber is in a terrible situation right now.
Even if she may be invincible against magi, Caster could easily defeat her in that state...!

"I'm counting on you, Tohsaka!"
I ready my wooden sword and charge at Kuzuki.

My objective is to reach Saber, who is about to be attacked by Caster.
I swing my wooden sword at Kuzuki as I pass him.
I'm sure he'll avoid it, but Tohsaka should take advantage of the opening I create...!

I swing my sword.

"Guh, kuh!?"
It doesn't even do anything.
The wooden sword is easily destroyed, he blows off my left foot with the returning blow, and...
...He rushes in at Tohsaka in an instant.

Time stops.
Tohsaka's astonished, but she instantly points her hand at Kuzuki.

But the right hand that almost pierced Saber's neck...
...Is thrust at her chest.

"Ahguh......!"
Tohsaka's breath is stopped at the impact.
Then...
A hammer-like fist strikes her head mercilessly.

"Tohsaka."
...I take in my fate seeing her miserable figure.
...Her head is missing.
Anything above her neck doesn't exist anymore.

"You made a wrong decision like Caster did, Emiya."
"......"
I can't raise my head.
...I can't look at Kuzuki. I am just like a student who's unable to answer his question in a classroom.
I stand on one foot like a scarecrow.

"This is the second human being I have killed..."
 A footstep.
 A killer called Kuzuki Souichirou slowly makes his way towards me.
"...But I still do not feel anything."
Smack.
With a ridiculous sound, a hole is created in my chest.
I'll protect Tohsaka.
Saber isn't dead yet.
Even though Kuzuki was an unexpected monster, Saber hasn't lost yet.
And besides, Caster shouldn't be able to finish Saber off.


I put strength into my grip.
I glare at Kuzuki, so as not to miss even his blinking.
The instant he faces Tohsaka, I slide myself in between them.
Knowing Tohsaka, I bet she'll jump instantly to the side to shoot Kuzuki

"Kya...!"
There's no time to do so.
It happens in an instant.
The instant I think Kuzuki's body wavered, he is in front of Tohsaka.

She's astonished, but Tohsaka instantly points her hand at Kuzuki.
But the right hand that almost pierced Saber's neck...
...Strikes Tohsaka right in her chest.

"Ahguh......!"
Time stops for Tohsaka.
She's hit right in the center of her body and has her breath stopped.

That's it.
As she cannot breathe, she cannot cast her spell and has most of her ability as a magus cut off.
She managed to instantly jump back, so the attack only stopped her breath.

But the next attack...
Even though she jumped back, it's only about a meter or so.
Such a distance...
It's not even considered a retreat against Kuzuki!

"Kuh!"
I move in between them.
Using my wooden sword as a shield, I face Kuzuki, who's about to attack Tohsaka.
He thrusts his fist.

"Wha...!?"
I can't see it...!?
How did Saber avoid such a
", guh!"
I desperately protect my left side.

I hear a heavy sound and the sound of my wooden sword breaking.
I see Kuzuki getting ready for his next attack.

I'll die.
I feel it instinctively.
My strengthened wooden sword was like metal.
If he can destroy it in one blow, he can destroy any part of my body.

I can't stop him.
Tohsaka is coughing painfully behind me.
I can't see his attacks, and my only weapon was destroyed.

His fist accurately goes for my temple.
Emiya Shirou will die from that hammer-like attack.
Having my head smashed off, I would probably splatter a rain of blood and brains.

I'll die if I don't stop it.
A weapon.
I can't match him.
I'll need a strong weapon to make up for the vast difference in our powers.

It closes in on my brain.
I imagine myself dying.
No. If that happens...

I'll die if I can't stop it.
A weapon. I need a weapon.
A weapon that he can't destroy. Not a quickly-furnished weapon like a wooden sword, but a proven, strong weapon.
The finest quality at that, a weapon undeserved by me. Yes, the weapon he carries would probably be

"Trace, on."
Then I'll make it. I'll make it even if it's impossible. I'll make it no matter what the consequences may be.
I make myself believe that strengthening and reproduction, things that already exist and things that do not already exist, are similar.

That's right, there's no time to think. Fake it no matter what.
It does not matter if something gets destroyed in the process. I don't care even if it's just a fake. Hurry. Forget everything. Don't I know that I'm not the only one who'll be killed!? If I can't stop it, Tohsaka will......!!!!!!!"

"Huh, no way...!?"
That spectacle...
Tohsaka speaks out for me.
"Hm"
A deep voice.
Is that Kuzuki's voice?
Something might have happened to my ears as I can't hear properly.

No, not only my ears, but the senses of my limbs are too weak.
Only my right eye is functioning.
I watch the approaching fist.
I observe as someone else's action blocks the attack.


My arms are about to rip off.
Even though I have no feeling, I hear my nerves tearing off.

In my hands are his twin swords.
Yang-sword Kanshou and Yin-sword Bakuya.
The names of the swords.
Even though they're haphazardly reproduced, the swords still present their existences to the wielder.

But I'm sorry.
I can't project you guys perfectly with my skills.

"Guh!"


We spring apart.
The twin swords that parried thirty attacks break as if saying they cannot take any more.
It's not because they lost against Kuzuki's fists.
The swords disappeared because I couldn't maintain their image.


The twin swords must have been unexpected, as Kuzuki shows hesitation for the first time.
Then...
A strong wind is created in the intersection.

"Saber...!"
I look toward the wall.
Saber must have healed as she is standing up.
Caster is backing away from her.

...Yes, that's why it was a mistake.
Even though she was defeated, Saber still had her powers. So there's no way Saber, who has powerful magic resistance, could be cornered by Caster.
It is Kuzuki's role to finish Saber off.
But Caster made a mistake.
She must have been planning something, but that extra thinking caused her to lose out on her perfect chance.


Kuzuki retreats.
He stands as if to protect Caster and...
"This is it. We'll retreat, Caster."
He makes a precise decision.

"Master...!? No, Saber is hurt. You should be able to defeat her again!"
"She is not someone who would fall for it twice. It is I who underestimated her.
 I should have attacked her one more time."

...Kuzuki is right.
Saber was cornered because Kuzuki's techniques were too odd.
But that's only up to now.
I can't cope with it no matter how many times I receive them, but Saber is already used to the attacks.

The main point of a tactic is not to have a concrete shape.
Even though they are strong, Kuzuki's attacks are too odd, so they are easily seen through.
Therefore, they must be fatal on the first strike.
That is the difference between a "technique" that is trained to an art, and an "action" that is trained to the utmost limits.

"...I understand, Souichirou.
 Yes, a Servant should obey its Master."
Who was that directed at?
Caster's robe flutters as she finishes.

...There's nothing after that.
The bluish-purple robe circles Kuzuki, and as if through sorcery, they disappear without a trace.
And I see his dream.

The memory of the man who was set up as a hero...
A story of a knight who was understood by no one.

It was a simple story.
In short, there was something wrong with him.
He had some power, and he had some ambition.
But he used his powers at the wrong places from beginning to end, and he died.

It's only natural.
Power exists to grant your own wishes.
Compassion does no good for others.
Kirei says so often, but everything is balanced because everything you do comes back to you.
One gets energy because actions circle around to create more energy.

But not having that means never being replenished.
For example, if one lives for others and not oneself, I'm sure one would run out of power right away.
If there were such a thing as disposable money, that's what it would be like.
It'd be used by strangers, and it'd only disappear after it's used.
It's easy to take advantage of it, and that it'd be used is already a given.
That's why in the end...
He saw many betrayals, and his life was ended by "someone" he saved.

...It just makes me mad.
I want to question him, "why?"
He worked hard, put in great effort even though he's an ordinary human being, and he managed a miracle with his own blood.
And his compensation was betrayal and death. It's not even a joke, but he died satisfied.
I have no intention of commenting on someone's life, but...
I can never accept that one thing.

That's my impression of the dream I've seen a few times now.
I usually wake up here.
But...
It seems the dream continues today.

He is standing in hell.

It is a scene of some natural disaster, not the result of human conflict.

"Let me make a contract. I shall give you my life after my death. I would like the compensation now."

He weaves the words of contract.
After that, he changed as though possessed by something and saved people who could not normally be saved.
...Oh, so this must be how he became a "heroic spirit".

...Seeing it this way, it's nothing much.
I bet the people he saved were not even in the hundreds.
He cannot even be called a "hero" with such a number, nor would he be promoted to a "heroic spirit".
But the number isn't important.
The qualification of a hero, one who surpasses humans, is to be able to save those that are fated to die.

It is an alteration of fate.
It does not matter if he does not have power as a hero, as long as he averted a disaster that could not be changed, however small in scope.
No.
The world would obtain a "heroic spirit" in compensation for the miracle.

He became a hero and saved those that could not have been saved.
As a result, he became a heroic spirit after he died, and he is now repeating what he was doing before he died
Being a "servant".
I guess compensation for a miracle is to become a convenient disposable tool that will fight for others even after one dies.

Heroic spirits.
Superior spirits chosen from amongst humans. The guardians of humanity.
But they are not ones with free will like the Servants.
Heroic spirits are guardians of humanity.
Guardians do not have a free will, and they are treated as "powers".
They are called forth to protect the world only when a factor appears that could destroy it. They are weapons that destroy these factors.
The Servant system is a summoning ritual that takes advantage of these "guardians".

The guardians are summoned into every age, eliminate the offending factor, and then disappear from this world.
...I would hate to be like that, but he must have been prepared to take on that role.

No, he might have even wished for it...
That it would be perfect if he could save people even after he died.
Even though he did not have the power to save them when he was alive, he must have believed he could avert every tragedy if he became a heroic spirit.
With that in mind, he made a contract with the world to give up his body after his death, and he saved a hundred people.
...Believing that...
...He would be able to save tens of thousands of people afterwards.

How... stupid of him.
That cannot be.
Because for a heroic spirit to be called upon, the place would already have to be a place of death.
Heroic spirits are summoned only into hell.
They appear only when the world is about to be destroyed by people.
Humans are the ones that will perish from their own doings.
So the process of destruction must always be the same.

Jealousy. Hatred. Selfishness. Desire.
The man who loved people and tried to be of help to them was shown the same ugliness even after he died.
He was called into such scenes and served his responsibility as a guardian.

He killed.
He killed and killed and killed and killed. He killed everyone that was around him when he was summoned to save humanity as a whole.
I don't know how many times he repeated thatnor do I know how many times he will have to repeat it in the future.

...So there's only one thing I can say.
He has been betrayed by many things...
But in the end, he was betrayed by the only thing he believed in, his ideal.

"Geez"
When I wake up, that's all I can say.
My body feels tired and I can't move at all.
My mind is the only clear thing, and I blankly stare at the ceiling.

"...I knew it. So that's his memory, huh?"
I sigh and stare at the ceiling.
...This is hard.
He could have told me that I might get a glimpse of his memory when I'm asleep because Masters and Servants are connected.
If he had told me, I could have cut my consciousness so that I wouldn't see such a thing.

"I'll get up. There are lots of things I have to do today."
I get up.
My body is heavy and my eyelids are heavier than steel.
I curse how I'm not a morning person and start changing into my uniform slowly.

"But, well..."
I don't know if this is as I expected or not.
But he used to be a hot-blooded man.
I don't know what hero he is, but it seems he was more honest before.

"...Well, I guess it's natural to have a twisted personality if he led such a life and ended up like he has, even after he died."
I laugh it off.
My face in the mirror looks serious and about to cry, but I decide to laugh.
Because I have to do so or I won't be able to face Archer normally.

I get ready and drink the freshly brewed tea in the living room.
I don't usually eat breakfast, so it's pretty quick.
I have fifteen minutes until I have to get going. This cup of tea is like a ritual I perform every morning to wake up my half-asleep body.
"Rin, how long are you going to be playing around for?"
But there's one fool that cannot read his master's mind.

"I'm going to relax until seven-thirty. I'll be late if I stay here longer than that."
"I'm not talking about school. I'm talking about the Holy Grail War.
 ...It is not bad to cooperate with other Masters. But in your case, the partner you chose is too weak."
"Geez."
That again?
Archer tells me to cut my ties with Emiya Shirou every chance he gets.

"I told you I have no intention of doing so. You say so, but I think he's rather suitable. It's true that he's not much help in battle, but he's perfect as an ally.
 ...Um, I think he would never betray me."

"Trust is usually established through tactics. I cannot trust someone without a reason. Look, he is not someone that will stay and win. If you are to choose an ally, Caster's Master is a smarter person."
"Don't kid me, Archer. Are you telling me to stoop so low?"
I put my teacup down and stare at Archer.
Even if it may be sarcasm, I cannot ignore what he just said.



...The air freezes.
I'm seriously pissed, and Archer has no intention of backing down.
We stare at each other for a while.

"It is true that Caster is a heretic, but she is indeed like a magus.
 In that regard, you are not fit for fighting. If you are a magus, you should put results over your wishes."
"It's useless being cynical. I won't change my policy."
"...Man, what is wrong with you? You've gotten strange since you got to know Emiya Shirou. Where did that rationality of yours go?"


...Heh.
I realize that without having you tell me.
But I can't help it.
He doesn't have anything even though he's a magus, and is dangerously single-minded.
It's unproductive to scheme against such a guy, andhe's, um...

"Rin? What's wrong? Did you finally realize your own foolishness?"
"Yeah, there is something wrong with me.
 But Archer. This is all because you showed me unnecessary things."
"What?"

"...No, forget about it. You're my Servant, so I'm only going to do what I believe is right. I'm not as loose as Emiya Shirou, but I do have some things I can't give up. I won't give them up no matter who's telling me so."

I say so with anger.
And that makes me realize...
I don't feel any sympathy, even after learning about his past.
I'm just mad at him.

"...Humph. Where's your reply, Archer!?"
I take it out on Archer and glare at him.
The knight in red makes his usual gesture.
"I guess it can't be helped. It is the role of the servant to support his master when the master is not doing well. I shall look after you until you return to your usual self."
And he answers with a reply that's neither a 'yes' nor a 'no'.

...I wake up.
I feel heavy, like there's lead inside my head.

"What is this? I haven't been waking up very well recently."
Is it because I have lots to think about or because I'm seeing strange dreams?
"!"
Even though I usually don't see dreams, I think I've been seeing something like a dream recently.

"...Well, they were beautiful swords..."
I see images of swords in my dreams.
In them, his shortswords come up pretty often.

"Damn. Yeah, I like them. So what?"
I curse the person that's not here and get up from my futon.
It's before six in the morning.
I can't be affected by strange dreams. I have to go make breakfast.

Saber sees me off as I leave the house.
I'm getting used to this lifestyle, as the morning passes by smoothly.

I don't see Tohsaka at the gate.
Since the only suspect we had, Issei, turned out to be innocent, I bet she's busy running around gathering information.

"Wait, it's not someone else's business. I have to investigate as well."
...But how will I do that?
I guess Tohsaka is investigating the people at school, so I guess I'll investigate the building.

Well, life's not convenient enough to let me notice anything I haven't noticed before.
I searched the school using all the breaks I had and the first half of lunch break, but I wasn't able to find anything strange.

"Hm. I don't know what you were up to, but good job on your work."
He must be done eating already, as he greets me while reading an old poetry book.

"......Thanks. I'm getting some tea since I'll be eating here. Oh, where's the teapot?"
"Oh, it's here. We only have kelp tea, but is that all right?"

"What? Hmm, then I'll just take water. I just can't take the muddled feeling of that tea."
"I see. Then I shall go get some green tea from the teacher's office tomorrow."
I leave the laughing Issei to himself, pour some water into my cup, and sit down at the table.

"Itadakimasu."
I clap my hands together and open my lunchbox.
At the same time, someone knocks on the door.
"Huh? There's someone at the door, Issei."
"Hm? At this time?"
Issei slowly goes to the door.

The visitor is Kuzuki, the one in charge of the student council.
I see Kuzuki-Sensei a lot here, but I bet it's "Emiya is in the student council room a lot" from his point of view.


I silently eat my chicken-sprinkled lunch.
There must not be anything important today, as Issei and Kuzuki-Sensei are just chatting.


Munch.
Munch, munch.

"Sensei, it's almost time."
"Hm. I see. Sorry to take your time. I think you know without having it said, but do not forget to lock this place up. And make sure you leave school on time."
"Yes, yes. I know."
Kuzuki-Sensei leaves and Issei comes back in a good mood.


...Wow, I just saw something rare.
It's really rare to see Kuzuki-Sensei chatting about meaningless things with a student.
And with that shy Issei.
...Oh. They might get along since they're both stubborn, but it's still strange.

"Hey, Issei."
"Hm? What, Emiya?"
"I've been wondering for a while, but are you on good terms with Kuzuki?"
Oh, he's surprised.

"No, it's fine if you don't want to answer. I just thought that was the case, so don't worry about it."
"Oh, no. I just realized I haven't told you about it. It is only natural that we are getting along. Kuzuki-Sensei is like a brother to me."
"Huh?"
Kuzuki-Sensei is like Issei's brother?

"Hold on. What does that mean?"
"I'm telling you that he's like my older brother.
 SouichirouKuzuki-Sensei has been staying over at my place for about three years. He is a naive person as you can see, but he has a sincere heart. He is living under the same roof as me, and he is someone I can respect as a person. It is only natural for me to respect him as my older brother."

"Kuzuki lives at the Ryudou Temple?"
It feels like I got hit in the head with a hammer.
But I act calm and ask Issei to continue.

"Oh yeah. You mentioned something about an unfamiliar woman at your place, right? Does Kuzuki know about her?"
"She is more than that, as she is his fiancee. We are letting her borrow a room until they hold their wedding celebration."


A second shock.
"Issei. You wouldn't call her an unfamiliar woman in that case, right?"
I try my hardest to object with a dizzy head.

"An unfamiliar woman is an unfamiliar woman. Even if she may be Kuzuki-Sensei's fiancee, that is all I can say about her, as I don't even know her name."
Issei stops the conversation as if saying he's angry.


...A-Anyways.
This is something I can't ignore.
Kuzuki Souichirou is coming from the Ryudou Temple, and there is a woman that is said to be at the Ryudou Temple.
I hear Kuzuki-Sensei's fiancee showed up about a month ago.
If that's Caster, all our answers are right there

"So, that's what I heard."

In the classroom after school...
We don't even have ten more minutes until we have to go home, but I tell Tohsaka about Kuzuki-Sensei.

"What do you think? Considering Issei's case, I don't think we should suspect him just because he's from the Ryudou Temple."

"...Kuzuki-Sensei, huh? He's not even a magus to start with, disregarding the fact that he doesn't have the presence of a Master."
I don't know if she's listening to me, as Tohsaka is frowning to herself.

"He's not a magus...? That's good. I guess we can count him out in that case."
"Why? Someone as suspicious as him has to be a Master."

...Well, I'm starting to get used to this.
But I still can't keep up with Tohsaka's thought processes.

"We'll ambush him tonight. I'll try pulling some strings so that he'll have to stay the nightshift, so you be ready too."

"Heyhold on. We can't do that.
 Get him on night shift... Are you saying we'll fight him tonight?"
"Of course. There's no guarantee that Kuzuki will come to school tomorrow.
 We won't wait. We'll make him stay at school until night and test if he's a Master or not on his way home."

"...Let me ask you to make sure. How are you going to test if he's a Master or not?"
"Using force. Just like I did to you."

The phrase "just like I did to you" sounds a bit sweet.
...So, as I thought, Tohsaka is a bully inside.
Maybe I fought her over the playground's peace when we were small.

"I'm against it. There should be a gentler way to check. We shouldn't have to take such dangerous measures."
"It's not dangerous. I'm not indiscriminate, you know?
 I'll just shoot a light Gandr shot at him. If he's a normal person, he'll just sleep in for two days with a cold."

"Ohthat's a problem as well. If Kuzuki is a Master, we'll get into a battle right then and there. As we're the ones attacking him, we won't be able to talk to him."

"...? I don't get it. That'll be even more convenient.
 What part of it do you think is dangerous?"

"I'm the one that doesn't get you! I'm talking about how dangerous it'll be for you."

Tohsaka must have finally realized, as she stops the conversation.

But that's only for an instant.
"I see. That's fine as well. I'll just do it by myself in that case."
She easily concludes.

"Damn!"
I guess it's meaningless to say anything to her once she's determined to do something.

"...All right, I'll go along. I don't know what reckless things you might do if I let you be."
"That's my line. ...Geez."

"...It's time to leave. Then we'll meet at seven at the park below the bridge. We'll probably end up fighting, so you better be prepared."
She looks away and walks off.
I leave the classroom after her.

"Then we will attack Caster's Master tonight?"
"We still don't know if Kuzuki is a Master, but that's pretty much the plan."

I report to Saber about today as soon as I get home.
Saber must agree with Tohsaka, as she is hyped up already.

"So we won't be training today. I'll go make dinner right away, so let's get ready for tonight... Wait, is it bad to eat before going to battle?"

"Huh...? Why are you asking? I believe there will be a problem if we get hungry during battle"
"Well, I was thinking that it might be too heavy. We don't even have an hour left, so we might be better off eating after we come home."

"Oh, I do not think that is the case. It is a quality of warriors to quickly digest anything we consume.
 I do not think food will be bad if one has been training and has led a proper lifestyle..."

"Um. Does that mean I can cook dinner?"
"Yes. I believe we will have more energy that way."
...I see.
I have trained to be able to move right after meals, so I guess there's no problem.
But I'll make a light dinner just in case.

"Then I'll be going to the living room. How about you, Saber?"
"I cannot bother you. I will stay here and calm my mind."
I guess she'll be sitting here Japanese-style in meditation.

"All right. I'll come get you once dinner's ready."
I leave the dojo.
It's dark outside.
We're meeting at seven. ...That must mean we'll be attacking Kuzuki-Sensei about an hour after we meet.


We'll have to fight if Kuzuki turns out to be a Master.
Caster is a wary Servant.
She would never give us another chance at a surprise attack if she found out her Master had been attacked.
...Then we'll have to make sure to beat him if we're going to attack.
I can't let my enemy escape, nor can I run away.

No matter who it may be, Caster's Master has to be defeated to stop Caster, the one attacking all the people in this town.
If all goes well, we'll take away his Command Spell and he won't be a Master anymore.
...But in the worst case, we'll have to try to kill each other.

"Oh yeah. I have to take a weapon.
 A weapon at my placesomething I can easily put magical energy intowould be a wooden sword.
My success rate of the "strengthening" magic has been pretty good recently, so even a wooden sword would become a good weapon.
But that's only in the case of normal battles.
I'll need a better weapon if I am to fight against a Master or a Servant.

"To be greedyswords like his."
...I imagine what I saw in my dream.

Twin swords of black and white.
If they're about that long, I should be able to use them...
...And most of allI could fight decently if I had those swords.
I'd be able to protect myself, not be a burden on Saber, and be proud that I'm Saber's Master.

"Man. It's meaningless to ask for something you don't have, you idiot."

My shoulders slump as I head to the porch.
I'll just do what I can.
For now, I'll concentrate on making dinner.
Saber always seems so serious, but it seems Saber is looking forward to the meals. It's been my recent secret joy to make her happy.
There's no one at the house.
The hallway's dead silent.
My ears might still be screwed up, as I can't even hear my own footsteps.
The numbness in my limbs won't go away, and I don't feel like I'm stepping on the ground.


Surprised that I can still walk in this condition, I go with Saber to my room.

"Let's not train today. You must be tired, right?
 You were pretty badly wounded too."
I talk to Saber once we get to my room.

"...No, I do not have a problem. I have used magical energy to heal myself, but I am still able to replenish that magical energy.
 More than that, Shirou. Is there anything wrong with your body?"

"...? No, I'm fine. My limbs are still heavy, but this is like muscular pain, so I bet it'll be gone by tomorrow."

"......All right. But please tell me if your body is hurting."

"Yeah. You can wake me up too if anything happens. If you get hungry at night, I'll make you something."
 I can't provide magical energy for her, so all I can do is make some food to cheer her up.

"...Shirou. Please do not push yourself."
Saber goes to the next room.

"......Yeah. I guess I'll go to bed."
I set my futon down and lay on it.
My limbs are a bit numb.
It might be the effect of magic I'm not used to doing, as I feel like I'll pass out if I let my guard down.

"...Hm. ...What's going on?"
I guess... I'm tired.
The ringing in my ears annoys me, but I think I can still get a good night's sleep

"! Ah......"

"Ah, gu, guh"

"HaaHaa, ha, gi"

"Ahguh......!!!!!"
I squeeze the futon.
It feels like hot metal is coming up my throat.
Every muscle, every bone in my body is messed up.

"Giah, guh!"
I hear a grinding sound with my numb ears.
The sound of creaking bones is coming from within me.
What don't they like?
My bones are twitching as if to complain to me, and my ribs are shaking as if to burst out of my body.

"Guhhaa......!"
Pain runs throughout my body.
My whole body is pushed down by a great force, but the pain is coming from within.
It's condensed in a small place, but the contradiction is that my body is expanding.

"Gah......!!!!"
On top of my futon, I wiggle around like a bug and try to bear the unknown pain.

"Haaah, ah"
...My brain's burning.
My brain must not be able to endure the pain, as it is like a sauna now.
I don't care if this is compensation for magic over my level, or if this is the abnormality Saber was talking about.

"Guhah........."
But for some reason, I don't want to ask Saber for help.
I don't want to worry her, and I have to be responsible for what I did.
"...It's natural... to do so...... since I'm a guy"
I suppress my moaning as I sweat.

...The clock I look at with my vague mind says it's not yet midnight.
I should be able to escape this pain if I sleep, but I'm sure the pain will wake me up even if I do.

"HaHaagu......!!!"
...I'm going into a daze.
My mind's boiling up.
The pain should go away once the sun comes up.
But until then...
I have to bear this pain for about seven hours, and this fact by itself seems like a bad dream

She must have made a sound on purpose.
It is slow, and the black haze goes for Kuzuki like a pitcher's changeup.


A wind of disease that will cause him to be sick in bed for two days.
But two days of inaction is fatal for a Master.
There has to be some kind of a reaction if Kuzuki-Sensei is a Master.

"Crap!"
Tohsaka jumps.
...Kuzuki does not react at all. Tohsaka's Gandr shot mercilessly hits Kuzuki Souichirou's head
But, right before that.
It is nullified by a robe that suddenly appears in the sky.

"Oh."
The man that was supposed to get hit by the Gandr shot looks at us.
...As if saying he knew we were here all along.

"Tohsaka...!"
I quickly take the wooden sword out of my bag and put magical energy into it.
There's no time to be screwing up the "strengthening" magic.

The robe that appeared in front of Kuzuki now takes form.
Female limbs appear from the bluish purple robe.
Teleportation.
A complete teleportation is considered to be a sorcery even in this modern world.
Caster has easily performed such a thing to appear in front of us.

"I have warned you, Souichirou. I told you to stay at the Ryudou Temple because such things can happen."
She must think nothing of us, as she calmly talks to her masterKuzuki.
"That is not true. We did catch a target."

"Yes. The fish aren't that large, but it makes no difference since this is quite a haul. Come out now, you foolish magus."


I guess running away would be hard now.
No, if Caster and her Master are here, all we have to do is fight them, even if this is in the middle of the town.
But before that

"You're not coming out? That's too bad. I at least wanted to see what you looked like."
"Damn that fox. She should know who we are already"

Tohsaka grumbles from her hiding spot.
Caster must hear it...
"I will give you three seconds. I will do the same attack to you after that."
...Since she says so and points her hand in our direction.

I recall what happened at the Ryudou Temple.
She won't hold back.
Knowing her, I bet she would destroy this whole area along with the wall we're hiding behind.

"Emiya-kun, jump out when I give the signal. Saber, are you ready?"
I sense her nodding behind me.
But.
There's something I need to confirm before that.

"Sorry. Do that later, Tohsaka."
"Huh?"
I don't wait for her reply.
I go out into the intersection with my wooden sword.

"Hey, Shirou!"
...Tohsaka must not want to let me go alone, as she comes out as well.

"Oh, this is unexpected. Do you understand your position more now, boy?"
Caster watches us with composure.
...Kuzuki is standing next to her.
We're about ten meters apart.
No matter how I think about it, Caster's finger would be much faster than me running into them.


But I showed myself in spite of that.
I have to do something before I fight.
That is

"Tohsaka and Emiya, huh? So you two are Masters as well, like Matou? Fate has an odd way of doing things."
...To check the true identity of Kuzuki Souichirou, the one Caster is protecting.

"So? You have something you want to ask me?"
He says so in his usual manner.
I don't feel a presence as a magus from Kuzuki.
No, I don't even feel his desire to win the Holy Grail War.
Then

"Kuzuki. Are you controlled by Caster?"
It's possible that Kuzuki is controlled by Caster like Archer said.
I can't fight against Kuzuki until I get this cleared up.


Caster emits an intent to kill.
That alone tells me the question is off-limits for her.

"What an annoying boy. I should kill you."
Her words are not a threat.
But...
"Hold on. Why are you asking that, Emiya?"
Kuzuki stops her in his usual manner.

"There should be reasoning behind your question. Tell me."

...My throat is dry.
It must be Caster's intent to kill. The robed figure tells me I'll be killed if I say something bad.
I bear it and...

"I don't know how you became a Master. But you're an honest human, right? Then you shouldn't be overlooking what Caster's doing.
 But since it seems you are overlooking it, I thought you just might not know about it."
I say so while glaring at Caster.

"What Caster is doing?"
"...Yeah. She's putting up her fort at the Ryudou Temple and collecting magical energy from the people in this town. All the coma incidents happening recently are her doing."


"There will be more victims. I'm sure someone will die as long as Caster keeps draining magical energy.
 ...She said everyone in town is her sacrifice. It won't be long before it's too late."

"I see. A normal human being would not be able to let her be.
 So you thought I might be controlled since I am letting her do as she wishes."

"...Yeah. But if you're overlooking her deeds knowing what she's doing, then you're just a killer. We won't hold back on you. But it's a different story if you're controlled.
 We'll just defeat Caster."
"No. This is the first time I heard about this."

Kuzuki declares so firmly.
I don't think it's a lie. Kuzuki Souichirou is straight-forward like when he is teaching.

"Phew."
I sigh with relief, while keeping watch on Caster.
Kuzuki-Sensei is a victim if he's controlled by Caster.
Then all that's left is to defeat Caster

"But Emiya. Is Caster's doing so bad?"
But still.
Kuzuki Souichirou plainly says so.

"Wh... at...?"

"It does not concern me how many strangers die. And besides, Caster has not taken anyone's life.
 ...But I must say, you aren't very thorough, Caster. You should have drained all of their energy if that is the case."

"!"
He's not any different from usual.
Kuzuki Souichirou gives his honest opinion.

"Kuzuki, are you going to involve innocent people in this!!!!?"
"I do not care about anyone. ...Well, you correctly guessed my nature.
 I am not a magus. I am just a killer that has rotted away."

Kuzuki takes a step back.
He watches us from behind Caster.

"You are right that I am Caster's puppet.
 I do not care about the Holy Grail War. If Caster and you two are going to kill each other, I will just observe.
 But"

"I value my own life. I do not care what Caster is scheming. I only kill those that are attacking me.
 Do as you wish, Caster. You can kill them or not."

Caster is standing in front of us with an expression of victory.

"Geez, they're both big foxes...!"
Tohsaka complains, but she doesn't move.
No, she cannot move.
In terms of skills as magi, we have no chance of beating Caster.
Masters are magi, so we cannot match an excellent magus like Caster

"I see.
 Then you do not mind dying here, Caster's Master?"

"...Huh?"
I hear a voice from behind me.
Before I can turn around...
The Servant of the sword, Saber, charges forward.

"Saber!?"
Even my voice won't catch up to her.
Saber is already armed and charges at Kuzuki like the wind.

"Stop, Saber!"

Caster confronts Saber with her casting.
She uses five verses for her spell.
If Saber is a wind for charging ten meters in a flash, Caster is a lightning for finishing her spell even faster.
It's a raging thunder at that.
She shoots off five bullets of light in under a second, and the bullets pierce Saber like fatal thorns!
"Magic resistance...! No, I don't know a knight that can defend against my magic...!"

Caster screams.
Even Archer had to evade Caster's spell, but Saber is nullifying it just by glaring at it.

Saber's not looking at Caster.
Her target...
The one she has to slash is Caster's Master, Kuzuki Souichirou...!

Saber slashes Kuzuki without hesitation.
"Souichirousama."
...The intersection becomes silent again.
Saber stops after slashing her sword.
Everyone here thinks that the battle is over due to the incredible speed.

Yes.
       Everyone except Kuzuki Souichirou, who is standing there calmly.
Hi, is everyone doing well? This is the place that saves Shirou, who has died by letting his guard down for just a moment, the Tiger Dojo session 19!
We have a special guest this time. Flying head tribe, RIN.
How do you feel, RIN-san?
Kill Shirou.
(She's wonderful...!)
Um, I understand how you feel, but please restrain yourself.
Shirou's action of putting priority on Saber over Rin was professional negligence resulting in death.
But it can't be helped!
It just means Saber-chan had more charm as a woman than RIN-san. That's why you weren't protected when it counted!
Well, it just wasn't your day today. Try to act cute next time so it won't end up like this!

But Shirou should contemplate his actions as well!
In that situation, you should place priority on Tohsaka-san over Saber-chan.
I know it's hard to abandon Saber-chan, but you should protect Tohsaka-san instead even if it's JUST Tohsaka-san.
Gyaa!! T-T-T-The head is moving!?
R-RIN-san... um... where are you going, if I may ask...?
Just going to kill Shirou.
KYAAA!!!!!
RUN, PLEASE RUN!!
(...She sure is wonderful!)

I cut the codfish.
I've cut up the cabbage, and the white radish is grated.
"...All right. All I need to do is put these in the soup and put it on the stove..."

The pot is boiling.
It's a simple dish, so the soup is like the only thing I can work on.
That went well, so all that's left is to prepare the plates

"I'm home! Man, it's so cold that it started snowing."
There's commotion as Fuji-Nee comes home.
"Welcome home. It started snowing outside?"

"Yeah. It's not much, but it looks like it'll pile up. Wow, we're having pot food for dinner? Great going, Shirou. Wow, I feel good. Maybe I should have some alcohol."
Fuji-Nee goes into the living room, saying scary things.

"Hello, Fujimura-Sensei."
"Oh, it's Tohsaka-san. What's going on? It's rare for me to see you here."

......?
Fuji-Nee naturally accepts Tohsaka's greeting.
She hums, goes past the living room, and comes into the kitchen.

"Wow, that's a good codfish. They say white codfish is the best, so sake's really gonna taste good with that."

Fuji-Nee opens the refrigerator.
Then.
After taking out a snack and eating it...

"WAIT, WHY IS TOHSAKA-SAN HERE!!!!!?"

"Hey, Tohsaka-san! It's not 'hello'. What are you doing here at this time!?"
After swallowing her snack, Fuji-Nee marches into the living room.

"Emiya-kun is treating me to dinner. As for you, aren't you lacking a bit of common courtesy, coming in here without ringing the doorbell?"
The Tohsaka army calmly counterattacks Fuji-Nee.

"Ugh... I-I'm a supervisor here!
ShirEmiya-kun's dad put me in charge here, so I'm like family here!"

"I see. Then I shall formally greet you.
 Hello, Fujimura-Sensei. I spent the whole day here. I will continue to study for the exam with Emiya-kun after dinner, but please do not mind us."

"WhaShirou... no, Emiya-kun! What is the meaning of this!? Since when did you decide to hold a study session with Tohsaka-san!?"

"Sensei? Please do not push yourself if it is hard to address him that way.
 It does not concern me how you may call Emiya-kun. I do not care if you call him by his name or with '-chan' added on. I respect people's privacy."

"UghTohsaka-san, did you hear about it from Sakura-chan...?"
"I cannot say what Matou-san was talking about, since I must respect her privacy as well. But I wish it is as you imagine."

Fuji-Nee falters in front of Tohsaka's smile.
...I understand how Fuji-Nee feels.
You feel pressured and cornered when she makes that smile...

"I guess the match is decided. I can leave them now."
Actually, it wasn't even a match to begin with.
It's only a matter of time before Tohsaka talks Fuji-Nee down.
I'll let Tohsaka take care of it and I'll go cook dinner

The snow stops before the pot is empty.
It only snowed for about two hours, so I bet there's only a bit of snow out there.

"Shirou, I put the dishes in the sink."
"Oh, thanks. I'll go wash them real quick."
I get up and head to the kitchen.

"Are you doing the dishes? Maybe I should do it. It doesn't balance out if I'm the only one getting treated."
Tohsaka gets up as Fuji-Nee sits down.
The proposal is delightful, but I can't let a guest do the dishes.

"No, you'll just owe me one. Just sit there since you just ate. And Fuji-Nee, you're to go prepare the bath."
"All right, I know."
Fuji-Nee is obedient, maybe because she's full now.
It'd be easy for me if she were always like this, but that'd be kind of boring as well.

"Oh."
I dropped another plate.
It's been twenty minutes since I started doing the dishes. This is the second plate I've dropped on the floor.

"......Hm."
I can't excuse myself saying that it's because my left hand is numb. I must be lacking concentration if I'm dropping dishes because of such a small problem.


I calmly think for a second that I should put it off until my left arm heals, but I shake off the idea.

I roll up my sleeves and continue with the dishes.
I can only accept it if it's some outside factor, but I can't accept an internal factor causing it.
There's no way I can't win against myself, so I can't admit defeat.

"Hm"
As a result, I recklessly increase the damage.
This is the third plate I've dropped.
I put a towel below me after I dropped the first one, so it fortunately did not break.

So it shouldn't be a problem, but

It's really awkward having Tohsaka's eyes on me every time I drop a plate.

"...Fujimura-Sensei. Is Emiya-kun always like that?"
I can hear Tohsaka from the living room.

"Don't be stupid. Shirou has never broken a plate before. I bet he's nervous because you're here."
Because you're his enemy.
Fuji-Nee adds.


Tohsaka ignores her and stares at me.

"......"
...This is hard.
Half my body is numb, so if she watches me and distracts mewhoa.

"Damn."
I cluck my tongue and look down at the broken plate.
This is the fourth one now. I knew I was going to drop it, but I couldn't move my left hand quickly enough.
"......"
I slowly look behind me...


...She's watching me.
Tohsaka is observing me really closely.

Then.
She suddenly gets up and comes over here.

"Emiya-kun. I'll do it, so you go and rest."
"But..."
"Don't step on the broken plate, okay? I can figure out where to put what, so you can go drink some tea."
Tohsaka rolls up her sleeves and stands by the sink.


I guess it can't be helped.
It's hard to stop Tohsaka once she makes up her mind, and to be honest...
...It's vexing, but Tohsaka looks so beautiful when she's washing the dishes that I'm fascinated by her figure.

Fuji-Nee's the only one in the living room when I get out of the bath.
Tohsaka's shoes are still at the entrance, and I bet Saber's at the dojo.
It's almost nine o'clock now. I
The problem is Tohsaka.
It's getting late, so I have to get her to go home.

"Fuji-Nee, do you know where Tohsaka is?"
"I think Tohsaka-san went out into the yard. She asked me what was over there in the corner."

"Corner of the yard...?"
Does she mean the shed?
But why would she have any business there?

"It's so cold."
The winter air cools down my warm body.
I can't see the stars because of the clouds, and there is snow all over the grass.

"...Man. What's Tohsaka doing out here in the cold?"
I go through the yard, shivering.
I consider buying a coat while I make my way over to the shed.

"Emiya-kun!?"
"Come on, what are you doing here? It's getting late, so we don't have time to be playing around."

"Oh, yeah. This place is certainly cold."
"......"
She's suspicious.
She acts so suspiciously that I'm starting to get curious.

"Tohsaka. The door to the shed is open."
"T-That's not me! It was open when I first got here!"

"That's strange. I thought I locked it from the outside."
"That's a false charge. First of all, you can only lock that worn-out door from the inside."

"Yup, that's right. The door is always open and you can only lock it from the inside. So, how do you know that, Tohsaka?"

"!"
She bites her lip.
I'm beginning to understand that Tohsaka is really weak against surprise attacks coming from unexpected places.

"I don't care. There isn't anything in there, right?
 That's my training place, but all I do there is practice my strengthening magic. Isn't it like child's play for you?"
I urge Tohsaka to go back to the house.

...Then.
"I see. So you're not self-conscious of it, huh?"
Tohsaka glares at me as if challenging me.

"Tohsaka...?"
I ready myself at the sudden change of atmosphere.
Tohsaka narrows her eyes after seeing my reaction.

"I thought so. It's natural for your magic to fail if the one making it is like that."
"Hold on. Are you talking about the projection magic?"

"Yeah. I'm talking about the 'replicas without anything inside' in the shed.
 ...I bet you don't know how ridiculous that is. You have no process or simplification. You're ridiculous in every way, trying to use projection magic as an extension of strengthening magic."

"Well, I'm sorry.
 But I don't intend for it to succeed since the projection magic is only a practice for the strengthening magic. It's only a way for me to confirm my basics."

"I'm telling you that's the ridiculous part. You're using projection to confirm your basics? ...Try telling that to a magus other than me. They'll put you in formalin along with your brain."


I gulp.
Tohsaka sounds serious, and there's no humor in her voice at all.

"...I'm sorry, Tohsaka. I don't quite get what you're trying to say, but are you trying to tell me to practice more?"

"That's obvious. All you can do is keep training.
 But yeahif we want to make you stronger, you might become useful if we change your process just a bit."
Where did that anger go? Tohsaka starts to ponder seriously.

"Hm...? Change the process? You mean my strengthening magic?"
"What were you listening to, you thickhead!? It's the projection magic!
 We can't count on strengthening magic done by an amateur, but the projection magic is different. You were able to temporarily project Archer's swords, so you'll immediately be a force if you can do that again!"

"...Tohsaka. That's plausible, but yesterday was just luck. I won't be able to do it again even if you tell me to."

"That's why you're an amateur! If you're able to do it by chance or by will, you should be able to do it anytime!
 ...First of all, that wasn't luck at all. Magi that work on the outside world like me have a lot of magic that we can't use. But you're getting all the required materials from within you, so there shouldn't be any magic that's impossible for you."

"Hm? Getting it from the inside...?"
...Isn't that natural?
Magical energy is made from the Magic Circuit within you, so it's all coming from within you.

"......Geez. I guess it can't be helped since you taught yourself, but this is pretty bad. Projection doesn't even need to be mentioned, but I guess I have to teach you from scratch about everything else as well."
Tohsaka sighs.


I know I'm an amateur, but it pisses me off if Tohsaka says so.

"Heh, that's none of your business. I've been able to do fine just by myself, so I should be fine by myself in the future. But what are we going to do about the meeting? It's getting late, so we can't waste time forever."

"Huh? What time is it?"
"It's nine right now. It's not a time girls should be walking about."

"Oh, that's still early. Well, let's finish the meeting quickly if you say so."
Tohsaka nods and heads back to the house.

"...Why is it still early?"
For a girl, going outside at nine o'clock is like midnight.
But she still said it's early.... Is Tohsaka not self-conscious that she's a girl?
"No, let's stop that scary thought."
I shake my head and erase the ominous thought.

"Come on!"
Tohsaka calls to me.
I run to the porch.
...I'll rest before we resume the strategy meeting.
The relationship between cat, table heater, and mandarins.
It's been snowing outside, so it'd be nice to relax in here.
We don't have table heater at our place, though.

"Huh? You're going to eat some mandarins?"
"Yeah. There's still a boxful left, and they'll rot if we don't eat them.
 Three boxes were unexpected, but you went and bought them. It'll be a waste unless we eat them all."
I sit on the cushion and pour some tea.

"Ehehe. Then I'll give you three."
"I just ate, you idiot. I can't eat that many."
I take two and start peeling the skin off.

I don't know where Tohsaka went, but I'm sure she'll be back soon.
I want to relax until I finish eating these...

"Hey, Shirou. I think Saber-chan went to the dojo. Aren't you going to take her some tea?"
"Hmm, yeah. Hold on, I'll go take her some after I finish eating one."

"Hold on. I'll do it, so you can rest here.
 But don't you have to keep Tohsaka-san company? Even though you invited her with sheer determination, she'll hate you if you leave her alone."

"Uh, guh...!"
I swallow the piece in my mouth.
F-Fuji-Nee, how did you arrive at that conclusion...!?

"T-That's a misunderstanding, you idiot...! I wasn't the one who invited her today, and I don't care if she likes me or not...!"

"Oh, really? It looked like you were conscious of Tohsaka-san all throughout dinner."
"That's just your imagination!!! I don't know what she's doing, but we're going to finish our business after she gets back, and I'm going to kick her out of the house after that!"

"Oh, I see. I guess it was a misunderstanding.
 Then I'm going to go take some mandarins and tea to Saber-chan."

Fuji-Nee puts the food onto the tray and leaves.
Heh, go away. Now I can really relax.

I silently eat the mandarin after Fuji-Nee leaves.
Tohsaka isn't back and I have nothing else to do, so I keep on eating.
I finally finish the third mandarin, lay on the floor, and right when I let my guard down...

"But Shirou. You like Tohsaka-san more than Saber-chan, right?"
"Yeah."
I reply on reflex.

"F-F-F-Fuji-Nee...!"
"See, you let your guard down."
Fuji-Nee runs away in a flash.
I don't go after her.

"...Well, I've known Tohsaka for a longer time, she's pushy, red, and..."
I repeat strange excuses with a red face.

...So.
When I finally calm down and when Fuji-Nee comes back, Tohsaka comes back as well.
All right.
I'll pull myself together and get back to the main objective.
We get away from Fuji-Nee, who's in the living room, and continue the meeting out on the porch.
I expected it not to finish so easily because we've talked so much since noon, but...

"It's impossible to challenge the Ryudou Temple at the moment.
 The only thing we can do is to set up some sort of trap to lure Caster out."
Tohsaka concludes.

"Well. You're... right, but..."
"The problem is the trap.
 ...Well, I have two or three possible ideas, so you can stand by for now. In the worst case, I'll have you and Saber be the bait."

After saying something dangerous, Tohsaka opens the sliding door.
The cold air comes in.
Maybe this porch is special, as it's only a bit chilly.
...It's just like that night five years ago.
This porch is warm enough to be able to sit down and watch the moon even during wintertime.

"It's a good boundary field. I feel some human emotion, unlike the one at my place."
Tohsaka murmurs while sitting at the porch, staring into the yard.
"Do you want to sit here with me? I just want to talk."


I sit next to her silently.
She said she wants to talk, but she doesn't say anything.
I can't do anything else, so I stare at the yard absent-mindedly.


I can't see the moon.
My breath is white, probably because it snowed earlier.
When I look to my side, Tohsaka is staring at the yard with white breath as well.


I can touch her shoulder if I move a bit.
I'm not disturbed by that fact.
Is it because I'm getting used to it or because of the winter night?
Tohsaka is so close to me, but I feel so calm.

"So, what do you want to talk about, Tohsaka?"
I ask her, feeling that she's waiting for that question.

"...Hm. Well, this place is a bit special. I just thought that you might be fine as you are right now."

"Whoa. Do you mean I'm good enough as an amateur?"
"Not exactly, but maybe so.
 I don't know what kind of a magus Emiya Kiritsugu was, but this place is really natural. It's very open even though this is the workshop of a magus.
 All the doors are open, free for anyone to come in and leave. It's probably not bounded by anything because there's no knowledge here to protect."

"I think that's what your dad meant by telling you to become a magic user and not a magus. You have nothing, but in its place, you can go anywhere."

"What? You're not like that?"
"No, my place is different. My mansion is called a haunted house, and it really is. It rejects anybody that comes, yet it doesn't release anyone that comes in."

"...I sometimes think it's wrong, but it's not something I can change.
 It's not like it's cursed, but it's just that I like how it is. I was chosen as the successor probably because of my personality. But it was pretty shocking when I realized it."

"Hm. Is that when you realized that you're a bully?"
"......You're not one to mince words, huh?"
"Really? I thought I was being indirect, just like you."
"...Geez. I'm telling you that's direct."

She sighs and hangs her head.
Her sigh is white and slowly melts into the cold night.

...Seeing her face makes me remember...
The red school.
Tohsaka didn't say anything when she saw the unconscious students.
In spite of her shaking knees, she bit her lip and acted firm as usual.

...I realized at that time.
That she might be killing her true self by acting like a perfect magus.

"Was it hard for you, Tohsaka?"
I get uneasy, so I ask.

"You mean the training? Sorry, but I never thought it was hard. I was able to do most things without a problem, and I was never discouraged because I couldn't do something.
 And it was fun for me to learn new things. I told you, right? I was born with this personality. So there's no need for you to worry."

She simply says so.
There's no bluff nor lie in her statement, and Tohsaka is smiling.

"I see. Then what about school? If you're going to live as a magus, isn't it meaningless to go to school?"

"It's not meaningless, but it is straying away from my path.
 But it's not pointless. Being a student is fun. I'm up for anything fun. It's a duty to succeed my dad, but I wouldn't do it if it wasn't fun.
 I became a Master because I wanted to test my powers, and I'm cooperating with you because you're funny."


Ignoring the comment that I'm funny, my worries disappear.

A family of magi.
I thought Tohsaka was carrying a dark shadow because she's bound by a heavy history and bloodline.
But that was just my prejudice.
The "Tohsaka family" is not a burden on her, and she's done what she wanted up to now.

"I see. I'm glad you're having fun."
"Thanks. So, I'm sure you were having fun too if you're saying that, right? You wouldn't be able to continue training unless that's the case."
Tohsaka says so as if it's natural.
But...
"Hm"
I can't nod back.

"...Hey. why are you silent? Your dad didn't force you, right? But you continued training in spite of that, so that must mean it was fun."

"Uh, well"
I don't think I ever considered it fun.
For Emiya Shirou, magic has always been a life-threatening trial.

I know I don't have the aptitude.
But I clung on to it, wanting to be like Kiritsugu.

For my first year, I trained all the time except for sleeping and eating.
I honed my sensitivity, facing death every night.
I just repeated it for eight years.
I didn't think it was tough, but I didn't think it was fun.

"...Wait. Answer me, Emiya-kun.
 I might have severely misunderstood you."
Tohsaka glares at me seriously.

"......"
...Crap.
I have to answer her if she makes a face like that.

"Yeah. I never thought training in magic was fun. I never considered magic or training to be fun. But I was glad to have people around me be happy. Um, I thought I could be of help to someone if I studied magic."


"I wanted to be a superhero like Kiritsugu. I learned magic for that reason. ...Well, that's my reason."

"Then what? You didn't learn magic for your own good?"
"Huh? ...Wait, isn't this for my sake? I'm glad to be of help to someone."

"Hey now. You may be glad, but you're not having fun!
 Look, I'm talking about what's fun for you. I'm asking you if there's anything you consider fun!"
Tohsaka roars out.


Even if she says so, I can't answer what I don't know.
I can't think of anything that's fun for me, and most of all
I'm not qualified to have such a wish.

"That makes me mad! In short, you're just caring for others and not caring for your own self!"
She suddenly stands up and points at me.

"Huh? Wait, Tohsaka, your finger...!"
Your finger, no, your nail is touching my nose!

"Shut up! Don't talk back to me! Geez, I always thought you two were alike, but I didn't think you guys were this similar!"
Rejecting my protest, Tohsaka closes in on me even more.

"Hold on. Calm down, Tohsaka. Why are you so mad?"
"I'm angry because you can't tell! Geez, why did nobody tell you!?"
She shakes her fist.


I'll have to stay silent for now.
I'll stay quiet until Tohsaka's anger goes away.

...So.
After venting for a while...
"Heh. Fine, I've decided.
 I'll make you admit defeat tomorrow."
She says so as if smacking me with a glove.

"...That's disturbing. Are we going to continue that fight?"
"That fight", of course, is when she chased me around the school.
I was cornered and had to surrender, but the match wasn't settled because of Rider's interruption.

"Yup. You better be ready. I'll smack you a good one."
Tohsaka psyches herself up before walking off into the living room.

"Hm."
I don't know what's going to happen.
So should I be ready for anything...?

Anyway, I have to take Tohsaka home.
It's almost ten o'clock.
I don't know what Fuji-Nee will say if I keep a girl at my place for so long.

"Huh? What did you say, Shirou?"
"I said I'm going to walk Tohsaka home. ...Where is she anyway? It's about time she left."

Fuji-Nee is watching me with blank amazement.
...That's weird.
Fuji-Nee should approve right away, but she doesn't seem to be in a hurry.

"Hmm. I think Tohsaka-san is in the outbuilding.
 She's a guest, so she has to have a proper guest room if she's staying over, right?"
"All right, the outbuildingwait, don't be ridiculous, Fuji-Nee. Did you just say something strange?"

"Geez, you're the one saying strange things, Shirou.
 You're going to let Tohsaka-san stay over because it's so late, right? Tohsaka-san just came and told me so."
"WhaTohsaka is staying over...!?"

"Yup. But you can't do anything strange, okay?
 I'll be sleeping in the Japanese-style room, so I'll go kill you in one blow if I hear a scream from the guest room."

Fuji-Nee munches on the rice cracker.
She seems normal, and it seems she thinks nothing of the emergency situation of having Tohsaka stay over.

"Damn her!"
It looks like Fuji-Nee has surrendered to Tohsaka.

"Oh, great timing. I'm going to borrow the guest room on the right."
Then.
The alien I bump into on my way to the outbuilding says so lightheartedly.

"Uhum."
Her appearance makes my head spin.
She's not in her uniform.
This person is in my hallway, saying something ridiculous.

"Oh, this? I'm going to stay over, so I had Archer bring me things. I don't need to borrow any pajamas."

"UhUh?"
"Are you all right? Go to bed early if you're tired. I won't forgive you if you sleep in tomorrow."
Waving goodbye, she goes down the hallway leading to the outbuilding.

In a daze, I watch her go and look at myself in the mirror.
"
"
My face is as red as an apple.
...Damn it.
What's she thinking, sleeping in the same house even if we're far away from each other?

"...I should take a bath again."
I'll pour cold water on myself and cool my burning face down.
...Um, I'll have to do so or I won't be able to concentrate on my training, having Tohsaka in my head
"It's morning..."
I slowly open my eyes.
The night that felt like it'd last forever has ended.

"......Good. The pain's gone."
I don't know if I could not bear the pain anymore or if the pain went away at some point.
Anyway, I feel no pain and I don't feel sleepy nor tired.
My head has cleared up, as I managed to get about three hours of sleep.

"All right. I'll go make breakfast."
I get up from the sweaty futon.
...Then.
As soon as I get up, my left foot slips.

"Huh?"
I touch my left foot thinking it's strange.
There's nothing wrong with it.
There's no pain nor blood, andI don't feel like I'm touching my leg.

"......Hm."
I don't feel anything on my left leg or my left arm.
I try pinching the left side of my chest and, again, feel nothing.

"......"
I guess my body hasn't fully healed yet, even though the pain went away.
The whole left side of my body is numb and it doesn't feel like it's my body. Um, I think something like this happens frequently

"It's like when I sleep in a wrong position in the shed. I'd use my arm as a pillow and blood wouldn't be flowing in it when I woke up."
Yeah, that.
This is like the numbing one gets from having the blood circulation to a limb cut off temporarily.

Well, it moves fine, so it should heal in time.
It reacts slowly and it feels like I'm moving it using a controller, but it shouldn't hinder my everyday life if I'm careful.

I refrain from using a knife this morning and make a simple breakfast consisting mainly of bread.
My dominant hand, the right hand, is good, so I can use the frying pan.
I cook some ham and eggs, instant clam chowder, and make breakfast for three.

"Itadakimasu."
"Itadakimasu."
The two bow and dig into the toast.

Saber eats the toast and salad like always, munching and nodding.
...Yeah.
It's interesting to see Saber using chopsticks, but Western food suits her more.


Saber's usually quiet.
It's not that she's untalkative, but it seems like she considers silence a virtue.
So this is how she is during meals.
It's easier for me to stay quiet during meals, so a meal like this is ideal for me.

"...Huh?"
Then, I realize why it's so quiet this morning.

In a word...

"Hey, morning! ...Oh? We're having French food this morning?"
...Fuji-Nee didn't stay over last night.

"Yup. I cooked French food this morning. So just be quiet and eat."
I give Fuji-Nee her mug.

"Hm? But this kind of smells like instant food, Shirou."
"It's just your imagination. Your nose isn't working too well since you just woke up."

"I see. You might be right. Oh, good morning to you too, Saber-chan. I'm sorry I couldn't come home last night."
Fuji-Nee gulps down the hot clam chowder like some kind of sports drink.
I bet there's some special coating on her throat.

"Good morning, Taiga. I did not see you yesterday. Was something wrong?"
"Hm? Yeah, I had to work... well, no. I'm just going around visiting people who are sick. But that ended yesterday, so I can relax again today."

She puts margarine on her bread while she's speaking.
It doesn't really matter, but Fuji-Nee doesn't use butter.
I can ask her why, but I don't want to since I'm sure I'll get a stupid response.

"......Hey, Fuji-Nee. How many students are in a serious condition out of the ones who went to the hospital?"
"No one's in a serious condition. They're all just staying at the hospital to be safe, and I hear they can all come back to school next week.
 It's all right, Shirou. Just relax, and don't worry about that incident."

Fuji-Nee bites into her toast.
She looks so carefree that looking at her makes me feel like I can trust her.

"I see. That's good."
"Yup, everything's all right. I'll be looking forward to dinner tonight."

She has a peaceful smile.
...Yeah. At times like this, she reminds me that Fuji-Nee is Fuji-Nee.

"Then I'll be going. Please take care of the house while I'm gone, Saber."
"Yes. That is fine, but... Shirou. I did not see anything made in the kitchen. Am I to go without lunch today...?"

"...? Oh, no. I can come home early today since it's Saturday. I'll be a bit late, but I'll be back by lunchtime to make lunch."

"I see. Shirou, it is troubling if you do not tell me about such matters. It seems you are pretty careless this morning. Your reactions are slow too. Do you have something that is worrying you?"

"Huh? No. My body's still heavy from yesterday, but this should get back to normal in no time."
The left side of my body is still numb, but it doesn't hurt, so there's no problem.
I can't tell Saber about such a thing and worry her.

"Well, you're right that it's my fault. Meals are your only hobby. I'll make a big lunch to show my apology, so let's call it even."
I wave goodbye and go to the door.

"Hm. I cannot agree with what you just said. It is only that I would not have energy in emergencies if I skip meals"
"Just forget about it. See ya, Saber!"

I leave Saber's complaints behind me.
"Whoathis is more tiring than I thought."

I touch my numb left leg.
It didn't happen when I was in the house, but I start feeling sick once I start walking.
Even though it doesn't affect my movements, it's a big mental burden to walk with a numb body.

"...No, I have to bear it. This is nothing compared to those two."
Even though she healed up, Saber got her throat cut and was smashed against a wall.
Tohsaka took that hammer-like blow to her chest.
It should be nothing for me, as I didn't actually take a hit.

"Well."
I step out with my numb left leg and start walking down the hill.
...I feel slightly nauseous.
I walk to school with ghost-like steps.

...Then.
School's over before I notice it.

It might be because of my body, but I don't have a sense of time.
I don't remember anything about the lectures, and I'm not too sure what I did either.

"Could this be bad?"
The left side of my body is still numb.
Even though I don't feel anything, having it numb for so long gets me worried.

"I don't feel it, but it seems like it's getting heavier."
...The nausea won't go away either. And, of course, Kuzuki wasn't at school.

"I'll go home. Saber's probably hungry."
I grab my bag to go home.
I think I've forgotten to do something, but I should remember once I go home and rest.

"Oh."
I remember when I walk up the hill with my numb left leg.

"I forgot to talk to Tohsaka."
I forgot about it since I had my hands full with my body, and since my head was spaced out.
Well, I'm sure nothing big happened since she didn't come see me.
Considering my condition, I can contact her once I get better.

"I'm home."
I announce myself loudly and head to the kitchen.

I put the food I bought in the refrigerator, wash my hands, and put on my apron.
I'll be making codfish pot tonight, so I'll use some meat for lunch.
I think about making teriyaki chicken and start getting ready.

"Are you home, Shirou?"
Saber must have heard me, as she comes in from the porch.

"Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late. You can rest while I cook. You must be hungry"
...Crap.
I dropped the dish in my hand since I was preoccupied with Saber.

"Shirou, the plate is broken."
"Yeah. That's the first time I've done something like that."
I'm surprised as well, so I respond stupidly.

"Sorry. I'll clean it up right away, so you can sit right there."
I pick up a piece.
"Huh?"
I drop it.

"It seems you are tired, Shirou.
 No, I will clean it up, so you go ahead and cook."

I guess trying to pick it up with my left hand was a mistake.
...Well, that's a good lesson.
My left hand is still numb, so I'll be really careful when using the kitchen knife.

"Shirou. Please do not push yourself. Please make something simple. I am glad that you are trying to do your best, but I do not want your blood in our meal."
Well, I don't want that either.
I'd be a failure as a cook.

"All right. Then I'll put effort into dinner and make a simple lunch. I'll still make what I was planning to, but I won't use any pumpkin or white radish. Is that all right?"
I take 200 grams of chicken, put it on the cutting board, and carefully ready my fork.
I have to make the main dish with care because of what I told Saber this morning.

"Yes. I will be looking forward to it, Shirou."
Saber replies, as if she can sense my enthusiasm.


I'm more enthusiastic now.
I'll poke some holes first with the fork and

"...Doorbell?"
"Shirou, it seems there is a visitor."
"I guess so. I'll go get it."
The lights go out.
It's midnight, right when the date changes. I concentrate on my training while looking up at the frozen moon.

"Trace, on."
I insert a new nerve into my spine.
I make a Magic Circuit within me, make magical energy, and understand the structure of the wooden sword in my hand.

"Basic structure, analyzed."
I put magical energy into it and "strengthen" the wooden sword.
I analyze the structure, alter it, and reinforce the matter.

"Composition, reinforce."
The usual process goes too smoothly.
...I don't know if it's because I became a Master, but I can now easily strengthen things which used to have a success rate in the .01 digits, and I can make a Magic Circuit in a flash.

"......"
...No, it's not because I became a Master.
I'm only copying it.

His swords.
I'm only imitating that knight in red that I saw at the Ryudou Temple.
I'm imitating his twin swords, his sword technique, and now even his breathing.

"...This is a fake. This isn't what's mine."
I can't help but feel self-hatred.
Emiya Shirou's skills improve just by imitating him.
I know it's not my own power, but I have to rely on it.

It was because of his techniques that I was able to fight off those bone creatures at school, and it was because of his projected swords that I was able to fend off Kuzuki's attacks.
...Even now.
I know that I can reproduce those swords if I seriously follow the manufacturing process.

"...It's falsely similar to strengthening. I just have to put the start and the finish, separate it into exactly eight sections..."
Not trace on (sympathy start), but trace on (projection start).
...The words are still the same.
There's no need to change the spell if it still works on me.
First of all, I only know and can use one spell to change myself.


I put down the "strengthened" wooden sword.
...The left side of my body is still numb.
I was optimistic that it would heal if I rested today, but it wasn't that convenient.
If this is the compensation for magic above my level, duplicating Archer's twin swords, I might destroy myself if I "project" one more time.

"Phew."
I remove the nerve inside my spine.
My body is free of the poison called the Magic Circuit, and tension escapes my body.
Then...
"Shirou? Are you not able to sleep?"
Saber quietly comes inside.

"No, that's not it. This is my daily routine, so don't worry about it."
I must be relaxed, done with my daily routine.
My voice is surprisingly gentle.

"It was lively today."
"Yeah. Even though they're different, it was like having two Fuji-Nees here."
I answer her smile with a smile.
Saber agrees and sits next to me.

"But you are training magic tonight as well? You do not change your routine no matter what happens."
"Huh...? Yeah, it was my father's teaching to do it without a day's rest. Well, that's all he taught me, though."

"That is it...? Then he has not taught you the magus's way, or his knowledge?"

"Nope. First of all, the one doing the teaching wasn't like a magus.
 He was a troublesome adult. He was usually spaced out and clumsy. He said he's going to enjoy what he likes, and he would play around like a child.
 You usually couldn't believe him when he called himself a sorcerer."

I can tell that I'm smiling as I tell the story.
About my past.
The five years between the time of the fire and Kiritsugu's death.
Come to think of it, that might have been the best time of my life.

"I see. So you liked him for who he was."

"...Yeah. Tohsaka might get angry if she hears it, but I admired him. He was free and not like a magus at all, but he was a true sorcerer to me.
 And, well. I couldn't leave him be because he was more immature than I was."

"Yes, I understand how you feel. I had a magus of my own, but that one was immature as well."
"That one...? Wow, it's rare for you to address somebody like that."

"He is an exception. He was an ancient man. I respected him and loved him. But at the same time, he was the cause of every trouble. It would have been a better age if he were not as mischievous."

"...Wow. That's some way to put it. He sounds like a real bad guy."

"He was. Worse still, he was weak against love affairs, or should I say full of love? Well, that led to the downfall that caused him to be confined. But knowing that old man, I am sure he is still casually talking about love."
Is she stunned or smiling?
Saber talks about her past and swallows her words a bit.

And after a brief silence.
"Shirou. What is going on with the left side of your body?"
She questions me with straight eyes about what I didn't want her to know.

"...What? You knew, Saber?"
"Anyone will notice if you break that many plates.
 So, how is it? From what I see, it seems the trouble is only in half your body."

"Well, it's not as bad as a trouble. It's just numb."
I explain to her how it felt weird from this morning, how it's not affecting my movements, and how it's probably the feedback from last night's projection magic.

"......"
Saber looks at me with uneasy eyes.
When I try to smile back to her, telling her it's all right...

"Most of your body is numb, huh? Well, it is natural."
The knight in red is standing at the door.

"Archer...!"
Saber jumps up as if to protect me.
...To her, he's an enemy that assaulted me.


...And he's an enemy to me as well.
'Drown in your ideals and die.'
Those words he said before he slashed me would not get out of my head

"What do you want, Archer? We should have a pact not to attack one another.  Leave right away if you are to follow your Master's order."

Archer does not answer, but takes another step.

"Stop! You had better be prepared if you are to take another step."
Saber's enmity turns into an intent to kill.

"...No, hold on, Saber. He's not willing to fight.
 And we can't fight here."
"Hm... That is true, but..."

"It's fine. So, what do you want, Archer?
 Knowing you, you didn't come here just to say hello, right?"
I push Saber aside and confront Archer.

...!
I still don't like him.
Our mentalities are different, but more than that, I just can't deal with him. I feel a chill running up my spine the instant I see him.
I bet he falls under the category of natural enemy.

"Hey. Get out if you have no business."
"......Heh. I heard you did projection, but it really is true, huh? Half your body is numb and your actions are misplaced about seven centimeters inside of you, right?"


I gasp.
Archer's comment is so accurate that it's scary.

"Let me see your body. I might be of some help."
Archer reaches out.

"......!"
"No, stop, Saber. ...I have to show you my body, right?"
I take my top off and show him my back.


Archer silently places his hand on my back.
"!"
I feel a small pain.
SensationI feel heat on the numb left side of my body as if needles are picking at it.

"...How fortunate for you. I thought it was necrosis, but you only opened up what was closed. This should heal within a few days."
"...Something closed opened up?"

"Yes. It seems you have misunderstood, but a Magic Circuit is not something you make each time, but something you reveal. Once you make it, it is something you reveal on the surface or not.
 ...You did not know this, so a circuit that should have been used was neglected and sleeping inside of you.
 It is something your master or Rin would not think of. A legitimate magus would never imagine a heretic whose nerves are his Magic Circuit."

"Your numbness is temporary. It is the result of full magical energy flowing into a circuit you have not used before, and it is only 'surprised' right now.
 But now, a wind has gone through the neglected section. The nerve will eventually recall its normal function, and the dormant circuit is now activated."

"!"
The needles poke my back again.
I feel a definite thumping from my numb body.

"...That should do. You should be a better magus when your body heals. At any rate, you're too greedy if you try to make my swords the first time."
Archer lets go.

"...Then there is nothing abnormal with Shirou's body?"
"It was abnormal up to now. ...No, it is normal for humans to keep such abnormalities asleep inside them. In that regard, Emiya Shirou is already abnormalbut oh well.
 Anyway, don't even think about using magic tomorrow. Numbness will be the least of your worries if you burn out the healing nerves."

"You are knowledgeable, Archer."
"I had a similar experience. I had one of my arms taken away when I did it for the first time. That is what it means to learn a new magic."

He turns and tries to leave.
"Hold on."
I stop him.
I want to know why he helped me now, after trying to kill me before.

"What? Are you going to ask Saber to fight me?"
"I won't do such a thing. I just want to ask you about what you said before."

Drown in your ideals and die.
The meaning of it.
The uneasiness in my brain won't go away unless I hear it out from him.

"It is just as it sounds. There is nothing to explain."
There's no hesitation.
Archer declares seriously.
"!"
That...
...Pisses me off so much that my whole vision turns white.

"Then what...!?
 You claim not to have any ideals, so what are you fighting for?
 Servants have an objective, right? Then what's the reason you fight? If you don't have an ideal, what are you fighting for?"

"It is simple. I fight for myself.
 Boring ways of the world, justice, ideal...
 Such vague reasons are meaningless. I fight to fulfill my own desires. There is no other reason."

"Yourselfjust for your own self?"
"Yes. Do as you wish if your desire is an ideal 'not to hurt anybody'. If you want to save others so much, go ahead.
 Butonly if it is truly your own desire."

"What?"
My mind freezes.
What... did... he just say?

"If you are fighting out of your own will, the resulting crime and punishment are all yours. The ideal requires that you be burdened with them..
 But if it is a borrowed intention, the ideal you speak of is only a fantasy."

          In a word, it is a fake.

"You need a reason to fight. But it cannot be an ideal. If you fight for ideals, the only thing you can save are ideals.
 There is no way you can save people."

I can't talk.
I can't think of any objections.
Archer's words pierce my heart like arrows.
But it goes the same for Saber as well.

"The reason why one fights is a desire to try to save something.
 At the very least, that is the case for you, Emiya Shirou. Isn't that right?"


"But salvation brought on by others is not a salvation. The only thing that saves a person is their own will and actions.
 A salvation brought on by others is like money.
 Once it is used, it will only go on to someone else."


...I can't speak.
Something...
I have to say he's wrong, so why...?

"That is why your ideal is meaningless.
 You can certainly fulfill your wish to 'save someone'. But a wish for you to save yourself does not exist.
 You will embrace a borrowed ideal that is not yours, and you will probably pursue it until you die."

            No, that's...

"That's all I wanted to say.
 There is nothing at the end of helping people. It is a false life that can save neither yourself nor others."

He turns his red back to us and leaves.


...I can't think of anything to say.

The darkness falls.
We cannot look at one another and just stare at the back of the guy who's no longer there

What did I wish for, and why?

There were people that were not saved, and there was me, who could not save them.
That should be the reason.
What happened after that, and what did I want to become?

...I remember the gray sky.
A dark sky on the verge of crying.
There, my will to fight for survival almost disappears.
One only dies when the will fades away.
Leaving behind many people, I survived a few minutes longer than everyone.

In the process, lots of things died.
That's why it was almost empty.
If the wish to stay alive dies, everything disappears.
If you have nothing, all that remains is to die.

And I died.
Thinking got difficult and I closed my eyesand right before everything turned black, my outstretched hand was grabbed by someone.

That was everything.
Everything disappeared.
There was nothing, so I only had that one thing.
I admired it severely since I could not do it.

...That's right.
I hoped to be of help to many people in place of all those I could not save.
But...
He said it is all false.

A borrowed ideal.
Salvation like a coin, passed from hand to hand.
A thankless end.



What did I want to become, and why?

       'I wanted to be a superhero.'

It's not me that said that, but

"!"
I wake up.
The light flowing in is bright, telling me it's sunny today, unlike yesterday.

"Damn. But I still have a headache."
I don't know if it's because of what happened last night, but I don't feel good at my awakening.
I must have had a bad nightmare, as my temples are throbbing in pain.
"Man... I'll go wash my face."

"Wow, it's really sunny."
Even though it's still six-thirty, the sky is clear blue.
It's warm for winter and the snow is all gone.

My sleepiness goes away once I wash my face and brush my teeth.
"Oh yeah. It's Sunday, so I don't have to go wake Fuji-Nee up."
I can prepare breakfast later than usual, and we can eat slowly as well.

There's no one in the living room.
"...So I'm the first one, huh? I can understand Fuji-Nee and Saber, but it's unexpected that Tohsaka is still sleeping."

Well, I'll prepare breakfast.
Even though it's Sunday, there are four people this morning.
I should start preparing

"Huh? There's no bread."
I bought a loaf yesterday, but it's gone along with the bag.

"Should I take it as sincerity that there are three 100-yen coins in its place?"
...I've never encountered such a crime.
The first suspect, Fuji-Nee, wouldn't do such an elaborate thing.
Then there's only one other culprit...

Well, what should I do?
I don't really care about the bread, but there is one extra person that'll be eating this morning.
"...It's before seven. I bet the tofu shop will be open."
"I'll make eggs and miso soup for breakfast. I don't want them to spoil."
The problem at hand is how to deal with the intruder that attacked the kitchen last night.

"Tohsaka. Are you awake, Tohsaka?"
There's no reply even after knocking on the guest room door.
It's almost seven.
Leaving Fuji-Nee aside for the moment, it should be impossible for Tohsaka, an honor student, not to be up at this time.

"Tohsaka. Tohsaka. Tohsaka!"
...That's strange.
There's no reply, so is she gone?

"...That's a bit weird."
...I get a bit worried.
It's not like she went out by herself and never returned, right?

"......Hm."
I'll
...Well, I know who the culprit is.
As the one in charge of cooking, I can't allow myself to waste precious time questioning her.
"Yeah. I should go buy some tofu if I have such time."
I'm overwhelmed by the crowd the instant I step out of the bus.
The station is filled with people.
It's a sunny Sunday morning, so it'd be stranger for it not to be crowded here.

"I am surprised. So many people gather here on Sunday."
Saber looks at the town in wonder.
Her reaction is to be expected, since she has never seen the town in daylight.

"......"
I'm also stunned by the crowd.
"Well, where should we go? Do either of you have any requests?"
But.
Unlike us, Tohsaka is full of energy.

"Uh... That's troubling. I don't know any fun places."
"I thought so. How about Saber? Do you have anywhere you want to go?"

"Me...? No, I do not have any particular place I am interested in. First of all, I am Shirou's guard.
 If this is a holiday for you two, please treat me as if I am not here."

"Wha-"
"Really? Then I can go wherever I want?
 Ohh. If you don't have any requests, does that mean you guys will give me absolute obedience to whatever proposal I make?"

"Wha, wha, wha-"
I feel a chill.
Tohsaka's eyes are scary.

"H-Hold on, don't say it in a scary way!
 First of all, I said I'd come with you, but I didn't say I'd go on a d-date with you. This is just to relax with the three of us"

"Too bad, this is what you call a date in society.
 Come on, give up already. Girls will hate you if you're so persistent."

"Whalike who?"
"Who could it be? Well, I guess being stubborn may be a strong point. Right, Saber?"

"Yes, Shirou hates losing. His persistent mind is reassuring during battles."
"See. Isn't it good, Shirou?"

"Kuh"
Tohsaka smiles.
Man, what's so fun about making fun of me!?

"Well, let's go to Verde first of all. You two haven't eaten breakfast yet, right? We'll go window-shopping after a quick cup of tea to warm ourselves up."

Tohsaka starts walking.
I think Verde is the name of the new department store that opened up.

"Hey, I'll leave you if you're slow. The breakfast menu only goes on till ten o'clock, so we have to hurry."

"Wai"
She doesn't stop even if I stop her.
It seems Tohsaka will not even give me time to calm down.

"Shirou. Rin is walking away."
"Kuhgeez, fine! I'll go anywhere now!"
I slap myself on the cheeks and summon up some resolve.

"Let's go, Saber! Don't get lost!"
"Yes. Please do not lose sight of Rin."

We run together.
Tohsaka doesn't even turn around in the crowded town.
It seems she's absolutely certain that we'll follow her.

So.
Before I know it, it's already past noon.

To be honest, I was just nervous for the first hour.
Everyone's paying attention to us wherever we go: bowling alley, cafe, shops...

Tohsaka stands out by herself.
Her vivid eye-catching red clothes and her long black hair.
Her colors would stand out on their own, but Tohsaka herself is beautiful.
It's natural for her to draw attention.

And Saber is standing next to her, so it doesn't even need to be said how gorgeous they look together.

But I wasn't nervous because of all the attention.
I realized that we were getting attention after my nervousness went away.
In short, I was just nervous about the fact that I'm on a date with Tohsaka.

I wasn't prepared at all, and I felt like I was in hell when we were in the cafe.
I can fight alongside her as a Master, but just the word "date" makes my heart jump.
We got so close that normal things have become difficult for me.


I thought the day would end like this.
I don't know what Tohsaka intended, but I was sure that I would go around town nervously until the day ended.

...That's why I thought it'd be better for us to go home quickly to have a strategy meeting.
So.
What kind of magic was cast to make it turn out like this?

"Wow, I laughed my heart out. You showed me some great stuff."
Tohsaka laughs while walking in the park.

"Really? I cannot tell. Shirou did not look like himself back then."

"That's what's good about it. I didn't think he would look so much like a rich nerdy kid just by putting glasses on. You should've bought that, Shirou."
Tohsaka must have loved it as she's still laughing.

...It all happened about ten minutes ago.
I don't know what she was thinking, but Tohsaka took us to a glasses store and played around by getting Saber to try on glasses.

I got involved as well, and one of the glasses just got her laughing.
It was a pair of thick formal glasses that she made me put on.

"...Man, forget about it already. Look, I'm never going to wear glasses ever again. I have a young-looking face, so I won't allow myself to look any younger."

"Huh? Oh, so you were self-conscious, huh? But I don't think it's a problem. I don't have an issue with the way you are now."

"There is a problem with the way I am now! I can't help it about my face, but I need more height!"
"Oh. I think you have an average height, Emiya-kun."
"It's not average. And I'll be better able to brace myself if I'm taller, right? I need at least Issei's height."

"You don't have to worry. You'll still grow."
"...I'm glad to hear that, but what's the reasoning behind that?"

"Huh? Um, well... you have a firm build, so you'll grow if you get the right nutrition, right? I thought you'd grow if you used photosynthesis."
"What plant are you talking about? Don't treat me like some kind of a flower."

"Oh. Are you mad...?"
"No. I'll ignore it. ...Well, I guess I can look forward to it if you say so."

"Yeah. I can't make any promises about your height, but you'll be a great guy. You have my guarantee on that, Shirou."
"Wha"
W-Why does she have to say such an embarrassing thing!?

"Hah, you're so embarrassed. I like you since your emotions show up on your face."
"!"
S-She's playing around with me.
She's definitely playing around with me.

"Guh, you evil woman! Is it fun to tease a guy your own age!?"

"Of course. It would depend on who, but your reactions are great."
......God.
Please show her your wrath with divine punishment.
Not just for my sake, but for the sake of all the guys at my school.

"Oh, let's stop playing around with Shirou and get on with the date. Do you want to let some stress out before lunch?"
She fists her hand and swings it.

"...Could it be...?"
I'm sure of it. She's making "that" gesture.
But would a girl come out and say she wants to go to such a place...?

"It's a batting cage, of course. Don't tell me you don't know it."
The (former) school idol asks me seriously.

"Of course I know!
 What I want to say is that batting cages aren't for girls"
Saying that, I imagine Tohsaka going into the batter's box.

"............"
...Crap. It does look strange, but why does she seem so reliable?

"What, do you want to go to an aquarium instead? I think they had penguin army versus the giant seal, the flaming freezing match, but it's a third rate attraction."


I think it's second-rate, but I don't know about going to an aquarium when it's so sunny out.

"Rin. What is this batting you are talking about?"
"Huh? Well, it's something you should be good at. It's an integration of all your physique, considered to be training in some cases."
Wow.
Tohsaka's putting it in a ridiculous way.

"Hm. I cannot ignore that."
"Yeah, you should try it since it feels so good. I bet you'll be able to win all the prizes there."
She agitates Saber irresponsibly and starts walking again.

"Sigh."
I watch her, then run after her since it can't be helped.
There's no point arguing against Tohsaka's energy.
I can't stop her, and I also kind of like being pulled around like this.

So that's what it means.
My nervousness went away because it's fun.
I was taken to many places without rest, and my anxiety was gone before I knew it.
Tohsaka urges me to go to the next place, I respond reluctantly, and Saber quietly watches over us.

...It was really fun.
The town I only used to walk by...
I didn't know all the things I didn't involve myself in were so meaningful.


As soon as I think so, something like a cage falls on me, and I understand.
I don't deserve this.
I'm unworthy of all this.
It tells me so from deep down within me.

I-I'm tired.
I never expected to play five games, with thirty balls each game, for a total of 150 swings.
It's all because...

"W-What is it, Shirou? It is troubling if you look at me like that."
...She hated losing.

"That was a miscalculation... I didn't think Saber would be so concerned about winning."
Tohsaka sighs next to me.
She also...

"Oh, I'll only play one game. My hands will get rough if I swing the bat too much."
...Said something like that, but ended up playing another game with Saber, and ended up complaining afterwards about how her shoulders and hands were tired.

"What are you saying? You only played twice. I played five times. And with the fastest speed too!
 ...Man. Saber would get mad if I went easy and sulk if I beat her too bad. It was a hellish hour."

"I-I did not sulk! I was only filled with spirit. First of all, this is nothing compared to the fights in the dojo. It is your fault for getting that tired."

"I get it. Saber's one that gets mad when she gets beaten in games, huh?"
I sigh and wobble on.

So here's what I found out today. One, do not gamble with Saber.
Two, a rule where the winner is the one to have ten more hits than the opponent can end up in an infinite hell if the ones playing are at about the same level.
And lastly, Saber is physically weaker than us if she does not use her magical energy.

...Or rather, is Tohsaka the strange one for hitting back 120kmph balls like nothing?
It's natural since Saber is the smallest one out of all of us, but I guess Tohsaka is rather strong for a girl.

"How rude. Batting doesn't equal strength.
 Even a girl can hit if the swing speed and the angles are right."

"Well, that's for one or two pitches. The problem is after that. Your arm would usually cramp up. Do you do push-ups or something before you go to bed? That's the only reason I can think of."
My voice is heavy with sarcasm.
But.

"...I-I do. What? Is that bad?"
"Uh, no. ...Nice."
She replies like that, so I'm the one that gets beat.

"L-Let's have lunch. It's past two already. I'm starting to get dizzy since I haven't eaten."
A family restaurant by the bridge should be a good place around here.
There are lots of choices on the menu, so I'm sure Saber won't complain.

"Is that fine with you, Tohsaka? It's not like you had a plan on where to go eat, right?"
I call out to Tohsaka.

"I-I do have a plan. I have it all planned out."
"Oh, okay. So where is this place you want to go to?"

"......Here."
"Huh? What do you mean by that?"
"I mean here. It's so sunny out, so we're gonna eat here in the park."

...I look around.
I don't see any cafe, nor even a hotdog stand.

"Tohsaka. Don't tell me you're going to get delivery or something."
"...Hey now. What do you think is in that tote bag you've been carrying all this time?"
"Huh?"

Oh.
Come to think of it, she did hand me a bag to carry this morning.

"...Hm. This kind of smells like mustard. So this must be..."
"It's lunch, of course. Didn't I tell you that I prepared some?"

She glares at me.
...I think she did say something like that.

"Wow, I'm surprised. I didn't think you would put so much effort into this."

"Of course I would. I invited you, so I prepared accordingly."

"Oh, the mystery's solved now. You used the bread for this, huh?
 I thought you ate it because you got hungry at night. It sounds like too much to eat a whole loaf, but I thought it might be possible in your case."

Wow, everything's solved now.
There are no more worries on my chest now.
"Oh."
When I look back up, Tohsaka is making a scary face.

"Emiya-kun?"
"Y-Yes? What is it, Tohsaka?"

"Can you stop talking and start preparing for lunch? Everything's in that tote bag. Oh, and I'll kill you if you're too slow."
"Ohyes, I'll do my best."

I quickly make a space on the grass.
...Man, that was scary.
It's bad for my heart to have her say something that doesn't sound like a joke with that big smile...

So.
Lunch starts two hours late.

"Oh, what's wrong, Shirou? Why are you spaced out?
 ...Oh, do you hate spicy food?"
She's right next to me.
Tohsaka says so from a close distance.
"Ehno, it's fine. It's really strong, but this is good."
I say so and take another bite.

"Really? That's good. It's a talent to be able to make a bad sandwich, right? I thought for a second I got that useless talent."
Tohsaka laughs.


If I looked spaced out, it's probably because she's dazzling to my eyes.

We're eating lunch on the grass under the clear blue sky.
This is peaceful enough, but it's too much once Tohsaka's added to the picture, and my nervousness is returning.

"Oh, you have a piece of tomato on your lip. Should I get it off for you?"
"Bu...! W-W-W-W-W-What are you saying!? I can do it myself!"
I wipe my mouth with my sleeve.

"Oh."
...Crap.
I got a red stain on my sleeve now.

"Geez, I guess I played around too much. I'm sorry, it was too funny because you gave me the exact reaction I wanted."

Tohsaka hands me a napkin. I don't know if she's laughing or apologizing.

"Heh. I don't care. It's been like this all day today."
I take the napkin and wipe my sleeve with it.
The red stain isn't coming out.
...Hm. Looks like Tohsaka's using some original sauce.
The stain is in there and doesn't look like it'll come out easily.

"But just you watch. I'm going to learn from today's experience and be less perturbed starting tomorrow. Don't think it'll go your way forever."

"Oh. Does that mean I don't have to hold back starting tomorrow?
 That's good. I was getting bored with putting a mask on."
The red devil smiles back.

"...Uh, I take that back. It'll take some time, so it'll help me if you keep it as it is now."

"Really? If you say so. But tell me when you want me to go to the next level, okay? I'll knock you out without reservation."

"Damn. I'll get you someday."
I'm not making excuses, but it sounds like an excuse.
...It's somehow really vexing, so I decide to take it out on the sandwich in front of me.

I eat the sandwiches.
I was hungry and it's Tohsaka's handmade meal, so I'm going to eat all of it myself.
...Well, actually, Saber already ate about a third of it.

So Saber and I munch down the sandwiches.
Tohsaka must be full, as she just stares at us.

"Your body seems to be doing well. I guess I don't have to hold back in the afternoon."

She makes an evil smile again.
It's that smile.
She's more looking forward to seeing me worn out then what she's actually going to do.

"Heh, don't take me too lightly. I won't be exhausted just by having you pull me around. With yesterday aside, I've been doing well all day today."

"I see. Then I guess you're all right."
Tohsaka sighs with relief and reaches out for a sandwich.
It's as if she's saying her burden's gone now.

"......?"
The moment I wonder why she said that...
"Oh."
Everything fits together.


Come to think of it, it was really unnatural.
The reason Tohsaka came to my house...
Archer knew about my body.
He must have heard that I projected his swords and knew that there's something wrong with my body.

That's fine.
But Archer, the one who wasn't there at that time, knew about the projection because Tohsaka told him about it.
Then.
As Tohsaka told Archer about our battle against Caster, wouldn't Archer tell Tohsaka about the penalty on my body?

"Tohsaka."
"Uh, what?"
"Why did you come to my house yesterday? And it's strange for you to stay over. I didn't notice all this yesterday because of Fuji-Nee."


A brief moment.
But I hear Tohsaka gasp.

"I don't have a reason. It was just a whim. I thought that it might be fun once in a while."
"I see. It was certainly fun last night."
"Right?"
"Yeah. But thank you."

"!"
Wow.
She turned red in an instant.

"W-W-W-W-What are you thinking...!? I-I wasn't concerned about you!"
"I know, it's not good to have your ally die. That's why you came to check up on me, right?"

"Uh... T-That's right. You're pretty smart."
"Yeah. But I'm still thankful.
 I don't know what your intentions were, but I'm sure you cared for me."

"......"
She groans in dissatisfaction.
Her gesture's so cute that it makes me smile.

"I see, I get it."
I kind of understand now how Tohsaka feels.
It feels really great embarrassing someone you like.

The weather changes once we finish lunch.
The sky is filled with clouds, and it looks like it could start raining any moment now.

"...I guess it can't be helped. We don't have any umbrellas, so let's go home."
There's no objection.
It's Tohsaka who started this, so it's her duty to finish it as well.

I nod.
I mentally apologize to Tohsaka, who is staring at me, and obey Caster.

"
!"
Saber looks away at my choice.

"......"
Tohsaka doesn't say anything.
We promised to beat Caster together, but she doesn't yell at me and just bites her lip.

"That's a smart decision, boy. That is what I expect from a Master chosen by the Holy Grail. This is a battle you have no chance of winning. It is best for you to obey me."

...Caster raises her arm.
The fingers that were grabbing Fuji-Nee's neck go for my heart.

"Hold on. Promise me one thing before you do as you wish."
"......Fine. It doesn't seem like you understand your position, but I will listen. What compensation do you want, boy?"

"...It's Tohsaka. You sound like you want to kill Tohsaka. Promise me you will not lay a hand on her until she gets home."
"Shirou."

Caster doesn't answer.
The purple-robed figure stares at me without moving, and...

"Fuhfufu, ahahahahahahahaha!
 I was wondering what you would say, but you obeyed me for such a thing!? That is wonderful, boy! How many years has it been since I laughed so hard...!?"

"...What's so funny, Caster?
 It's a stupid condition all right, but you have no right to laugh at Shirou."

"Yes, you're right, little lady. You are the only one that can laugh at him. That is why this condition is acceptable.
 All right. I was going to kill her here, but I shall make an exception and let her live. It is a wish of my ally. It is sad if I don't grant it."

The magus laughs.
Glaring at her, Tohsaka slowly retreats.

"Tohsaka."
"Goodbye. It was going to end up like this anyway. We'll be enemies next time we meet, Emiya-kun."
...I hear her leaving footsteps
Before they disappear...

"Wellthe farce ends here, boy."
...The magus's finger cuts out my mind.

...I'm in a deep darkness.
I don't know how many hours have passed.
I'm trying to count to keep track of time, but I can't think of any number above ten.
...Everything is vague.
I don't feel my limbs, and it's calm as if I'm floating on water.
Algae must have filled up my skull, and I want to laugh at this darkness.
"......"
Saber looks away every time I see her.
I think we obtained the Holy Grail quite some time ago.
But she doesn't seem happy at all, and she repeats "I am sorry" every time I see her.
"How do you feel, Shirou? We obtained the Holy Grail thanks to you. Tell me if there's anything you want. I can create anything for you, even if it is Saber or that girl."
...Something I want, something I want...
Nothing comes to mind. I've never wanted anything, and even if I did want something, it does me no good now.
If anything, I want a colder place.
A deep darkness that will freeze the algae in my skull and make me want to start dancing.
"Long time no see, Emiya-kun. I finally found you."
I hear a familiar voice.

"Caster was right. You were turned into that to let me go. So I'm the only one who can laugh at you."

I try to raise my hand to greet her, but I can't find my hand.
I recall an embryo in a test tube.
I'm floating in water.
I don't feel my limbs.

"I'll laugh it off.
         The bad dream ends here, Shirou."

Oh, the water's flowing out.
My floating body rolls on the ground.
A warm darkness that washes out the algae in my skull and makes me want to go crazy...
I'm curious as to why there's no reply, but Tohsaka might be one of those rare people who sleep with earplugs on.
...Well, knowing her, she might be sleeping because she stayed up late last night for unknown reasons. I guess I can let her be.

"Yeah..... First of all, you can't go into a girl's room without permission, you idiot."

I scratch my head and walk away from the forbidden door.
...That was meaningless.
It's not too late, so I'll go to the shopping district and buy some tofu.
I head to the tofu shop under the clear blue sky.
I buy three tofu with the 300 yen that was on the table.
"Oh, Shirou-kun. Great for you to come even on a Sunday!"
I go home drinking the soy milk I got as a service from the tofu shop owner.

"Yeah, this is great."
This is perfect.
This is a perfect morning with nothing to complain about.

"...But I feel like I'm at a loss..."
I tilt my head in wonder and look up at the sky.
A big serving of tofu and a 60-yen soy milk.
I don't think good things like this happen that often.

I slowly walked back and pondered what to do with the tofu for about twenty minutes.
It's eight-thirty already.

"Good morning, Shirou. You are at ease this morning."

"Hm? Oh, morning, Saber. I can relax since it's Sunday and there's no school today. I feel good, so let's go to the dojo after breakfast."
"Yes, that will be great. So your numbness has healed?"

"Oh, you're right.
 I was able to walk from the shopping district without a problem, so I guess it's pretty much healed. ...It's a bit heavy, but it should be fully healed by tomorrow."

"That is good. I cannot be at ease if my Master is wounded. I can relax if I see you in the kitchen like always."

Saber takes a seat in her usual position beside the table.
Fuji-Nee and Tohsaka are sleeping, but since it's Sunday, I should let them sleep in until breakfast's ready.

"Good morning, Rin. It seems you were able to sleep well last night."
Oh.
It seems Tohsaka's awake.

"...Morning. It wasn't really like that. The light was bright and there were people moving about even past midnight."
...Tohsaka answers Saber as she goes into the living room.

Well.
I don't want to complain so early in the morning, but I have to know why she took all of the bread.

"Good morning, Tohsaka. So, about"
My breath stops.
Tohsaka is wearing something unfamiliar again.

"Ahum..."
My heart starts beating rapidly.
...It's because of the red clothes.
It hurts my eyes so much that everything I wanted to say escapes my mind.

"I'm cooking breakfast. Have some tea while you're waiting."
I put the cups in front of Saber and Tohsaka.
But.

"Why are you so slow? We're going out today, so get ready quickly."
Tohsaka glares at me as if breakfast can come later.

"Huh? Um, where are we going?"
"To the neighboring town. I want to go somewhere far away, but we don't have such time, right? So it's a compromise."

"...?"
Is this some sort of new surprise attack?
I don't get what Tohsaka wants.

"Okay. I get it, but why are we going there?"
"We're going to go have fun, of course. It's a date."

"Datewho and who?"
"Shirou and I."
She declares naturally.
"?"
After tilting my head in wonder...

"D-DATE, ME AND TOHSAKAAAA!?"
"Who else is there? I told you last night, right?"

Hold on.
It's so sudden that my mind hasn't caught up yet...!!

"Come on, let's go. I knew this was likely to happen, so I made some lunch. Here, follow me and carry this tote bag."
She hands me a green tote bag and leaves the living room.


I stare after her, dumbfounded.
"Shirou...? Should you not follow her?"
"Ohhold on, Tohsaka!"
I quickly start running.
I hear another set of footsteps.
It seems Saber is following me.

"You're late. You have some nerve, making a girl wait."
I'm not that carefree at all.
She doesn't hear me out and it seems determined that we're going on a date.

"Wait, hold on...! Why are we going!?"
"Because I feel like it. You don't mind, right? We're not doing anything during daytime anyways. I won't let you run away now."

"I certainly don't mind, butyeah, what about Archer!? I bet he's against this!"

"I left Archer. I bet he's sleeping at my house right now."


I freeze.
...I can't beat her.
I can't talk Tohsaka down by myself.
If anyone can stop her, um

"That's right, Saber! What about Saber!?"
"Saber can come along as well."
Defeated.
All my cards are trumped in just one sentence.

"Have you accepted it now? Then let's hurry. We're going to forget we're Masters today and play our hearts out."
"Huhhold on, you idiot...!"
There's no time to be confused.
Tohsaka grabs my hand and runs out the door.

".........!"
...I guess I have to give up.
Tohsaka is so energetic that I don't think I can beat her, and I'm sure she'll defeat me in an argument even if I say something. And I don't know why, but Saber is following us without complaint.
...Well, that's good.
Um, see, it's really sunny today.
It is a quiet night.
The wind blowing on the mountain is gentle, and the rustling of the trees is as quiet as a whisper.
There are no birds singing about winter, nor are there beasts howling at the moon.
The only path leading to the Ryudou Temple...
The long stone steps preserve its peacefulness tonight as well.

But others do not know.
This place has withstood five battles already, each one was a great clash.
Many Servants challenged the Ryudou Temple.
Berserker, Lancer, Rider, Saber, Archer.
This mountain gate is able to enjoy the darkness thanks to the monster that has repelled all five enemies.

The longsword moves.
It is fortunate that the moon is not out.
The arc of the sword moving in a crescent-moon shape is so beautiful that the moon would be ashamed of itself if it saw it.

"Are you listening, Assassin? I told you that you will continue to guard the gate."
He ignores the magus in purple, Caster.
Assassin lowers his longsword and glances at the mountain forest without interest.
"Well, there was an intruder. I saw a strange bird, so I cut it. But it did not spill blood nor scream. Is this one of yours, Caster?"

"......! ...I see, this must have been a familiar spying on us. It must be Berserker's Master or that young lady. Either way, this place will not last long."
Caster walks to the forest and looks down at the "thing" on the ground.
It is the corpse of an owl.
It is a bird made from crystal. It is simple, but suited for spying, and must have been made by Archer's Master.

"...Heh, that lady is unlucky. I could have made her my student if she were less talented."
She steps on it.
The amethyst crystals are crushed to powder, scattering star-like dust.

"There are people like this, so I leave you in charge to protect my Master. I will disappear if my Master dies. If that happens, you cannot exist either.
 If you do not want to disappear, protect the gate and be prepared even for death."

"Wellit is hard to be prepared for death. I have never felt that I was 'alive'.
 Is it not meaningless to ask that of one such as I?"
"Stop your impudent talk.
 Do not misunderstand, Assassin. You are a Servant I summoned. A slave should act like a slave.
 If you cannot swear your loyalty, you can disappear right now."

Caster's words are filled with enmity and contempt.
For her, Assassin is only a tool.
It is annoying for a tool to talk, so it is natural for her to get mad when it starts to speak cynically.

"I see. Good heavens. My life is like a heat haze, but it is problematic if I disappear now. I have made a promise. If I can, I would like to fulfill this promise."
"Then hold your tongue. You only need to protect this place.
 If you're able to do so, I can make you real. A low-class like you without a Noble Phantasm can become a heroic spirit, so it should be worth risking your life, right?"

"You do not need to worry. I have belonged to the other world from the beginning. I will act out my role.
 But is it all right, Caster? I am not loyal to my master, but you are dishonest as well. Tonight's matter is a secret to your Master, right?"
At that instant, Assassin's body explodes.
A thumping sound.
The curse that was put into his body upon summoning has exploded.

The trees sway.
Assassin is flung into the forest, his chest pierced from within by his own ribs.
His figure is like a bloomed flower.

"Guhgeez. You are getting worse every day, Caster."
"Quiet. If I have to tell you one more time, I will eliminate you before waiting five days."
"...Geez. They say women and mean people are unmanageable, but you have gone too far."

The flashy Servant gets up.
This Servant does not lose his elegance even if he shows his ribs or if his body is covered in blood.

"Oh, do not glare at me like that. You are wasting your beautiful face, Caster. I know, everything is to be a secret from your Master, right? I will hide the fact that you caught Saber and that I am guarding this place.
 It is a moving story. I wish that your caring spirit would reach him."
"
Assassin, you..."

"I am just being a poor loser. I cannot attack you, so allow me to joke around like that.
 I will protect the gate. I will protect it no matter what.
 But where are you going? Do you not trust my protection?"

"Of course not. You're just insurance.
 But that's at an end as well. Once I have control of Saber, I don't have to use this rustic place as my temple."
"...Hm, so you will relocate? Then I am certainly not needed. Is there a sacred ground superior to this place?"
"Yes. It is inferior to this place, but there is a place suited for me. AndI will be going there in the near future anyways. There is no problem if I go now, right?"


Assassin's expression, which had been cool up to now, clouds up.
Caster smiles as if she's satisfied.

"Yes. Our victory is certain, so I'm going to go receive the prize ahead of time.
 A new territory and the Holy Grail. And I also have another piece called Saber. With all this, I am sure my uninterested Master would have no complaints with my policy."

That is true.
No matter how much Caster's Master, Kuzuki Souichirou, stays silent, he would be forced to fight if the conditions are set so perfectly.
But what is more certain is that...

"The boring war will end. There will be nothing to fear once I obtain the Holy Grail.
 ...Yes, nobody would be able to stop me!"

Loud laughter pollutes the night.
The magus in purple expresses her victory.
The knight with the longsword looks up at the sky.

The time is near.
No matter what the end may be, only five days remain.
Even though the remaining time will not likely be used up, the swordsman that has lived through hell feels that the match will not be settled easily.
"Ha, haa, haa"
And I fall.
I can't even breathe properly.
The wound on my shoulder is swelling up, and it hurts just to breathe.


I can't keep my consciousness.
I'll fall asleep if I let my guard down.
...No, first of all, I'm not too sure if I'm conscious or not.
I don't know how I got home from that rooftop nor why I came home.

...My thoughts become vague.
The only sure thing is my thumping heart.


...Tohsaka told me to not involve myself.
Because I'm powerless and I don't have a reason to fight anymore.


But that's wrong.
I knew more than anyone that I'm powerless.
My reason to fight is something different.

...I can't let it become just a scar.
Losing against others is inevitable.
I'm used to being beat up, and it's vexing, but I know I can't reach them no matter what I do.

But that's only when my enemy is someone else.
I can't lose against myself.
There's no element that would make me lose if our powers are equal.
To admit defeat against such an enemy is to declare that I'm wrong.

"!"
The wound distorts.
Blood stains the bandage.

"Ah, !"
I grab it with my left hand and glare at the darkness.
The memory from ten years ago...
The words of the man who was my father...

...Even if I was wrong from the start, there is nothing wrong with the path I took.
I wanted to be a superhero so that incident wouldn't just become a sad memory.
A time where everyone would be happy and shed no tears.
I have held that ideal for ten years.

"
Then..."
It doesn't matter how badly my head refuses to function.
What needs to be done is determined from the start.
I didn't fight because I became a Master.
I decided to fight because it's something I can do, and I believed it's something I have to do.
I finally remember the obvious.

"Tohsaka, no matter how much you tell me..."
If I believe it is right, I will believe in this path until the very end.
I won't stop, and I won't let her fight by herself.

...That's why I will sleep now.
I won't let her call me a burden.
I'll heal this wound up in one night.
And when I wake up in the morning

...And when I wake up in the morning...
I'll catch up to her for sure and repay her for what she did that night
The sun sets.
The sun, which wasn't even visible, sets and the dark sky gets even darker.

"I see. So Saber got taken away."
That's the only response Archer gave.
His master, Tohsaka Rin, simply stated the facts, but he states it even more matter-of-factly.

"...That's all? There are two Servants under Caster now. Don't you have anything else to say?"
"I cannot think of a way to beat her at the moment. But we should consider it fortunate that we know her Noble Phantasm now.
 Break the contract between the Servant and the Master, huh? We should be able to do better if we know that ahead of time."
"That is true.
 ...But you sure sound uninterested, Archer. Weren't you supporting Saber?"

"I don't think I ever showed interest in her. What makes you think so, Rin?"
"Let's see. Would woman's intuition be a good enough reason?"
"No. You are not of an age to be called a woman. First of all, you do not have enough charm.
 You lack elegance as well.
 And most of allyes, this is fatal... your charm is hard to understand."

"Heh. I see. You're finally back to par now."
She smiles pleasantly.
Archer has to be like this.
An unemotional person isn't the partner Rin trusts.
Her partner has to always be composed and has to speak cynically against anyone.

Rin knows that is the kindness of this knight.
Speaking cynically is like indirectly telling others to fix that part of them.

"I see. Then here's the first proof.
 You went easy on Saber the first time you met her.
 Even though Saber may be strong, I don't think you, the one good at defending, would be beaten in one blow."

"That was a surprise attack. I am weak against unexpected things, like you are."
"Heh, shut up. So, here's the next proof.
 You provoked Saber after the incident with Rider.
 That wasn't like you at all.
 I realized after I looked at it from a different angle. You were scolding Saber back then, right?"

"............"
"Oh, am I right? I thought so. I don't know if you knew her from your previous life, but it's rare for you to act so coldly."
"Really? I think I act that way towards everyone."
"You're the only one who thinks so. I think you're really clumsy when it comes to anything that concerns you. Everyone's tricked because you're not clumsy towards others."

Archer frowns.
He must have been self-conscious of it.
The knight in red ponders with a troubled expression, and his master looks at him in pleasure.
And suddenly...
"So, do you remember which hero you are now? If you're related to Saber, you must be a hero from around that age, right?"
She says so as if testing something.

"No, my past is still hazy.
 But I do remember Saber as you say. She doesn't seem to know me, so I guess we didn't have a deep connection."
"Hm. So I guess you two weren't friends or lovers.
 That's too bad. I would've found out Saber's true identity if that were the case."
She doesn't sound disappointed.
It's just an offhanded remark.

"Well, I'll remember eventually.
 By the way, Rin. How is the one you brought here doing? Is that one doing fine?"

"...Yeah, he survived. His wounds healed up automatically until yesterday, but this wound isn't healing at all. I think Saber's self-healing powers went away because the contract came to an end.
 But he survived. Fortunately, he didn't get hit in any vital points, so he should be able to get up and eat in about three days."

"No, not that one. I meant the other person."
"Huh? Oh, Fujimura-Sensei? I let her sleep in the guest room. I think Caster used a sleeping magic on her, but she's still doing really well. I did treat her, so it shouldn't be a problem even if she sleeps for a week."

"I see. But she might turn into a sleeping beauty with Caster's magic. That woman's spells are more like curses. The simplest way to dispel her is to kill Caster."
"Yeah. Either way, the Holy Grail War won't last much longer. We're going to beat Caster as fast as possible, and knowing Fujimura-Sensei, she might wake up on her own."
Archer nods.
And after a brief pause in the conversation...

"Beating Caster comes first. Even though there is one less Master now, Saber still exists. ...We do not have time to spare, Rin."
"I know. We'll go out to town immediately.
 Even Caster should take some time to completely control Saber. If possible, we have to beat Caster before Saber is fully controlled."

"All right. So the contract about that kid ends here, huh?"
"Huh?"
"Emiya Shirou isn't a Master anymore, right?
 Then he will be of no help and there will be no need to protect him. The second Command Spell can be lifted off me now, right?"

"What? Don't tell me you'll take care of him because he cooperated with you."
"Of course not. I'm not that good a person."

"Then..."
"But it's not over yet. I won't break the promise until he himself says he's out of this war.
 ...I'll try to get him out, but we can't end it until he gives up."
She declares stubbornly.
What can he reply to that?

"That's my course of action. Do you have any objections, Archer?"
"It cannot be helped. I'm fully aware that you are like that."
His voice sounds cynical.
She just laughs it off and makes an order.
"Let's go, Archer. I don't know why, but Caster isn't back at the Ryudou Temple.
 Thenlet's find her and defeat her before she goes back to the temple."
There's no need to answer.
The knight in red nods and follows his master.

Gloomy clouds are still overhead.
A moonless night. She departs with Archer to take aim at her target.
*Notice*
This Tiger Dojo is canceled because the instructor has been kidnapped.
Please look forward to the new series, "Magical Fuji-Nee, Magical Tiger".

I open my eyes.
My eyes are not the only things that wake up, as my sleeping mind wakes up as well.

"The wound isnot a problem."
I check the wound on my left shoulder.
It still hurts, but there's no intense pain like last night.
The heat in my body has gone away somewhat.
It shouldn't be a problem for me to move around.

I eat breakfast and satisfy my hunger.
Food comes before anything else. My body won't move unless it gets the nutrition it needs.

"All right."
I reapply the bandage.
The wound has turned dark blue.
It hasn't healed up, and I can see fresh red meat.

"Of course. Saber's not here."
I disinfect it, put gauze over it, and wrap bandages around it.
It's a primitive first-aid treatment to wrap and constrict the wound, but I have to do this so it won't get any worse.
"All done. I'll need a weapon now."

It's cloudy today.
It must be really cold, as there is frost on the grass outside.


But that's meaningless to me.
I feel no cold.
My body is burning and I want to pour ice water over myself.
But this is much better than the condition I was in last night.

The only things I can find are wooden swords.
I choose the one that looks like it is the best and put it into my shinai bag.

I slap my cheeks.
I don't know if it's to encourage myself or to reassure myself that I won't be coming back here.
I honestly don't know why I did that.

I carry the shinai bag over my right shoulder and head outside.
The place I've lived at for so long.
The shed was like my own room, but I don't turn to look at it.

Well, even though I've decided to fight, there are many problems.
I have to determine clearly what I should do first, or I'll probably end up not getting anything done.
There are two courses of action. I
I'll go find Tohsaka.
She told me to forfeit.
If I'm going to ignore her advice and fight, I have to make her realize...
That I'm not going to give up, and that we're still cooperating.
And

I can't let her fight by herself.
I owe her bigtime.
I can't forfeit until I repay her for that.

"...And she always screws up at the crucial moment... And she's so unreliable that I can't let her be alone."
I adjust the shinai bag on my shoulder.
...I know I won't be of much help and that she will object.
But I can't obtain peace of mind until I see Tohsaka's face.

...This is just a what-if...
But if she gets injured away from me, I can't even be there to help her

"Phew."
I sit down on a bench and rest my burning body.
It's past noon.
I've searched all around Shinto, but I haven't found anything.

"...Damn. I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but I didn't think I would find nothing."
I knew from the start that I had no way to find Tohsaka.
I let my luck take over and searched through the town, but I couldn't find her, nor any traces of her.

"...The other Masters aren't coming out either... I guess there's no need to attack me now that I don't have my Command Spell."
I sigh and lay back.


I'm making no progress like this.
Tohsaka hasn't left any trace, and my last resort of using myself as bait to lure out other Masters is failing so far.

...I get a bit uneasy.
I might not be able to find Tohsaka, and I might not be able to save Saber.
They might already be in a terrible situation by the time I find them

"It's still noon. I won't let that happen so easily."
I get back up.
I ignore the renewed throbbing in my shoulder and leave the park.

I'll search one more time.
I'm sure that she's in Shinto.
It's just like last night.
I don't know why, but I can feel that "he" is around here.
It's not something ambiguous like a premonition. This is a certain knowledge, like a conviction.
"It's useless. With so little power, you cannot run away from me no matter what you do."
Caster's voice echoes.
Where am Ino, what happened to my vision...!?

"Caster...!"
I swing my wooden sword in a world without any direction.
I don't feel it hitting anything and I don't hear the sound of its swing. I just use up my energy and worsen my wound.

"Do not worry. I won't kill you. You are valuable since you are rare. I shall rip off those annoying limbs of yours and use you as a wand for projection magic."
"Ah, gah."
My insides writhe.
My body won't even budge, but my insides are turning like laundry inside a dryer.
"...I'm surprised. Your body has not given up yet even though I have your mind. ...Fufu, I like you all the more now. Saber will soon be mine, so I will treat you gently like I will her."
"........."
The nausea that almost causes me to throw up my organs stops.
The magus in purple reaches out with her finger, wet with someone else's blood.
"That man got away, but I will not let you go.
 HereI shall let you see your beloved princess."
My vision is cut off.
I don't feel my limbs, and the only certain thing I feel is the pain in my shoulder.
But that ends quickly as well.
...I'll go to the church.
It's irritating to go ask that priest for help, but this is no situation to be caring about such a thing.

Even if meeting up with Tohsaka and getting her help may be the best course of action, I have no way of finding her.
But that priest might know where she is, and maybe even how to fight against Caster.

...My body feels heavy.
The wound on my shoulder aches and gets hotter with each step I take.

"...Gu... Haa... Haa... Ha"
...This small hill feels like a wall to me.
But it'll end soon.
I'll be relieved from this heaviness once I go up the hill and reach the church.

The church looks as if it were constructed near the sky.
...Blood is dripping down my chest.

"...Damn, my wound opened up..."
I don't think my weak will made the wound worse.
I should actually be resting.
So it's natural for my wound to open up if I push myself and move around.

"...But if I see Kotomine, even that will..."
He might not be able to treat me, but I'm sure he has some medicine.
His role is to protect Masters that are not able to fight anymore.
...This is ironic, but I am qualified to be under the church's care as I have lost my Command Spell.

".........Haa."
...Only a bit more until the church.
I'm worried about where Tohsaka may be and how Saber's doing, but I just want to sit down and cool my body for now.

The lights are out.
The church is silent.

"Kotomine?"
I don't see the priest.
...But I'm sure that he's here.
I feel a presence.
The church is not empty, as I hear sounds from deeper within.

"......Huh?"
Something's wrong.
What I feel and what I know are in conflict with each other.

"...Ah, hah..."
...I can't concentrate.
My wound is aching and I'm unable to judge what's wrong, what's happening, and what could be dangerous here.

"An earthquake?"
I stop myself before sitting down on the chair.
 A shelf might have come down, as I hear things breaking and Kotomine's voice.

"...So he's in the back."
It's dark in here.
Then today might be a day off for the church and the priest might just be in the back.
I don't know if the church has a day off, but I don't think it's accepting visitors, since the lights are off.

"And on a day like this?"
It's hard to keep walking with this wound, but I can't just sit down.
I have to go see the priest to have this wound treated and to find out where Tohsaka might be.

I emerge in the courtyard.
I couldn't tell from the outside, but it seems this building has a small plaza in the middle.
The hallway surrounding the garden is splendid and it reminds me of a monastery I read about

"Huh?"
I stop.
I think something that shouldn't be there was on the pillar right there

"Oh. I thought I'd see you again, but I didn't think it would be this soon."

"...!"
I turn around as I fall.
My feet are wobbling and I keep myself from falling by leaning against the wall.

"Why are you here...?"
I bear the pain in my shoulder and stare at the shadow in front of me.

"That is my line. I thought you wouldn't be able to move for a while with that wound, but you are much more resilient than I expected."
The purple robe comes closer.
I
Now's my chance.
It's not just a surprise attack.
Tohsaka and Archer, Caster and Kuzuki. If their powers are equal, even I can make a difference.

I can let Archer take care of Caster, so if I can stop Kuzuki for a while, Tohsaka can shoot him from a distance...!

"Shirou...!?"



I run down the stairs.
I have "strengthened" the wooden sword in my hand.
I suppress the pain in my shoulder.
I can't let Caster know that I'm wounded.

"Are you out of your mind...!? Why are you here...!?"
"What are you saying? You're the one who told me to go to the church.
 I didn't think I'd run into such a situation here either."

Tohsaka gasps.
Good. I said that on a whim, but it seems Tohsaka understands now.

"I'm going to help you. I should be of use in this situation, right?
 ...Complain to me after we defeat Caster."
I slowly close in on Kuzuki so that I'll be able to protect her.

"...You idiot. You and Rin would have survived if you had not come out."

"Huh?"
He mutters as if he's given up.
Before I realize what he means...
"Caster. This makes three against three. You should have no complaints. Get Saber."
Kuzuki uses his Command Spell to order Caster.

"Wha"
...Saber's bindings are released.
The golden-haired girl falls powerlessly
 to the ground and

"No way...!? Saber shouldn't be under her control yet...!"
"Yes. That's why I used the Command Spell and ordered her to kill you guys. It was my Master's order. I did not want to use it, but I had to, right?"

...Saber gets up.
Her body is covered with her silver armor, and in her hands is a golden sword I have never seen before

"...You got me, boy. I only have one Command Spell remaining now. This is for my protection, so I cannot order Saber by force anymore.
 ...My plan to make the Holy Grail eternal has been foiled. I can only make one wish come true now, but"

"I shall have fun here before that.
 Saber. Show them your true powers, as they have spoiled my wish."

Saber readies her golden sword and steps toward us.

"
"
Archer is silent.
Instead of telling Tohsaka to run, he stands in front of Saber.
It is...
...The final loyalty of the knight that understands he cannot protect his Master no matter what.

Saber and Caster begin their attack.
There's no way to counter-attack nor is there time to run away.
How can a mere human defend against it when even Archer has abandoned all hope?

Saber and Caster.
Ordered by the Command Spells, the two Servants attack mercilessly
"!"
I breathe quietly.
I push my body against the wall and watch while keeping myself hidden.
...It's still too early.
It'll be too reckless to charge in when I don't understand the situation yet.

And more than anything, I don't have much power.
The strengthened wooden sword is my only weapon. It's foolish to confront Caster without a plan.
No, that's wrong.
I do have another weapon.

"......No way. What am I thinking?"
I can't use projection.
Half my body became numb after I used it once.
Archer told me that it'll end up worse if I do it again.

Using magic beyond your capabilities can destroy you.
If I use projection magic in this state, it'll be natural for me to die on the spot.
"The chance will come. For now..."
I'll bide my time and wait for my chance.

"I see. So you killed Kirei?"
Her voice only holds murderous intent.
Tohsaka is glaring at the enemy with a coldness I've never seen before.

"Yes. He didn't seem like someone that would obediently hand me the Holy Grail. I also didn't want him to interrupt later on."
In contrast, Caster is calm and composed.
The magus in purple cheerfully admits the murder of the priest.


A gritting sound echoes through the temple.
...He was more like a devil than a saint to me, but that priest was a fellow apprentice to Tohsaka.
And he was killed.
Even though he was involved and might have been prepared for it, it's not something she can take in readily.

"...I see. That's fine. Kirei should have been prepared for such a thing. But Caster. Did you check his corpse?"

Am I mistaken, or has she suppressed all her anger? Tohsaka seems like she's not angry at all.
Caster evades Tohsaka's question.

"...What are you saying? Such a thing should not concern you."

"No, it doesn't. But it's not something totally unrelated to me. I just wanted to make sure, since I'll be relieved if he's really dead."
"What does that mean, little lady?"

"It means what it means, Caster.
 He's not one to die so easily. I just thought he might be alive, since you didn't check the corpse."

"Damn, you're useless. If you attacked Kirei, make sure you killed him.
 Oh well. I have something to do now, so let's finish this quickly, Caster. We can fight freely, as there are no hostages this time."

A signal to start.
Tohsaka or Caster...
If either one of them takes a step forward, this temple will be filled with magic

"You talk big. Do you think you can beat me in this situation?"

"It depends on how I do it. Fortunately, it seems Saber has yet to come under your control, so the conditions are the same.
 And I also know about Kuzuki-Sensei. Saber was surprised, but he's no threat to Archer if he knows his attacks beforehand."
Tohsaka points to Archer while staring at Caster.

"You heard it, Archer.
 I'll fight Caster. She might break your contract if you get too close to her."
"...Hm. So I will be fighting that man?
 I do not mind, butdo you know that a magus cannot beat Caster, Rin?"

"...Don't worry. I wouldn't say anything if I didn't have a chance of victory.
 I'll surely defeat Caster here. If I do that, Saber will be freed and Shirou can make a contract with her again, right?"
Tohsaka tenses for action.
I feel pressure as if she's a tiger about to attack its prey.

And as if to stop her...
"That is only in theory. It is difficult to defeat her here.
 She is a master when it comes to running away. She is a woman that will kill her own brother to escape."
Archer steps in between Tohsaka and Caster.

"Archer...? What are you doing?"

He does not answer Tohsaka.
The knight in red silently confronts Caster.

I think...
I saw something like this before...

"...I killed my own brother...?
 You talk like you know about me. Do you know my true identity?"

"I hear human-shaped creatures made of dragon's teeth are magic used by the king of Colchis.
 I hear that his daughter, Medea, was famed as an excellent witch."
The air freezes.
Caster's composure disappears and enmity like fire is directed at Archer.

"I see.
 Then you should know which one of us is at an advantage now, right?"

Archer does not answer.
His expression is like stone, as if accepting everything that is happening.

"Resistance is futile, Archer.
 You won't be able to take back Saber no matter who you may be. She still has a will to resist me, but that should not last for another day.
 AndI can make her into my puppet now if I use my Command Spell."


I barely stop myself from moving.
...Not yet.
Even if that's true, now's not the time.
If I want to save Saber, I can't jump out now

"Heh. Saber should be able to stand it even if you use the Command Spell. I don't know if it'll be a minute or two.
 But we should be able to beat you in that time."

"Yes, you are right. You look like you have some plan.
 But Archer, do you really think so? Do you think you can defeat me here like that girl thinks?"

Caster and Tohsaka are glaring at each other.
Standing in between them...

"That is impossible. Even if we attack you, all we would manage is to take half your powers at most.
 What awaits us after that is a disadvantageous situation where we would be fighting both you and Saber."
...Archer does not meet his Master's expectations.

"Archer, that's..."
"You should know, Rin. We cannot win if that happens.
 Saber's abilities were restricted because of her incomplete Master. As she does not have that restriction anymore, she is the strongest Servant now. Only Berserker should be able to match her."

He speaks plainly.
Tohsaka stares at Archer in astonishment, and even Caster is bewildered by the sensible enemy.

But it's different for me.
I've experienced something like this before.

"Could he...?"
I get a bad feeling.
Back at the Ryudou Temple...
When Caster proposed that he join her, what did he say back to her when he refused?

"Don't."
I murmur without realizing.
Don't do it.
It's not because the situation will get worse.
You're Tohsaka's partner.
So don't do it.
If you do such a thingI don't know what kind of an expression she'll make.

Archer steps forward.
He is empty-handed as usual.
He steps forward without enmity or intent to kill.

"Don't curse me, kid.
 There's nothing else I can do in a situation like this, right?"

He looks and smiles at me as if he knew I was watching this whole time

"Well, Caster. Let me ask you. Do you have room for one more Servant?"
"Archer, you...!"

"FuFufu, ahaha, ahahahahahahaha!"
Caster laughs out loud while Archer stands tall before her.
And Tohsaka...

...Takes this in with an expression I have never seen her wear.
She does not look away.
She should break down at a time like this, but she keeps a straight face and endures it, gritting her teeth.

"Of course. I have enough capacity to accept all the Servants. You know where I get my magical energy, right?"

Magical energy that allows her to maintain seven Servants.
It is the lives of the people in this town.

"Then this should be easy. I shall accept that earlier offer you made, Caster."
He holds out his hand to Caster in spite of that.


I feel like I'll go crazy.
I can't forgive him.
For betraying Tohsaka.
And for approving of Caster and joining Caster's side.

A hero.
For this hero, who embodies Emiya Shirou's ideals, to do such a thing

"Even though you refused back then? You are pretty unfaithful."

"The situation has changed.
 If Saber is on your side now, you are likely to win the Holy Grail War. It is natural to want to be on the winning side, right?"

Archer walks towards Caster defenselessly.
That means he's abandoning Tohsaka.
Tohsaka does not stop him and stares at her enemy.


I know that figure.
The red classroom.
She tried to hide her trembling legs and act like the same old Tohsaka Rin, even with the collapsed students in front of her.

...That's her strength and weakness.
She tries to act firm in any situation, so everybody around her gets the wrong idea that she's a strong person

"Use your contract breaker. Rin still has her Command Spell. I might attack you if you don't hurry."

His tone doesn't change.
He betrayed Tohsaka in front of her, but he's still acting normally.
She must be on guard against such a guy.
Caster takes out the distorted dagger, but she does not pierce Archer with it.

"What? You'll obtain a loyal subordinate without trouble.
 Why do you need to hesitate?"
"...Really? I do not trust betrayers. If your words are correct, then shouldn't Saber be enough for me?"

"You don't trust betrayers, huh?
 I certainly might betray you. I am going to your side for my own benefit. I did not approve of you as my master. But"

"The Command Spell is there to punish the betrayer, right?
 ...All right. I shall prove to the world that I am great enough to take you in. I am interested in your Noble Phantasm, so I will follow your plan."

Caster raises her arm.
The dagger to eliminate the contract pierces Archer's chest.

"!"
Tohsaka makes a pained face.
It must be the reaction of having her contract broken by force.
But this isn't the time to be hesitating.
This has become the worst possible situation.

Tohsaka watches Caster and slowly retreats.
...Tohsaka's calm.
She knows it'd do no good to fight them now.
If she wants to keep on fighting, she has to retreat for the moment.


But there are six meters between Tohsaka and the stairs.
Is it possible for her to run that distance safely?

Impossible.
It's apparent, watching the scene from above.
Kuzuki, who has been silent up to now, is on guard against Tohsaka.
If she turns and runs full-speed, would she be able to reach the stairs and get to the exit before Kuzuki catches up to her?

Tohsaka sighs while looking at them.
Her face...
"Hehthat's impossible."
...Seems to say so.


She'll die.
She'll be killed.
If I try to help her, I will also die.

The area below me is a land of death.
There is a Master called Kuzuki along with two enemy Servants.
There's no way I'd get out of there alive.


My throat is dry.
My fingers are tense from nervousness.
Zero or one?
Even before I can think...
Tohsaka moves.

She starts for the stairs without any warning.
Behind her...
A tall lean figure catches up to her so quickly that Tohsaka appears to be standing still.

Kuzuki's fist should hit her in the back of the head.
He was able to hurt Saber through her armor.
It should be easy for him to break a human skull.

I can't save her.
I can't save her by myself.
I can't save her with this wooden sword.

...I'll die if I go out.
I'll die if I go out.
I'll die if I go out.
I'll die if I go out.
I'll die if I go out!
I won't help her.
There's certain death waiting for me if I go help her.
If I'm human and if I'm alive, there's nothing else I can do.

But still.

"AhAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
My body does not stop.
I can't run away.
I'll die if I go out, but I'll live the rest of my life as a corpse if I run away here...!
"It's useless. With so little power, you cannot run away from me no matter what you do."
Caster's voice echoes.
Where am Ino, what happened to my vision...!?

"Caster...!"
I swing my wooden sword in a world without any direction.
I don't feel it hitting anything and I don't hear the sound of its swing. I just use up my energy and worsen my wound.

"Do not worry. I won't kill you. You are valuable since you are rare. I shall rip off those annoying limbs of yours and use you as a wand for projection magic."
"Ah, gah."
My insides writhe.
My body won't even budge, but my insides are turning like laundry inside a dryer.
"...I'm surprised. Your body has not given up yet even though I have your mind. ...Fufu, I like you all the more now. Saber will soon be mine, so I will treat you gently like I will her."
"........."
The nausea that almost causes me to throw up my organs stops.
The magus in purple reaches out with her finger, wet with someone else's blood.
"That man got away, but I will not let you go.
 HereI shall let you see your beloved princess."
My vision is cut off.
I don't feel my limbs, and the only certain thing I feel is the pain in my shoulder.
But that ends quickly as well.
"It's useless. With so little power, you cannot run away from me no matter what you do."
Caster's voice echoes.
Where am Ino, what happened to my vision...!?

"Caster...!"
I swing my wooden sword in a world without any direction.
I don't feel it hitting anything and I don't hear the sound of its swing. I just use up my energy and worsen my wound.

"Do not worry. I won't kill you. You are valuable since you are rare. I shall rip off those annoying limbs of yours and use you as a wand for projection magic."

The nausea that almost causes me to throw up my organs stops.
The magus in purple reaches out with her finger, wet with someone else's blood.
"That man got away, but I will not let you go.
 HereI shall let you see your beloved princess."
My vision is cut off.
I don't feel my limbs, and the only certain thing I feel is the pain in my shoulder.
But that ends quickly as well.
When did I figure out what the dream was?

A desert as far as I can see.
The numerous swords stuck in the ground do not have a wielder.
The sky is stormy and there is no forest, town, or sea within my sight.
A hill of blades stretching to infinity.
A graveyard of steel without any wielder or bearer.
I knew from the start...
That this is the scenery inside that hero's mind.

After many sequences of events, one who becomes a heroic spirit ends up in that place.

There are those who left the world loved by people, and there are those who left the world praised as noble kings.
There are those who died wanting to fight, and there are those who died in satisfaction.
...But it seems there are many that have been praised as heroes against their will.

If true heroes are those who have legitimately earned the title, these are a different kind.
They were forced to the throne of heroes because of their fate, and they should be called Avenger, the anti-hero.
They are the opposite of heroes, but they were praised as heroes regardless.
Even those that hated humans and those the humans hated are summoned as guardians.

...But he's neither.
He's not a true hero nor a rare anti-hero.
He was never compensated for his efforts and his own life ended with betrayal, but he never hated humans.
But it didn't last.
Yes, he probably grew weary.

I was mistaken.
Heroic spirits, familiars called Servants.
...Humanity's power to control called the "guardians".
They are summoned into every age to prevent humanity's extinction.
But the only condition for their summoning is "destruction brought on by humans".
Naturally, destruction brought on by an outside factor is solved not by human power, but by the world's restraining power.

...So the only thing guardian heroic spirits can see is self-destruction.
They are an existence that eliminate destruction brought on by human greed.
He made a contract with the world to save humans and became a hero.
After he died, he became a heroic spirit and was shown humanity's self-destruction over and over again.
He is summoned as a "heroic spirit" to save people, but he only gets to clean up after people's wrongdoings.

...It did not take long for him to realize that it is meaningless and start loathing the human world.
And in the end...
He was betrayed by the ideal that he protected unto death.

"Rin. Do you feel dizzy?"
"Huh?"
Hearing the call, Tohsaka Rin wakes up.
...She slowly looks around.
This is the foreigners' cemetery.
It's just past seven o'clock, but there is no one here.
Well, the hill with the church is always empty to start with.

"...Sorry, I fell asleep. I guess I'm tired."
"That is understandable. You have not slept since last night. Should we postpone this if you are not feeling well? We do not have to go get them right at this moment."
"...No, we can't take our time. Since we know where Caster is, we should settle this right now."
After saying so, Rin realizes that her body is warm.
Her familiar, Archer, must have kept her warm using his cloak.

"...Heh. You knew I was asleep, huh? And you didn't wake me up?"
"Well, it's rare to see someone sleeping while they are standing. I was fascinated, so I had to observe it."
"That's even worse. Who are you to be staring at a girl's sleeping face?"

"Do not worry. I have done nothing so rude.
 But I did hear something else. I can close my eyes, but I cannot close my ears."
"......I see. What was I saying, Archer?"
"I heard a few scary phrases, like how you're so angry."

"Oh, that's good."
Rin sighs with relief.
The dream she saw should not be discussed.
She can't have Archer know about it.
She likes their relationship.
...To maintain it, she has to hide the fact that she knows about Archer's past.

"Let's go, Archer. I know a bit about the church. I can guess where she might be hiding."
She brushes away Archer's cloak.
Archer silently protects from behind her.
Then...
"Hey, Archer. Have you ever regretted your own actions?"
She asks without turning around.


"I don't want to if I can help it. I want to grit my teeth and be stubborn, even when I'm completely beaten.
 But I'm sure that's hard. Harder than I imagine, I suppose."

"That would depend on the person.
 There are those who can and those who cannot do so. You are the former. Such people will not make mistakes, let alone consider them."

"...Hey. That sounds like I'm an arrogant tyrant."
"That is a good observation, Rin.
 A brilliant person shines brighter than others.
 Such people never have to grit their teeth.
 ...So. This is a personal opinion, but you would fall under that category. Tohsaka Rin will follow her path until the very end."

The knight in the red cloak praises her.
Rin blushes at his answer, but keeps asking without turning around.

"...Then what about you? Do you think you would be able to believe in yourself until the very end?"
"Hm? I'm sorry, but that question is meaningless."
"...Why? It's something you're able to answer, right?"
She sounds a bit nervous.

To that...
"The 'until the very end' part is meaningless.
 Did you forget, Master?
 I met my end a long time ago."
...The knight in red gives this reply.
The stone room is illuminated by the morning sun.
The light coming in from the ceiling pushes back the darkness.
Every entrance and every window is sealed off, but even that cannot block out the sunlight.
Even the place that should be covered in darkness benefits from the break of dawn.

    "Haaah"

Entrances and windows are ordinarily used to let things enter and leave.
The cracks cannot be covered, and besides, if it is entirely closed off, it cannot fulfill its duty to be used as a passage.
If one wants to completely shut out the light, there should not be any entrances.
If one prefers darkness, one should go to an underground place without a way to return.

    "Hm, ah"

In that regard, this underground temple is not perfect.
Light exposes all secrets without reservation.
The hidden temple was easily discovered, and its master was easily eliminated as well.
There are traces of blood on the floor.
The original owner of this temple was killed by an intruder.
The supervisor of the Holy Grail War, Kotomine Kirei, was removed from the stage by Caster's hand.

    "Kuh...... ah, hah......"

That battle happened a few hours ago.
The underground regained its silence.
The new master of the church is standing in the darkness.
But the winner scorns herself.
Caster glares at the darkness with an irritated look.

First of all, this temple is unpleasant.
Neither the sanctuary nor the secret sanctuary hidden beneath it suit her taste.
The intruding light is unpleasant, and the priest she killed was unpleasant as well.
And most importantly, the crucial objective has not been accomplished yet.
She is shocked at how poorly things are going, and she even considers reducing this whole place to ashes.

   "Fu, haa...... ah."

Fortunately, she refrains from such violence.
It is not because she regained her composure, nor is it because of respect towards the church.

She suppressed her emotion only because of this sound.
Faint, periodic sounds.
A woman's painful voice is like fine music to her.
She forgets her troubles and enjoys the spectacle.

   "Hm! Ah, haa, ah......!"

The groaning sounds of pain come from a girl.
The weak murmur contains heated arousal.
The groans would inspire either compassion or sadistic pleasure in those who may hear them.
It does not need to be said that she falls under the latter category.
Sweat drips down her forehead.
Just watching the beautiful lips, gasping in shame, seems to bring heat to this cold room.

"You are doing very well, Saber. I would never have expected you to resist the Command Spell for a whole night."
She talks with delight.

"HmHm, ah"
At the back of the temple...
The girl hangs, only able to moan.
As long as she opposes the Command Spell, free will does not exist for Saber.

Worse still, a magic so strong that it is visible tortures Saber's body.
The Command Spell pressures her from the inside and Caster's magic tortures her from the outside.
The torture is more unbearable than having her body wounded.

     "Ah, ahh, hm......!"

Saber's reasoning has already been melted away.
Only the last remnants of her pride hold her back.
Neither the Command Spell nor Caster's magic can take away that deep root.

Therefore, the torture continues forever.
Caster watches the processhow the girl desperately tries to hold her ground.
It was Caster that dressed her in this white costume.
It is not arousing with her armor, and most of all, the armor does not suit her.
If she is an untainted virgin, she should be in a pure white dress when she falls.

"...Fufu. How brave of you.
 No matter how much you resist with your will, that Servant body of yours is different.
 You can tell that the Command Spell is slowly infringing on your mind, right? You will be mine in less than a day. In that case, is it not easier to give up now and become mine?"

"Kuh, hm......!"
The voice protests painfully.
Even though her reasoning is melted, Saber does not yield to Caster.
As Caster says, she will endure this torture until the Command Spell fully controls her body.

"You are stubborn, Saber. ...But I shall forgive you.
 I like girls like you. That golden hair, small body, the boyish gallant figure, everything is so cute. And I love your loyalty for trying to choose death over betrayal.
 Really, I want to step on you and crush you."

She looks at the girl with eyes filled with joy and hatred.
If Caster put her mind to it, she could get Saber to surrender in an instant.
Saber's freedom is lost from fighting one Command Spell.
Then, the result is obvious if Caster uses a second Command Spell.
Saber will become Caster's without the need for such torture.

"Kuh... Haa, ah!"
But she will not do such an inelegant thing.
Caster should take time training her, since she is a lovely toy.
For Caster, Saber is a tool with first-class appearance and ability.
It is natural for her to savor this rare jewel.

"...Yes. It is boring to control your body using the Command Spell.
 I will have you become my Servant out of your own will. ...Yes, I will destroy your mind before your body."
Caster glares with bewitching eyes at the girl in the white dress.
She almost forgets about the Holy Grail. She thinks about Saber's white skin and imagines transforming her into a slave that only seeks pleasure.

She will make the girl into a tainted slave to her lusts.
She will not do something crude like taking her virginity.
She is a virgin.
Then she should make her into a virgin that drowns in pleasure.
A girl whose body will never be satisfied, greedily seeking pleasure...
When she imagines it and smiles...

"What are you doing there, Caster?"
An unemotional voice suddenly calls her from behind.

"!?"
She turns around immediately.
Above the temple...
Someone slowly comes down the stairs that lead outside.
A tall, lean figure appears from the darkness.
There is no sound of footsteps, nor is there any presence to be felt.
The man comes down into the temple and shows no emotion even after seeing the blood on the ground and the girl.

"Souichirou-sama."
Caster changes her attitude right away.
Her expression changes from one filled with joy and irritation to that of a tense Servant.

"Why are you here...? I believe I asked you to stay at the Ryudou Temple."
"I questioned you first, Caster. I asked you what you are doing here."

The manKuzuki Souichirou does not change the tone of his voice.
The flat voice is more terrifying than any threat.
A voice without emotion is like a mirror.
A guilty conscience.
The voice is more fearful to those with greater guilt.
One is questioned not by Kuzuki, but by one's own mind.

"!"
Caster holds her hands on her chest and reports to Kuzuki.
He is not one that can be fooled.
No, she cannot bear to tell a lie to this person.

"I have taken away a Servant last night from one of the Masters, Emiya Shirou. ...I let Emiya Shirou go, but he is no longer a Master. If he is smart, he should not oppose us anymore."

"I see. But I have not given such an order."
"I acted arbitrarily, Master.
 After that, I attacked the church to obtain the 'vessel' of the Holy Grail. I have killed the priest, the caretaker of the Holy Grail, but the Grail's whereabouts are unknown."
"That was your decision as well, huh? You must not have returned because you could not find the Holy Grail. ...Hm. But it is a place you obtained after much trouble. It would be meaningless to abandon it without finding what you are after."

Kuzuki's words are not criticizing her.
But Caster can only be ashamed of herself.
She killed the priest who knew where the Holy Grail was, but she still does not have the Holy Grail.
Furthermore, she has revealed her own action which should have been hidden from him. What else can she call it but a total failure?

"I understand the situation. Can you explain why you did this, Caster?"
"...I am sorry. But this is all for you, Master. My goal is to lead you to victory. I have no other reason."

A long silence.
After hearing Caster's declaration, Kuzuki Souichirou murmurs, "I see".

"Then I cannot move away from here. Your troubles will be for nothing if other Masters find the Holy Grail while we are absent."
"Then, Master..."
"You can search this place until you are satisfied. I shall remain here until you are done. You alone are not fit for fighting. You will need a guard until Saber is under your control."

"Huh? N-No, there is no need for that. I do not need your help, and I do not know how long the search will take.
 And this place is dangerous. You will be safer if you return to the Ryudou Temple."
"That is true. But if I do that, I cannot fulfill my objective."

"?"
Those words are unexpected even for Caster.
What kind of an objective does this man have, who has no interest even in the Holy Grail which can grant any wish?

"Souichirou-sama, then..."
"Hurry. I do not care if it is not here. Just make sure you come up with a clear result."
With that, Kuzuki goes back up the stairs.

Caster watches him go in blank amazement.
The dark room is still silent.
The footsteps going up the stairs still cannot be heard.

I open my eyes.
My eyes are not the only things that wake up, as my sleeping mind wakes up as well.

"The wound isnot a problem."
I check the wound on my left shoulder.
It still hurts, but there's no intense pain like last night.
The heat in my body has gone away somewhat.
It shouldn't be a problem for me to move around.

I eat breakfast and satisfy my hunger.
Food comes before anything else. My body won't move unless it gets the nutrition it needs.

"All right."
I reapply the bandage.
The wound has turned dark blue.
It hasn't healed up, and I can see fresh red meat.

"Of course. Saber's not here."
I disinfect it, put gauze over it, and wrap bandages around it.
It's a primitive first-aid treatment to wrap and constrict the wound, but I have to do this so it won't get any worse.
"All done. I'll need a weapon now."

It's cloudy today.
It must be really cold, as there is frost on the grass outside.


But that's meaningless to me.
I feel no cold.
My body is burning and I want to pour ice water over myself.
But this is much better than the condition I was in last night.

The only things I can find are wooden swords.
I choose the one that looks like it is the best and put it into my shinai bag.

I slap my cheeks.
I don't know if it's to encourage myself or to reassure myself that I won't be coming back here.
I honestly don't know why I did that.

I carry the shinai bag over my right shoulder and head outside.
The place I've lived at for so long.
The shed was like my own room, but I don't turn to look at it.

Well.
Even though I've decided to fight, there are many problems.
I have to determine clearly what I should do first, or I'll probably end up not getting anything done.
...There is only one course of action.
Hi, is everyone doing well?
This is the corner that helps the unfortunate people who get run over by trucks once they enter a shortcut, the Tiger Dojo!
......
Well. The cause of death this time is pure misfortune.
It's the correct choice to go to the church, but I recommend looking around for Tohsaka-san by yourself for a bit.
......
......Hey. Why are you frozen, Ilya-chan?
Did you mistakenly eat something spicy?
......
...Are you ignoring me?
That's rude. Answer me. No, keep me company. I'm feeling lonely.
Geez, shut up!!!!
Oh, you're awake now?
It's not "am I awake"!
I was frozen from shock! Fainted! Ectoplasm!
Why?
"Why"? What was that intro!?
What is that? Isn't this the Tiger Dojo? I don't get it at all!
A magical girl is like that, you know?
You don't know that, Ilya-chan?
Ahhhg!
That expression of pity irritates me!
First of all, are you of an age to be a magical girl!? Out of everybody in Fate, the only one suited to be a magical girl is me...
U-Umm... and Senpai!
Anyway, that intro won't be allowed in the future! The magical girl joke will not be allowed!
I see. You wanted to be a magical girl too, huh?
But I'm sorry. It's impossible. There are the right people for the right things, you know?

But I'll work something out for you. You're pretty evil inside, so I think you'll make a good enemy, like Germanburuma or General Tiger-

I-I won't play such a weird character!
Go to hell, you drunk tiger!
Kyaaa! A new rival appears?
Hello, everyone.
It is time for the counselor of life, time to resolve all your secret problems.
This is today's guest.
The one living in Ryudou Temple in Fuyuki City, Caster-san (Pseudonym), 28 years old (Estimated).
Hello. Please give me your best regards...
(The voice is changed for privacy reasons)
Oh my, you are beautiful.
What's wrong? Someone as beautiful as you shouldn't have any problems.

Um, well... I think I'm not standing out... People say I'm plain compared to the other six, not a good character, and that I'm too old...
Oh, that's terrible.
Oh, what is this? It says here that you are a fortune teller.
...Yes. I actually want to be a housewife and raise a warm family. I returned to work in hopes of decreasing the burden on my husband, but I'm getting tormented at work as well...
What should I do!? I want to change!
I want to be a more lovable character!
Haha, that's impossible!
During the development phase, it was said that "Caster turns into a loli with hyper power", but we only need one loli!
Give up your hope of being a cute character!
...Sigh. You're right. I kind of realized it, but it's just too painful...
I'm doing my best, you know? I secretly saved up, hired a guard, and set up surveillance cameras everywhere.
But my husband doesn't even thank me for my hard work! Just a while ago, my plan was foiled by these kids that suddenly appeared...
I'm working so hard, but I'm not getting compensated for it!
Fujimonta-san, can someone like me find happiness?
Nope.
It's your fault, Caster-san.
N-No way... Even here, they abuse me...?
All right, I'm bored with this now! The case is settled!
That is all for the life counseling by Fujimonta!


They aren't opponents that we can take on by ourselves.
There are three enemies.
Then we'll need at least one more on our side.

...Then there are limited possibilities.
People who are magi and have a reason to fight against Caster.
It'll be other Masters.

"Tohsaka, don't get mad and hear me out. Um, do you think it's feasible to cooperate with other Masters?"

"......All right, why do you say so? You must have a plan."
"Well, that's not the case, but Caster isn't someone the other Masters can just ignore, right?
 So I thought we might be able to cooperate just to beat Caster."

"...Yes. I was actually thinking of the same thing. I didn't say it because I thought you'd object."

She says so unenthusiastically.
She must not like the idea, but she must know that's the only option we have.

"Well, there are two remaining Masters now. Lancer's Master and Berserker's Master.
 There's no way to negotiate with Lancer's Master because his identity is unknown. But we might have a chance with Berserker's Master, Ilyasviel."

Berserker's Master.
The white girl and the statue-like giant I met on the night when it all began.
She sounded dangerous, but I don't think she's cruel.

"...Yeah. I think she would at least listen to us. I don't think she'll ask for much in return, either."

"You idiot. She's the most dangerous for you.
 She was only looking at you, Shirou. I don't know what she'll do to you."

"W-What do you mean? I've only met her once, so that can't be possible. Quit scaring me like that, Tohsaka."

"......Humph. We'll stop the negotiation right then if that does happen."
Then...
Tohsaka averts her gaze and gulps down her tea.

"...But we can only bet on Ilyasviel for now. If Archer is right about Caster's identity, Berserker would be her natural enemy.
 They knew each other when they were alive, so he should know Caster's tricks. Berserker can handle Caster and Archer by himself. We can take care of Kuzuki while he does so."

"That's an optimistic thought. But does Berserker really know Caster?"

"Yes, Archer told me that Berserker's true identity is Hercules.
 If Caster really is that witch, Berserker might know her through the Argo Expedition.
 It's just like how I don't get along with Kirei. Everyone has a natural enemy."

...Okay.
But I'm sure everyone would dislike that priest.

"Then it's decided.
 But how should we find her? She hasn't appeared since that night. We should be able to find her because of her large magical energy, right?
 But we can't find her in spite of that, so doesn't that mean she's not in this town?"

"I'd assume not. Ilyasviel must be having fun, watching the Holy Grail War from a faraway place."
"...Faraway place? Is she keeping watch over the town like how Caster was doing at the Ryudou Temple?"

"I don't know. But I have an idea of where she might be.
 ...I heard from my dad that the Einzbern family has a villa in the forest on the outskirts of town."

She says so with a tense voice.
A villa inside the forest...
Tohsaka's expression tells me how dangerous the place is.
The sun is setting.
We return to the hall when the sky turns red.

...The corpse of the girl is not on the mountain of rubble.
We just buried her in the courtyard.
I don't know if it's normal for Servants, but the black giant turned into sand. But we put the sand in the same coffin as the girl.

"Well. Do you have any ideas on what to do now?"
"...I'm still thinking. The situation just got worse. I can't think unless I get this sorted out."

"Yeah. ...The strongest enemy, Ilyasviel and Berserker, are gone, but an unknown foe came out in their place.
 There should only be seven Servants, but he makes eight, right? ...He's not a Servant that should exist. How did Shinji make a contract with such a guy?"

...An eighth Servant, huh?
I don't think we can treat that man as a Servant.
He is a heroic spirit that dominates all others.
He has a seemingly infinite supply of Noble Phantasms, and he is a devil without any human emotion.

"Gilgamesh. That's the hero appearing in a myth of ancient Mesopotamia, right?"

"Yeah. He's half-human, half-god. He is the king of Uruk, and the seeker of immortality. He is said to be the tyrant that obtained everything in this world, but I didn't think he was that crazy."

"...He defeated Berserker so easily, so he might be stronger than Saber even if she has her true powers released."
Tohsaka doesn't sound as sharp.
It doesn't seem like it's because there's a new enemy.

"...? What's wrong? You sound like you want to say something."

"Hm... well. He was certainly strong. He has so many Noble Phantasms, so he's powerful, right?
 But I'm wondering how it really is. I felt that there wasn't much difference between him and Berserker."

She ponders.
...Huh?
Could it be that Tohsaka doesn't know about his powers?

"No, he himself is about as strong as Saber or Berserker, if not weaker.
 First of all, heroic spirits are as strong as their fame in the place they're summoned, right? There aren't many people here that know about Gilgamesh."

"That's true, but the change in power from popularity isn't that big.
 It seemed to me like that goldie had an unfair advantage..."

"...?"
Tohsaka calls him by a strange name.
Well, with that aside.

"He did. All the Noble Phantasms he has are real. ...No, they are all originals of the real ones.
 Gilgamesh is a hero in the oldest myth, and he was a king that indulged in every possible luxury. Then it shouldn't be strange for him to own all the originals of the legendary weapons."

"Ohthen what? The Noble Phantasms he used weren't Noble Phantasms, but just weapons...?"

"I'd assume so. I bet his Noble Phantasm is his 'treasury'.
 I think his Noble Phantasm is the 'treasury' where he kept all the weapons he collected during his life."

"...I see. Then it's natural that Berserker couldn't beat him. Every heroic spirit has a weak point. If he has the originals of every Noble Phantasm, he just needs to take out the one that is the most effective against his enemy."

...That's right.
If there is a chance of victory, it is that he is not a master of these weapons.
He is not a "wielder" that has mastered his weapon to the limit, so I think there is still a way to beat him.
But with all that aside...

"Hey, Tohsaka. This has nothing to do with this, but why did you call him goldie?"
"Huh...!? Um, I guess... um, he had golden hair."

"What are you saying? You should have called Saber that if that's the case. It seemed like you said it with a lot of meaning behind it. I think you noticed something, right?"
"Huh?"

"Don't hide it now. You noticed something, right?"
"Y-You're wrong. It's nothing serious like you're thinking, so don't worry too much about it."

"Don't lie. You wouldn't call him goldie for nothing. Come on, Tohsaka. I want as much information as possible right now."
"UhUh."
I stare at Tohsaka.
After a few seconds...
She sighs as if she's given up.

"...Well... he had many valuable looking things, right? So I just thought he's really rich.
 ...That's why I called him goldie. He looks like he's living a luxurious life, right?"

Tohsaka scratches her cheek while looking away.
How scary.
It seems anyone who's rich is called goldie by Tohsaka.
What's more scary is that Tohsaka figured out the Servant's true nature just because he "seemed rich".

"Anyways, that's another troublesome guy. There's not supposed to be an eighth Servant, so he would be the Joker.
 ...I want to question Kirei as the supervisor, but I don't know his whereabouts.
 Well, we have to postpone that since Caster is more important right now."

...That's right.
Caster is obtaining more power as we speak.
Saber should not be able to oppose Caster's control much longer.
No.
In the worst case, Saber could already be under her control.

"Yeah.
 We couldn't get Ilyasviel's help, but that doesn't mean we can let them be. We'll just have to think of a way to beat Caster with the two of us."
"...Yeah. We don't have any ideas, but we'll have to."

She sighs and sits on the rubble.
"...Phew. I never thought we'd have a strategic meeting in a castle."
I follow Tohsaka's lead and sit down.

...Well, we'll have a bed to sleep in here.
If we're lucky, we might even find some magical item of Ilyasviel's.

And the moment we let our guard down...
"Get real. You're going to defeat them just by yourselves?
 That's impossible, you idiots."
A stunned voice comes from the front entrance.

"!?"
We jump up and turn to face the speaker.

"Since that night, huh? It's great you two are still hanging in there."
"LLancer...!?"

I quickly concentrate and connect my Magic Circuit.
He is certainly Lancer.
...He speared my heart on that night ten days ago.
I can't let it happen again.
I have to let Tohsaka escape before he attacks!

"Get away, Shirou...! I'll keep him busy, so you run to the second floor...!"
"Run, Tohsaka...! I'll hold him back, so you run outside!"

"Hold on.
 It seems you weren't listening to me at all when I told you to value your life."
She lowers the hand she pointed at Lancer and points at me.
But I have objections as well!

"Don't be stupid. I told you I won't heed your warning. It's a guy's role to fight hand-to-hand. This is the second time I'm fighting him, and I'm more suited for it."
"That can't be true! He's a foot soldier. How can I, the ranged attacker, run away from an enemy with no ranged weapons!?"

"That's why! Can't you tell you'll die if he closes in on you!? You can just back me up from a distance!"

"You idiot! I can't back you up! I don't know any magic that's that precise! I bet I'll blow you away along with him!"

"! Don't come out with your destructive personality!
 First of all, why do you always try to be flashy!? Try doing something modest for a change! I can understand Caster not wanting you now."
"W-What!?"

...And we argue for a few minutes.
When we begin to tire and wonder how this got started...
I notice that Lancer is watching us with a smile.

"Oh, you're done? I'm in no hurry, so finish it off. It's good to let out everything you have."


I cough and glare back at Lancer.
I take half a step forward, and Tohsaka is right behind me.
...Man, we should have done so from the start.

"Oh, hold on. I'm sorry to say this after you've reached a compromise, but I don't intend to fight. I was just unable to ignore you guys. I'm butting in so that I can help you guys a bit."

"What?"
Hold on.
What did he just say!?

"...Did I mishear you? I think I heard that you're helping us."

"Oh, is it hard to understand my point? I guess I'll rephrase it. You two are no match for Caster. So I will lend you guys a hand."

I'm stunned.
But Tohsaka quickly grasps the situation.

"I see. You really are butting in. Is that really your idea?"

"No, it's an order from my Master. He wants to cooperate against Caster since he's alone. Well, we're just making a quick alliance until we defeat Caster."

"That's a sound reason. But I think there's a more reliable guy to go talk to."

...Is she talking about Shinji and Gilgamesh?
It seems Tohsaka is trying to figure out if Lancer knows about them

"No, they won't do. I don't want to ally with them.
 I have no complaints about his power, but it's too troublesome to worry about my back when I'm fighting."
"...Oh. That's the correct choice, Lancer. Is that an order from your Master as well?"

"That's wrong as well. I chose you two out of personal interest. You guys are easier to talk to since we're acquaintances, right?"
He speaks plainly.
It seems that fighting Archer and driving his lance through my heart are the same as becoming acquaintances in his mind.

"...Hold on, Lancer. I was almost killed twice by you. And you think I'm going to believe you?"

"I do believe so. Your commander-in-chief is a good frank woman. Such a good woman is helping you out, so you must be good-natured as well, right?"

"Hm
"
I frown.
...I'm troubled that Tohsaka is nodding at our enemy's words.

"So that's it. That's why I thought we might be able to cooperate.
 Oh, but let me tell you. It's not 'you guys'. 'I'm' the one who thought that you guys would make good allies."
"......?"
I can't understand the difference.

"...Aren't you the cocky one? You brought on the proposal, but you're the one that's going to choose?"
"Yeah. I've liked you since the first time I saw you.
 You're beautiful, stubborn, and courageous. If I'm to have a female Master, I want someone like you."

Lancer looks at Tohsaka with cool eyes.
"...Humph."
...I don't like him for some reason.

"Fine. I'm up for it. But it's not decided yet.
 If Emiya-kun can't trust you, we have to break off negotiations."
"So, that's what she's saying. What will you do, kid? Your character is being tested."
 Lancer looks at me, trying to suppress his laughter.


My answer is

I restrain my body that wants to go out.
I see Tohsaka biting her lips.

...I know.
Tohsaka wants to stop him as well.
But we'll be the ones to be killed if we do so.
We can't stop him.

   The man's arm reaches out for the girl.

", , "
I can't breathe.
My feet are on fire from wanting to jump out.
My arms want to go over the terrace.
My body is shaking as if it broke down and it tries to go against my brain.

    It's as if I've gone crazy.

", , "
I kill my voice and kill my mind.
I kill the girl below me as if to kill myself.


And it ends.
The man pulls something out of the girl with a smile.
A red object that looks like a poisonous fruit.
The thing in the man's hand is the girl's heart.


My mind burns down.
My brain that has gone white shakes with violent anger.

"Oh? I smelled something bad, but I see, there was a fool that has been watching this spectacle, huh?"
With the girl's heart in his right hand...
"How insolent of you. A mere lowlife should not look directly at me...!"
He shoots off one of his numerous Noble Phantasms at me.

...We have to accept his offer.
Even if he's an enemy, he's still right.
Tohsaka and I can't beat Caster.
But we might have a chance if Lancer's with us.

"......All right. I'm also up for the alliance."
I turn off the Magic Circuit and relax.
That's the best sign of goodwill I can show him.
I won't be fighting him.
I'm showing him that I'll be trusting him with my back if we're fighting together.

"I see, this is seriously bad. No wonder you're going through so much trouble, young lady."
"Oh, you can tell? That's great. There's finally someone who understands. I was worried that things would stay like this to the very end."

"I feel for you. Still, he's not bad, as guys go.
 You can be stupid and foolish when you're a kid.
 You can learn stuff and get twisted after that."

With that, Lancer walks to us.
His red lance isn't in his hand.
Lancer has let his guard down, just like I did.

...We have to accept his offer.
Even if he's an enemy, he's still right.
Tohsaka and I can't beat Caster.
But we might have a chance if Lancer's with us.
But

"...All right. I'll believe you.
 But it'll be under one condition. I'll accept your help in defeating Caster, and we'll trust you.
 But"

"But what? You want me to tell you who my Master is?"
"No. Even though we're cooperating, stay away from Tohsaka."

The air freezes.
Lancer is speechless, like he's been sucker-punched.

"Hah, I see, I see! Yeah, that's so much more important than who my Master is! You're right, kid!"
He starts laughing heartily.

"Is that bad? I'm telling you that you can't have Tohsaka."
"That's not bad at all. Rather, I have a better opinion of you now.
 Wow, that's great, young lady. This kid's completely fallen for you!"

"! W-W-W-What are you saying!? We're not like that! Um... yes, we're just cooperating...!"
"Reeeally?"

"...! You're irritating. What's with that know-it-all face...!?
 Come on, say something, Shirou! Tell him we're just cooperating!"


..................

"Hey, say something, you idiot...!
 T-This is as if we really do love each other...!"

"Hey, it's not 'as if'. You two are already in love. Even I can tell, and I'm only watching it from the side. But she's actually denying it? This is troublesome, kid."
Lancer makes a sympathetic gesture.

"......Well. I already know Tohsaka's troublesome."
I dismiss his sympathy with a sour look.

"Wha-"
"Oh, how reassuring. Then I shall take care when I socialize with her.
 But she's fun to tease, so I'm going to entertain myself while we're together. You don't mind that condition, right?"

"...All right. We'll go with that. We'll have your help until we beat Caster."
"Then it's decided. Well, let's shake hands."

Lancer walks to me unarmed and shakes my hand.
There are worrying factors, but we're able to obtain a reliable ally.
All that's left is...

"I'm so mad!!!
 Fine, I'm breaking my ties with you guys!!! I'm going to go beat Caster by myself!!!!"
How can I calm her down...?
"I refuse. I can't trust you."
It's not only Lancer.
I don't want to go along with Lancer's Master, who is still unknown.

"I see. Your partner is saying so, but what about you, young lady? You said you'd go along with his choice."

"I won't take back my words. It's meaningless to cooperate with you if Emiya-kun can't trust you."
"I see, you're right... This is disappointing. You really were my type."

Lancer turns.
The blue figure does not look back and disappears in a flash.
We're back at my place.
I never thought I would make it back alive, so I relax once I get into the living room.
"Whoa."
I feel a bit dizzy and lean against the wall.

"See. You can't even stand up, you idiot."
"......Hm."

...She's right, but I think her last comment was unnecessary.
How many times did she call me an idiot today? I bet she set a new record already.

"Come over here. We have to replace those bandages at the very least."

I nod and move by Tohsaka.

"I can use this first aid kit, right? Oh, as expected from a house with a dojo.
 It's rare to see a first aid kit with needles and threads along with scissors... Hey, come on. Take off your shirt and show me your wound."

"EhI have to take my clothes off? Oh, no, I can do it myself. I treated myself this morning, so it shouldn't be a problem."

"...Come on. I don't know why you're so reserved, but who do you think treated that wound in the first place?"

"Ugh. But that was, um..."
I was unconscious and I was only causing trouble for Tohsaka at that time.

"Stop your whining and hurry up. Your wound is special, so we have to treat it right for it to heal up."

"......"
How unfair.
I can't complain if she tells me with a face like that.

"...Okay, I'll leave it to you. To be honest, it's burning right now."
I give up and sit down.
Seeing that the shirt is stained with blood, Tohsaka gives up taking it off and starts cutting it right away. She then quickly but carefully takes off the bandages.


...Is it that bad? Tohsaka gasps when she sees it.

"......"
...But I'm troubled as well.
It's so embarrassing having her stare at my body so closely.

"You really did push yourself. It was healing up, but the wound opened up again.
 ...Geez, I can't get mad at you if I see a wound like this."
She talks like that, but gently touches the wound.


...Crap, I'm getting dizzy for a different reason.
I was able to stay calm even if she was near me, but my heart's beating fast now and I'm having trouble determining where to look.

"......Man."
I criticize myself mentally, but it does no good.
The temperature inside my head will keep increasing as long as we're like this.
Because the dizziness isn't caused by my wound.

"...Tohsaka? It's fine now, right? Just use styptic and roll up the bandage."
"That's not called treating. ...I take it back. I'm angry. You went outside with a hackjob like this?"

A slapping sound.
"Gii......!"
W-What was that for...!?
Tohsaka just slapped me on my wound!!

"Guh, you...! Do you have some grudge against me!?"
"Humph. You have no idea. You should thank me for going easy on you."
Saying so, Tohsaka takes out something that looks like ointment.

"That hurts, right? I healed the dead nerves, so it should hurt for a while. There's painkiller in this ointment, but it's mainly to replace your flesh.
 It'll hurt until it familiarizes with your body, so don't do anything reckless until the pain goes away."

She takes the jelly-like substance and applies it to my wound.

It looks really suspicious, but I stay quiet since I know Tohsaka is seriously treating my wound.

"That's it. You should feel much better tomorrow if you wrap some bandages around it and get a good night's sleep."

She skillfully wraps the bandages around the wound.
...I'm not praising her or anything, but she does a much better job than I do.

"...Yeah. Um, thanks, Tohsaka. I feel much better."
I thank her while averting my gaze.
"Ehw-well, that's good. I'm glad I treated you if you say so."

"Yeah, it's even more helpful because I thought it wouldn't heal up.
 Thanks for treating the wound."
"H-Heh. That's only natural. It'll heal as long as I treat it."

Finishing the treatment, Tohsaka gets up.
...Then.
I don't know why, but she heads to the kitchen.

"Tohsaka?"
Am I seeing things?
She's checking what's inside the refrigerator and the rice cooker.

"Hey, what are you doing?"
"I'm preparing dinner. You haven't eaten yet, right? I haven't eaten either, so we're going to eat dinner."

"...Yeah, I can tell. But why cook dinner in this situation?"
"It's natural, right? People can't come up with good ideas on an empty stomach."

Tohsaka speaks while staring inside the refrigerator.

The sound of our utensils echoes inside the room.
It's past ten o'clock.
I don't know how it ended up like this, but Tohsaka and I are eating a late dinner together.

By the way, the dinner was made by both of us.
Tohsaka wanted to eat Japanese food, but she didn't even know how to make miso soup.
It really makes me wonder what they're teaching in the cooking class at school.

Tohsaka is concentrating on her meal.
She must be hungry, as her plate is almost empty.


But I don't have much of an appetite right now.
It's partly because this isn't the time to be eating, but more so because I haven't replied to Tohsaka.

'You can forfeit here, Shirou.'
I haven't told her my reply to those words.

"Tohsaka. I have something to talk about."
I put my chopsticks down and stare at Tohsaka.

"What?"
"I've been thinking. About my reason for joining this battle.
 And what I wanted to do."

"Yeah, and?"
She urges me to go on as she sips on the miso soup.
...She's putting my spirit down, but I try to get myself together.

"At first, it was because I was dragged into this. And I wanted to do something about this war.
 But it has nothing to do with how I became a Master or how I got dragged into this."


"I like superheroes. That's why I have to protect everyone. I don't care about this Master thing. It makes no difference that I'm not a Master or that I've lost Saber."

I say so, ready for Tohsaka's rebuttal.
...But...
"Oh, I see."
She makes an absentminded response and finishes her rice.

"Hey now, Tohsaka. I'm talking seriously, so"

"I am listening. You'll fight by yourself, right? The fact that people are dying bothers you more than the fact that you might die.
 That's why you decided to fight no matter how weak you are."

She looks straight at me.
It's as if she sees through the part of me that I don't even know aboutand most of all, she approves that I am fighting.

"Ehoh, yeah. That's right."
"What's with that face? You look like a squirrel that has licked sugar."
"Well. I thought you would object."

"I am. But I can't complain to you when you've saved me like that.
 ...And I understand that you're like that no matter how much I try to stop you."

Tohsaka averts her gaze a bit.
"?"
I don't know why, but

"Then we're still cooperating...!?"
"Yeah. I can't help it, so I'll go along with you. First of all, I'll be so worried that I won't be able to sleep soundly if I let you be by yourself. And..."
She takes a huge breath.
After getting ready for some reason...

"To put it in your words, I don't hate you, Shirou.
 ...So it's fine if we stay together, right?"

She hands me the bowl with a red face.
How long did it take me to realize that she's asking for seconds?

"Ohof course...! I don't care how much of a tyrant you are!"
I take the bowl, fill it from the rice cooker, and hand it back to her.
"...Fine. I'm hungry and the food's good."
Tohsaka starts eating the heap of rice.

"!"
I smile.
I bet I'm smiling as I eat.
But I can't help it.
I'm so happy right now, so let me smile like a fool for a while
I go back to my room and lie down.
Drowsiness fills my body as soon as I do.


I stare at the dark ceiling.
We are going to Ilyasviel's hideout tomorrow.

No matter what kind of negotiations take place, it's obvious that we'll need energy.
Tohsaka said we wouldn't get good results with tired bodies, so we decided to head out after we sleep.

"...It's five hours until dawn. We have to go talk to her after that."

The young Master that appeared on the night I became a Master.
If Saber is a Servant excellent in all aspects, Berserker is a Servant specialized in battle.
There is no Servant that can match Berserker in simple combat.

"How can I talk to such monsters?"
Saying it makes me believe it's impossible to negotiate with them.
But

Strangely, I don't feel any uneasiness.
I think Ilya will understand us if we talk to her.
...Just like Tohsaka, she will classify enemy and ally as a magus, but I think she's a proper girl with all that aside.

"...Man, what wishful thinking when I haven't even talked with her yet."
I bet he would scorn me, saying that it's a convenient fantasy.
But what's wrong with believing?
Is it wrong to have hope for someone you haven't met yet?


I realize that I'm gritting my teeth.
The man who told me to drown in my ideals and die betrayed Tohsaka in front of me.
A guy with that much trust and power switched his allegiance so easily.

"Archer."
My mind darkens.
No, it's freezing.
My head cools down thinking about what he did.

I'm angry.
I can't forgive him for betraying Tohsaka.
I can't forgive the fact that he cast away his partner.
Iwill swear here.
Even if that may have been the very best action and even if it turns out that it was the right choice to survive, I will never do something like that.

His actions have been getting on my nerves.
He told me not to talk about ideals.
I opposed him when he told me I cannot save everybody.
ButI agreed with his words somewhere inside of me.

...His words are correct.
The superhero my father talked about is just a fantasy, and I accepted the fact that I would have to become like him to get as close to the ideal as possible.
Not wanting to do so, I openly denied the idea even though I accepted it in my mind.

...But this isn't on such a level.
I can't approve of him.
I can't approve of his action no matter what the circumstances may be.
I won't be able to keep standing if I approve of him.

"That's why I can't lose to you."
...My words do not disperse into the darkness, but stay in the room.
A few hours until dawn.
I keep repeating those words even in my sleep
She is alone with her thoughts in the darkness.
It has been a day since she attacked the church and killed the priest.
It has been a day since she declared that she can find it, no matter where it may be hidden, if it "exists".
It may not be the case for other Servants, but there is no way someone versed in magic like her would not be able to find a relic as holy as the "Holy Grail".
Then there is only one answer.
The Holy Grail was never hidden in this church to begin with.


She sighs and puts her fingers on her temple.
...When she closes her eyes, heavy darkness assails her body.
No, it is just a scream.
It is not coming from outside.
The scream comes from her body and mind, telling her that her fatigue is at the limit.

It has been a month since she was summoned.
Since then, she has done her best to win.
Her Master is an ordinary person without a Magic Circuit, and she is the weakest of the Servants.
To make up for that, she abused forbidden magic.
Collection from the people. The magical string she placed throughout the town and the control of the ley line using sacrifices.
...These are all reasons why she was called a witch during her life.

But she has never used them before.
She should have never used them, and she did not intend to do the forbidden.
So...
Why did she end up using them for a meaningless conflict like this?

She became a heroic spirit to take revenge.
But she also knows it is meaningless to use the skills that labeled her a "witch".
She only uses trivial magic.
She only created disasters that caused people to destroy themselves with their own greed.
That was all the revenge she could manage, so what caused her to stray from her path so much?

"...It is all for the Holy Grail. It is natural for me to go crazy for something that can grant any wish."
That is a lie.
She knows the true identity of the Holy Grail.
She already knows what that thing is and why Servants like her are summoned.

...It is true that most wishes can be granted using the Holy Grail that appears in this town.
It will allow her to stay in this world with physical form, and it will allow her to start a second life as a "human".
But.

"How stupid. There is no meaning in such a thing."
Saying so, she closes her eyes.
She empties her mind.
For nowshe lets her guard down and rests her mind.

...She hears the sound of rain.
It was a night without moonlight.
The surroundings were pitch black, and she wandered with an empty mind.
That is where she met him.
With bloodstained body and frozen limbs.
A chanced meeting that was more miraculous than any miracle.

It was the mountain where the Ryudou Temple is located.
Falling rain.
She was stumbling aimlessly through the dense forest.
"HaaHaa, ha"
She left behind a trail of blood.
In her hand was a dagger that breaks all contracts.
Her purple robe was wet with rain, and her limbs had turned white from the winter cold.

"HaHaa, ha......!"
She staggered around, holding on to the trees for support.
She walked on, dirtied with mud, her breath ragged, reaching out her hand as if begging for help.
She did not look like her usual self, filled with cool composure.
No, even the amount of magical energy was unlike her.
She was exhausted.
She only had a handful of power left.

For a Servant, magical energy is like a lifeline that allows them to stay in this world.
But that was all lost. No magical energy was coming from her Master.
But that was only natural.
She had just killed her own Master.
That was the cause of her exhaustion.
SheServant Caster was about to disappear alone as compensation for obtaining freedom.

"Haaaha, hahaha"
A dry laugh.
It is funny that her body was not able to maintain itself and that she betrayed her vulgar Master.
Moreover, it's quite amusing to see how badly she had underestimated the relationship between Servant and Master.

She had done well.
Her Master was a legitimate magus.
He was in his thirties, had a medium build, and had few noteworthy characteristics.
He had no will to fight, but dreamed of victory. He was a man that only waited for the other Masters to kill each other.

The man had not trusted Caster.
He treated Caster coldly as she was a superior magus, and he insulted her for being inferior to other Servants.

She gave up on him after a few days.
She acted as an obedient Servant and filled the man's conceit.
In short, she made him use his Command Spells for meaningless things.
She told him he did not need the Command Spells.
She made him believe that she would be faithful to her Master even without the Command Spell.

It was his fault for believing in her.
The Master used his third Command Spell for a meaningless thing, and was killed by Caster at that moment.
It was easy.
She did not like the fact that the contract with him still existed, so she killed him using the Rule Breaker.

"Kuh, ah"
But she had made a mistake.
Servants exist using the supply of magical energy provided by their Masters.
But not just magical energy.
Servants are only allowed to exist in this age by being connected with people of this age.
In other wordsto lose one's Master, the passport to this age, means being forced to return to the "outside" world.

...But she would not normally be this exhausted.
This was the curse her Master had left her.
Her Master did not approve of her, as she was a better magus than he was.
Therefore, he limited her magical energy to be always below his level.

The magical energy level of a mere human cannot keep a Servant in this world.
She would normally be able to stay in this world for two days after losing her Master.

But now was different.
Her magical energy was drastically decreasing with every second, and the end was near.
...Probably a few more minutes.
She would disappear if she could not find her next Master in that time.
She would disappear before she could fight, unable to do anything. She would be a pitiful Servant, summoned only to be trampled upon.

"Ahhaa, ha"
It was vexing.
It was vexing, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.
It had always been like this for her.
She was treated unreasonably like this all the time.
She was always used as a tool, and she was never understood by anyone.

Yes.
Her life was always controlled by someone else.
Her mind was destroyed at a young age to save a hero chosen by the gods.
Just for the sake of a hero the goddess of beauty happened to favor, the goddess cursed her to blindly love a man she had never seen.
The girl betrayed her father, and she was even forced to betray her own country.

...There is no memory after that.
After everything was over, the girl, who was a princess, was in an unfamiliar country.
A girl that betrayed her father, the king, for a man.
A witch that cut apart her own brother and threw the pieces into the sea to escape her native country.
And the man who wanted it done cast her aside in order to become king, saying he could not marry a witch.

She was controlled and taken to an unknown country, was marked as a witch, and the only person she could rely on threw her away.
That is her origin.
There is nothing people can blame her for, and people around her were aware of that.
But still, people continued to demand for her to be a witch.

An evil to protect the king.
An evil to be on the receiving end of evil superstitions.
People wanted a convenient scapegoat that they could blame for any disaster.
This pattern has never changed.
People demand easily understandable evil to reassure themselves of their own goodness.

In that regard, she was the perfect sacrifice.
The father she could rely on was in a distant country.
Nobody defended her, and people gladly blamed her for all the ugly things in their world.
They decided that every ugliness was the witch's doing:
that they are poor, that they hate others, that humans are ugly, and even that people die.

"HaHaha, ah, ha"
...So she merely accepted it.
Since she could only live as a witch, she decided to live like a witch.
She swore to show them the ugliness of the wishes they demanded of her.

If people do not know their ugliness, so be it.
They can stay ignorant, go to hell for their own crimes, and suffer forever.
They won't be able to get out of hell.
They will suffer forever as criminals because they do not know what crimes they have committed.
That is the reason for existence she imposed on herself.
That is the only role people gave to the girl, to the one called the witch, who never had a free will.

"AhAh"
But...
Nobody actually wished for such a thing.
The same goes for her as well.
She seeks revenge against her will, without having any wish for herself.
Yes.
Until she met up with this stranger.

A rustling sound.

She peered ahead, even though she was barely able to stand.
It's midnight.
Who could possibly come into this forest at this time?

"What are you doing there?"
It was a heavy voice.
She did not have the composure to check who it was.
She just thought it was all over.
She had no power to use magic.
Her purple robe might have looked like a coat, but she was covered in blood.

A woman covered in blood was hiding in the rain.
It is obvious what such a person did.
Anyone would run away first.
What would they do after that? They would either call the police or pretend they hadn't seen it.
...It did not matter to her, as she could no longer move.

That caused the last of her spirit to give out.
Her last moment was cold and lonely, just as it was at the end of her true lifetime.
Or so she thought.

When she regained consciousness, she was in that place.
In front of her is that manthe man who she met in the woods.

"So you've awakened. Can you tell me your circumstances?"
Those were his first words.
When she watched the man with blank amazement...
"Go home if I did a needless thing. If you wish for me to forget about this, I shall do so."
...The tone of his voice never changed.

...That was her first encounter with her Master, Kuzuki Souichirou.
Kuzuki was a strange man.
Should he be called a ghost?
He had no reason to live, but had no reason to die.
He was just there, and since he existed, he followed whatever whim took him.

He has no self.
That was her first impression of him, and she thought it would be easy to turn him into a puppet.
She grew to realize that the thought was a mistake.
Kuzuki Souichirou does not have a past.
He has no self because he has no past, but it does not mean Kuzuki Souichirou is empty.

Kuzuki was a sincere man.
He easily accepted her when she told him that she wanted him to be her Master and when she told him about her true identity.

When she asked him, "Do you believe such a story?"
He replied, "Was that a lie?"
He accepted it after she told him it was the truth.

And the most amazing part was the night they met.
As she was about to disappear, she told Kuzuki to lay with her.
After making a difficult expression...
"Let me ask. Do you want it rough or gentle?"
After that, he made love to her without waiting for her reply.

To put it his way, they had sex before the Buddha.
It seemed rough like Asura, but it also seemed gentle like Bodhisattva.
...Either way, the contract was completed.
She obtained a new Master, was able to stay in this world, and returned to her role of being a witch.

...She still considers it to be a miracle.
She would have disappeared before she woke up if she wasn't taken to the Ryudou Temple.
The Ryudou Temple is a demonic place for Servants, but it is a perfect summoning place once inside.
As the Ryudou Temple is surrounded by a boundary field, it is suited for keeping anything inhuman.

She was able to remain without disappearing because she was brought to the Ryudou Temple. Had it been anyplace else, she would have vanished after being taken there.
As a result, she obtained the best ley line and the best protection.
She easily occupied the Ryudou Temple, figured out the mechanism of the Holy Grail, and summoned Assassin as the fifth Servant.

But such things are trivial matters.
She was certainly lucky on that night.
Many miracles saved her, and she is now on the verge of victory.
But they do not deserve thanks. She would have been fine with it even if those miracles had not occurred.

There is only one important fact.
A very small matter that is trivial for anyone else.
For her, the fact that she was able to meet Kuzuki Souichirou is a miracle beyond belief.


But it's not going well.
No, she feels that everything she does is not going well.

Her Master will not be delighted with what she did.
He has never had an interest in the Holy Grail.
She would do her best to grant any wish of his, but Kuzuki Souichirou has none.

A one-sided relationship.
They do not get along well.
It is not going well at all.

"So the mummy hunter became the mummy? Even the rare witch is fragile, huh?"
"!"
She turns to the intruder.
It is not her Master that is standing there.
It is the knight in red, Archer, with his true identity still unknown.

"...Archer. I thought I ordered you to keep watch outside."
"Yeah, but I didn't see any enemies around here. I got bored, so I came to check what was going on in here."

"...Heh, I would assume so. The only enemy we have is Berserker. Even with him, we will go attack them ourselves once Saber is fully controlled. We have had nothing to fear since you joined us.
 Isn't that why you came to my side?"

"Who knows. Don't you think I only wanted to break my contract with that Master? Don't you think I didn't care who my new Master was?"
There is some truth in Archer's words.
...But what does it mean?
Archer had no intention of betraying, but betrayed his Master only because he wanted to break his contract with Tohsaka Rin?

"...I see. So you did not like looking after that little girl? Well, it is true that Servants are dissatisfied with their Masters. It is natural for you to run out of patience with yours."

"No, she was perfect as a summoner. But some miscalculations occurred.
 And Caster, let me warn you. Do not consider all Servants to be like you.
 At the very least, Saber and Berserker were satisfied with their Masters. A righteous hero can only be summoned by righteous people."

"...Heh, why tell me that now? A twisted Master calls for twisted heroic spirits. You do not need to tell me that."
...That is right. Servants are determined by their summoners.
Summoners with dark shadows in their mind cannot summon heroic spirits who are on the light side.

In that regard, she and Rider are not heroic spirits.
A twisted Master calls for twisted heroic spirits.
As Rider was "one that was beautiful", she was also "one that was pure".
It is ironic how the Servant Caster summoned is a fictional hero.

"But it is indeed strange once I think about it. You and Rider are ones that oppose the heroic spirits. But you two are still summoned as Servants.
 ...Well, the Holy Grail does not differentiate between good and evil. So I guess it will summon anyone with powers, huh?"

"Originally, a mixed spirit that had a heroic side would not have been called upon.
 Things went out of order starting with the third war. Heroic spirits like Rider and I were not summoned before that."

...That does not concern her now.
She is not concerned about the true identity of the Holy Grail.
Servant Caster's mission is to win this war.
She is not interested in what comes after.
No, to be honest, that is not the end she wishes for.

"Enough with the meaningless talk.
 Get back to your station. I don't care what you're thinking. You are my Servant now. Your life is in my hands. Put that into consideration when you talk to me."

"Understood. Then I shall live up to my Master's expectation like an obedient Servant."
The knight in red goes up the stairs.

Seeing him off silently, Caster lets out a long sigh.

One more day until Saber surrenders.
She does not have the Holy Grail yet, but she will approach the end once Saber falls.
...What will happen when the war ends?
Caster will make every wish come true with her powers.
It is not bad to live as a witch, like she swore before dying.

Butthe reason will go away once the war ends.
Even if she still has the will, her master will lose the reason to stay as her Master.
"I will obtain the Holy Grail soon."
Caster gracefully reaches out into empty space.
Her hard work is about to be rewarded, but her expression is like that of a criminal about to be executed.
I saw many corpses.
I died at that time and was reborn.

I do not have any regrets.
My eyes lost hatred there.
My hands lost anger there.
My legs lost hope there.
My self lost its self there.

Everything went away.
It is not because I gave up that I believed nothing would save me.
I just found out that it's natural.
It's just that dying people will die and survivors will survive.
I laid down on the rubble and stared at the burning field.
I understood everything then.
I thought I understood everything.

But I still considered it...
How wonderful it would be...
If I was able to save everything here.

That's what I admired.
I just wished nobody would have to suffer.
That's why I tried to become a superhero.
It was simple, and it seemed like an ideal existence.

That was why I aimed for it.
I knew where I had to be, but there were many ways to get there.
I kept on running, wanting to get as close to it as possible, even though I did not know what was right or wrong.

Many paths I took were crooked, and my destination was only getting farther away.
I'm taking the long way.
I've been repeating this for ten years since I got saved by Kiritsugu.

But I won't regret it.
I'm not as skillful as Tohsaka.
I will take the wrong path and lose a lot of things at times.
But I cannot discard them as meaningless.
I have to present meanings for everything I've trampled upon and everything that cannot be returned.

So I cannot lose.
It can't be helped if I lose against someone else.
But I can win against myself. I can always fight back against my mind that tells me to give up.
So that's all I swore upon.
There's only one thing that I believed in and wanted to believe in.

...That's right.
Even if I am walking down the wrong path, I will not regret believing in it.

"!"
I wake up from the light shining in.
It's before six o'clock.
The sky I can see through the window is a clouded one.

I get ready and leave my room.
My body feels well, and there isn't that much pain from my wound.
I shouldn't be a burden to Tohsaka even if we end up fighting.

"You're here. Are you ready, Shirou?"

...I'm ready, but...
Tohsaka has transformed.

"...? What, you look like a new soldier that just stepped on a mine. Are you not ready yet?"
"Um, that's not it. Tohsaka, you look different."
"Huh...?
 Oh, these? I only put them on when I do detailed work, so don't worry about it."

"......"
Well.
I guess it's all right if you say so.
What kind of magic is it? It looks so wrong, and yet so right.

"All right. We're heading to the forest on the outskirts of this town.
 It's a huge woodland, unkempt and far from the city.
 It has rejected human interaction for a long time, so the forest is big and wide. You know how there are a few people every year that get lost in there for going in without any preparations, right?"


I nod silently.
Our destination is the Einzbern villa that is said to be somewhere in that forest.
Our fate will be sealed the instant our negotiations fail and we end up fighting.
We won't be able to call for help, and it will be difficult to run away.
We cannot escape that forest unless we defeat that giantBerserker.

"Then let's get going.
 I stayed up all night figuring out where it could be, so we should be able to find it within half a day if we're lucky.
 We'll take a cab as far as the highway, so get some money ready."

She starts walking with a big bag in her hand.

"Hm."
I follow her with the usual shinai bag in mine.
...But Tohsaka.
Money for the cab is fine, but does that mean we'll be walking back on the way home?

We rode the taxi for an hour from the town.
We drove on the highway, passed many mountains, and reached the entrance to the forest.
Of course, the forest does not have any paved roads.
We finally reach the entrance to the forest after walking about a kilometer from the highway.


I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but I get nervous once I actually face it.
The forest is dark even though it's daytime.
The tall branches block off the sunlight, and it's hard to see more than a few meters ahead, let alone to the end.

"Shirou. Can you walk ahead for a bit?"
"...? Fine, but you're the one who knows where she could be, right? I think it'll do no good if I go ahead."
I complain as I enter the forest.
Then.

"What was that!? I felt a shock...!"
I pull back my foot.
I only felt the shock for an instant.
It's not that strong, so it'd hurt more if I hit my foot on the corner of a dresser.
...Well, in short, it was like static electricity.

"I thought so. I'm sure it's only for identification, but it seems she has the whole forest under her surveillance."
"Ehhold on. Isn't that bad?
 That means we got caught in an alarm, right?
 Then"

"I don't think it'll be a problem. We didn't come here for a surprise attack. We came to talk, so it would be in our favor to let them know we're coming."

"Oh. Be careful though. It'll shock you a bit."
"I know, I know. I can tell how bad it is by looking at you"
She waves her hand and steps into the forest.
Then.

"UKYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!"
Tohsaka jumps back with a funny scream.

"Wow..."
I hear fire hissing.
I want to believe it's my imagination that the leaves under Tohsaka's feet are scorched.

"...I guess there's personal differences on the alarm. It was light in my case."
I calmly analyze the situation.
"Kuhkuku, kukuku"
But it doesn't seem like Tohsaka is listening to me.

"That does it, kid...! I heard you laughing...!"

Tohsaka yells into the empty sky.
She's so angry that she might go to fight instead of talk.

...Well, anyway.
It seems talking bad about Tohsaka is fatal no matter how far away you are from her, so I guess I'll refrain from doing so.
My frozen body bursts.
My feet lift me up and my arms grab the railing at the same time.
I see Tohsaka as I do so.
She is biting her lips in anger while watching the tragedy below us.

...I know.
Tohsaka wants to stop him as well.
But we'll be the ones to be killed if we do so. She can't stop him.
That goes the same for me as well.
I know it's stupid of me to die trying to save a dying girl.

I don't care about that.
      I just can't leave her be.

That's all that fills my mind.
I jump down over the railing.
Tohsaka and Shinji both look in surprise at the intruder, but the man does not even look at me.

The man reaches for the girl's body.
"Stop!!"
I yell.
I stop him with all my might.

"Oh?"
The man stops his arm.
And he slowly turns to me like Death that found its new prey.
Going back over a month.
He was summoned into this world before anyone.

He was not summoned in this country.
A faraway foreign land.
The land is always covered in white, the sky is always gray, and the castle is built within a hidden mountain.

It is always winter in that land.
Coldness and stagnation, barrenness and longing
As they cut all ties with the present world and await the reproduction of the miracle, they are like living corpses.
The cold winter air steals their human warmth.
And the stagnant world does not allow them a new lifestyle.
...The family is the seeker of the Holy Grail.
Spring does not come for the Einzbern family until their wish is fulfilled.

It has been ten centuries since they started the search for the Holy Grail.
As they used every possible method to attain their goal, they were eventually able to forge the Holy Grail.
But even then, all they can build is the vessel.
The divine mystery that should dwell in there is empty, and they keep building vessels that will never be filled.

But a foreseeable end comes to them.
They perform a ritual to fill the vessel with help from outsiders.
The result is both a success and a failure.
The Holy Grail is made.
The Holy Grail should be filled with that method.
But they make many enemies at the same time.
Even though they should be the owners of the Holy Grail, they have been degraded down to common magi that "donate" help.

Their tenacity is abnormal.
No, they have been obsessed since that time a thousand years ago, when they almost obtained the Holy Grail.
They broke the rules and constantly pulled out the strongest card.
In the first one, they did not have time to do such a thing.
In the second one, they finally found a loophole in the rules.
In the third one, they summoned what they shouldn't have.
And in the fourth one...
They were sure of their victory, having the strongest card and its master.

The result was a total failure.
The Servant and the Master they selected betrayed them.
The man destroyed the Holy Grail, leaving behind his wife and daughter in the winter castle.
They were infuriated with the man's betrayal, and they lamented their mistake.
Outsiders cannot be trusted.
Their family, with their perfected Magic Circuits, will be the only ones to obtain the Holy Grail.

They had insurance to begin with.
And on the fifth one...
They finally prepared the strongest Master and Servant.
It was him.
Two months before the Holy Grail War began...
Every rule was broken for him, Berserker, to be summoned.

The days that followed were to only hurt the Master.
...The Command Spell engraved all over the girl was used to control Berserker.
It did no good as a Magic Circuit and only drained her life away.
Even the slightest move on Berserker's part caused the girl to scream in pain.

It was only natural.
The Holy Grail would appear in two months.
The only things keeping him in this world were the girl's magical energy and her Command Spell.
Berserker was not created from the magical energy of the Holy Grail.
Even if the girl may have been special, to keep Berserker in this world using her own magical energy was like having her life taken away.

Knowing that, they still did not allow for her to rest.
They abandoned them in the winter forest, filled with hungry beasts.
They gave them over to possessed corpses.
They threw them in a wasteyard full of failures.
The only way for the girl to survive was to rely on the giant she had been given.

She survived the training that was more like torture.
She would let the giant attack the oncoming enemies.
She would let out screams of anguish, but she allowed him to attack every one of her enemies.
...He does not know himself...
...When the process became a special one for him.

In contrast to her young appearance, she hated whining.
Everything that came out of her mouth was an insult.
She must have instinctively known that if she was going to murmur something, she would get stronger when she would insult and hate someone.
The girl scorned Berserker for being ugly and cursed his existence.
It was only natural.
The girl would not have had to suffer if he had not existed.
She would not have been thrown in hell if she had not been chosen as a Master.

The girl insulted the giant every chance she got and used him to take out her anger.
The pain had lessened by the time she mastered Berserker's control, which was when the Holy Grail showed signs of its appearance.
The girl took away the giant's sanity as if in revenge, treating him as a "mad warrior".
But he already knew that this was the girl's desperate opposition.

The girl did so to hide her weakness.
She walked with pride as if saying that she could live alone.
...And that she did not need any friends or collaborators.
...It was...
...A bluff to ignore the fact that she was fated to have nothing.

    "You're strong, Berserker."

The winter forest.
The girl timidly touched the arm covered in blood.
Surrounded by hungry beasts, the girl was prepared for her death, but desperately denied it.
At that time...
He was not able to move without an order from his master, and he was the first to be attacked by the beasts.

The beasts bit off pieces of his neck, head, and limbs.
With the scene in front of her, the girl screamed.
...As he had his sanity taken away, he cannot recall what she said back then.
But the girl yelled not for her sake, but for his.
Even though her body was destroyed whenever he swung his arm, she endured it for his sake.

That's why they were both covered in blood.
The giant was covered in the beasts' blood, and the girl was covered in her own blood.
...He remembers the winter forest.
The weight of the girl that rested on him, crying tears of anguish.
And he realized.
In that small, cold castle...
He was the only one she talked to.

"NoNo, Berserker...!"
Her figure appears in his vision.
It is just like that time. The tears he did not see on her since she became a complete Master. The girl is running to him in tears.
And the man slashes her.
The golden foe gashes her eyes with a single slash, taking away her light forever.

Her face is covered in red.
She still runs in spite of that, but falls over a piece of rubble as her eyes are cut.
The slender body falls over.
There...
The enemy's sword is brought down.

The sword misses her heart.
The girl is coughing up blood as her lung must have been pierced.
It is not instant death.
But it is fatal.
With her eyes slashed, her lung pierced, and her Servant eliminated, she has nothing now.

So she should at least die peacefully.
It might be a salvation if she would just go to sleep right there.
But...
"...Huh? ...It hurts, it hurts, Berserker..."
The girl crawls, leaving traces of blood.
Crying in pain, she crawls towards the black giant.

How much power was left in him?
Breaking the chains with all his might, he charges at the man.
"Heh."
The demonic lance is thrust.
The heart-piercing lance impales the giant.


That ends it.
The man pulls out the lance as if nothing has happened, and the remaining power in the giant completely disappears.

His body disappears.
All the power that was giving his body form has disappeared.
So all that is left for him is to disappear.
As he ran out of magical energy, there is no way for him to stay in this world.

He falls.
But in his last living moment...
He sees the girl fumbling around for him.

Power returns to his falling body.
The law of magic that constructed him, the regulation of the world that hates inconsistencies, the body that is crumbling away like sand...

      'You're strong, Berserker.'

He pushes aside all powers trying to eliminate him, using his own power of will.
He cannot disappear yet.
He is probably the only one she relied on.
He has to answer the solitary girl that believed in him although she insulted him.

"...Where are you? I don't know, it's so dark, Berserker"
With her eyes slashed, the girl crawls with her hands stretched out.
...She must want to feel him, as she cannot see now.
The bloodstained hands grope through empty space, trying to verify his presence.


There is no power left in him.
There is nothing he can do.
Berserker will fall here and die here.
His body has died, and there is no power left to support him.

   So I'm fine.
          I won't lose to anyone,           as long as I have you, Berserker

But that cannot be allowed.
His mind is dead.
Supporting his body with his will that should no longer exist, he parts from this world.
His body is still standing, just as it was when he was invincible.
As if to say his body has to be invincible until the very last second for the girl that depended on him.

...And the girl reaches him.
The hand that was grasping through empty space finally touches something.

"Oh"
Coughing up blood, the girl crawls to the hard figure.
...She cannot see, but she can still feel him.
Berserker hasn't lost yet.
She cannot see anymore, but Berserker is still strong like always.

"That's good, Berserker. Stay there, okay?"
Strength fades from her body.
She is hurt and scared, but it's all right as long as he's here.
He always protected her.
He was scary, but he was really kind.
His big body was like that of a dad, and she wanted for him to pick her up once.

"I'm not scared anymore even though it's dark. You're strong, Berserker.
 I'm safe if you're there like that"
She rests her body on him.
It feels as though he'll rest one of his big, solid hands on her head.
It's probably true.
He should be patting her head when she opens her eyes.

"......Mm... It's a bit cold."
Her body is cold.
Recalling the forest from that time, the girl smiles.
It happened so long ago.
Recalling the giant that protected her even when injured, the girl peacefully falls asleep.

The man reaches out for the girl that went to sleep.

"Stop!!"
I yell.
I don't consider the personal danger, nor what could happen to me.

"Oh?"
The man stops.
Behind him stands Shinji, surprised at the sudden intruder.
The man smiles ominously.

"Sto"
My shaking throat speaks up before I can think.
But...
There is no way that man will stop.


I couldn't even tell him to stop.
The man pulls something out of the girl with a smile.
A red object that looks like a poisonous fruit.
The thing in the man's hand is the girl's heart.


My mind burns down.
Fear of being killed mixes with my desire to kill him.

"So there was an audience. I understand how you want to observe my gallant figure, but"
With the girl's heart in his right hand...
"Watch what you say. No one gives orders to a king, you lowlife!!"
He shoots off one of his numerous Noble Phantasms at me.
The terrace falls.
The man's Noble Phantasm destroys the wall of the castle.


I don't move at all.
I don't care about the rubble falling down.
I don't have time to run, and I have no intention of running.
I don't care even if a big piece of debris scratches against my back.
I can't think of looking away from that guy now.

"Oh. So it is Saber's Master."

His red eyes react to my enmity.

I'm going crazy.
I'll die in the next instant. There's no way I'm not afraid of that.
But my body refuses to run away and keeps screaming to defeat that enemy.
The girl's corpse keeps ordering me not to forgive that man.

It's only natural for me to go crazy.
My mind churns with conflicting impulses towards life and death.


"It seems you have a will to fight, but that is nothing. You are worthless without Saber."
A sword appears in his left hand.
The sword is mercilessly raised and should come down to kill Emiya Shirou.


I keep glaring at the enemy.
I can't even think about showing my back to him.

"Hold on. I know this guy."
The man's sword stops.
Shinji, who was watching from the other side of the wall, walks to the center of the hall.

"Yo. Long time no see, Emiya. I didn't expect to see you here, so I'm a bit surprised."


The man does not move.
There's about ten meters between us.
...Would I be able to get near him? Even Berserker could not close this distance.

"Oh, are you so scared that you can't talk!? Well, I understand how you feel. I was like that when Rider got killed.
 Yeah, that's right, that's right! I'm glad you let me go back then!"

There's nothing I can use as a weapon.
But I don't care.
My head is clear right now.
I don't feel any uneasiness about projecting his swords right now

 "Hey, I'm telling you to look at me...!"


...I slightly shift my gaze in his direction.
I look at Shinji while keeping the man in my view.

"That's right. So you do know who's the most powerful here."

I gasp.
It's not because of what he said. It's unexpected that he is saying so from the bottom of his heart.

"That's right. So you know, right, Emiya? You'll die now."

...How out-of-place.
Why say something that's so obvious?

"Sorry I didn't introduce him to you yet, but he's my new Servant. He's more amazing than Rider, right?"
Shinji puts his hand on the man's shoulder.
And with a delighted face...
"Beg for your life, Emiya. I might consider it."
...He says something unimaginable.

"I refuse."
I do not hesitate.
I answer right away without showing any signs of even considering it.

"......! Fine, then you can die."
Shinji jumps back.

The man, still with a cold expression, finally brings his sword do
"Hold on. I won't guarantee your Master's life if you move an inch."
And the man stops his sword once again.

Everyone looks up.
Everyone down in the hall turns his attention to the girl on the terrace.

Tohsaka's hand is aimed at Shinji.
Even though Shinji is not a magus, he should know what that means.
Tohsaka's serious.
If the man brings down his sword, she will kill Shinji as retaliation.

"T-Tohsaka...! Why are you here...!?"

She doesn't answer, but just keeps her aim on Shinji.

"WWhat, are you really going to shoot me, you murderer...!?"
"You're the one who killed first.
 Well, I don't care about that. The right to kill and be killed are the same. You should know that with your human instincts even if you're not a magus."
"!"
Shinji retreats weakly, being stared down by Tohsaka.

And...
"Hm."
...The man just watches it in delight.

He looks at Tohsaka.
"......?"
...Then.
I think there was a strange shaking for an instant.

"I see. You know you will not be able to kill me, so you went after the Master instead. You brought on the negotiation because you know I would not stop even if you killed my Master."

"...That's right. You wouldn't stop even if I killed Shinji. But you can consider it in this situation, right?
 You can save Shinji right now. If you're a Servant, it should be a hard blow for you to lose your Master."

"Hah. I see, you are pretty clever. That is your only option if you want to save that scum."
His sword disappears.
He turns his back to me as if he's lost interest.

"...! What are you doing!? Who told you to stop...!?"
"Nothe situation has changed, Shinji. She will be perfect as the vessel."
"Huh?"

Shinji stops breathing.
His face filled with irritation suddenly turns into a dirty smile.
"I seewow, I'm glad you're still alive, Tohsaka."

"I see. I'm relieved as well. I've known you for a long time even though you're like that. It'd be discouraging to have you dead already."

Laughing, Shinji claps his hands.
...It's so strange.
Shinji shows no fear even though Tohsaka can end his life.
It seems an overwhelming joy is numbing his emotions.

"Oh well. With that aside, how about it, Tohsaka? Do you want to forget about Emiya and team up with us?"
"'Us'?"

"That's right. You should know that Caster is stocking up power. The Ryudou Temple is the altar this time. It's a bit unfavorable for us if she's taking position there and stocking up magical energy."

Shinji says this with both his hands raised.
That's an obvious fact.
If I have to add, it seems Shinji doesn't know Caster obtained Saber and Archer.

"You can tell, right? There's not much chance of victory by myself.
 I beat Berserker's Master, but this isn't enough. We can make one that will even beat Caster if you join us."
Shinji invites her with confidence.
To that...

"I refuse, Shinji. I don't know who you're connected with, but there's no way I would follow a guy that is being used."
Tohsaka refuses him without twitching a brow.

"WWhat...?"
"Can't you tell? I'm warning you since I've known you for a long time. You should get some intelligence to observe what's going on around you.
 You're the only one who considers Matou Shinji to be a Master. Don't you realize by now that you don't have talent as a magus?"
"You!"

Shinji's face stiffens up.
The harsh words must have caused him to forget that his life is in Tohsaka's hands.
"Do it, Gilgamesh! Kill Emiya and Tohsaka...!"
Shinji orders his Servant.


"W-What, I told you to kill them...! It should be easy for you to kill them before I get killed...!"
"No, this is too bad, but we are out of time. It will rot if we take any more time."

The man shows Shinji, who is walking up to him in anger, what is in his right hand.
...A red piece of meat.
It is the still-throbbing heart he ripped out of that girl.

"Kuh"
Shinji grits his teeth in vexation.

"Damn, don't regret it, Tohsaka! I won't let you be on my side now...!"
Shinji runs towards the gate.

...The other one stays.
And after watching his master's disgraceful behavior...
"So that is it. You have a good friend."
With those delighted words he leaves the room filled with rubble.
The sun sets and the hall is filled with darkness.
...We came here to look for an ally, but the only thing remaining here after turns of events is this empty castle.

"So, what will we do? We can stay here if we want to go into defense.
 There's food and beds here. If we fix the walls, we can probably manage to protect ourselves inside the castle.


That's the best thing we can do if we want to protect ourselves.
But we chose the path to "fight" because we couldn't do so.

"...No, it's meaningless even if we fortify.
 Any defense will be penetrated once Caster completely controls Saber.
 ...And even if we do survive here, it doesn't matter if Caster obtains the Holy Grail."

"Not only us, but the people in town will suffer as well.
 ...Then there's only one thing to do. We'll get Saber back before Caster controls her. We have to defeat Caster, Archer, Assassin, and Kuzuki-Sensei by ourselves."


I silently nod.
Since we could not get Ilya's help, that's all we can do.
...The sun will completely set soon.
We'll have to get out of this place before that and attack Caster before Saber is completely controlled

It's a simple plan.
The process will change depending on the situation. Our only objective is to confront Caster as a result.

It doesn't even matter if that only happens for an instant.
Caster is the weakest when it comes to hand-to-hand combat.
Even if she may be a Servant, there is a chance of victory if we can fight her two against one.
Tohsaka's jewels and my projection magic.
We can win if we use all of our abilities.

That's the result we came up with, and we go out of the forest believing in it.
We don't talk after that.
...There's only one reason not to.
We're desperately bluffing to try to deceive ourselves.

The morning light is gray.
The sun is blocked by clouds, obscuring the dawn.
A cloudy sky is above us.
The sky is more gray than black, and it reminds me of that time ten years ago.

It should rain soon.
An impure gray sky.
The man is standing below the cloudy sky.

"So you did come. I know your personality. I knew you would be back with some sort of a plan."
He stares at her with cool eyes.

"I'm sorry, Archer. I can't live up to your expectations.
 We have nothing to start out with. We thought for a day, but we couldn't come up with anything."

"What?"
"You might not believe me, but we're here today to die honorably.
 ...But I guess we're still a bit lucky. If you're here, it means Saber is still opposing Caster."

So there's four enemies now.
If we pass Archer, we can fight Caster and Assassin head on.
Our plan is that we would fight Archer together and confront Caster with the two of us.
...That's the lie Tohsaka made up.

"I see. Caster and Emiya Shirou. The scales tipped to Caster, huh?"
 Archer's question is a loaded one.

"Yes. I hate my own personality, but I guess I can't change it since I'm born with it. I'm inhuman at the very end."
Saying so with an emotionless voice, Tohsaka steps forward.

"Shirou. Archer will only attack you. I won't back you up. I'll try to fight Caster while you get killed."
Tohsaka apologizes with her back turned...
Confessing that she intended to use me as a sacrifice from the start.


How stupid of her.
She didn't have to say such a thing.

"Don't worry about it, you idiot. I know your personality."
"Huh?"
"You're not one to do anything without a chance of victory, right? That's why I knew. This is certainly the only way we'll have any chance of winning."

"Shirou."
Her back shakes a bit.
...Oh.
That's all the apology I need.

"Go. I'll keep Archer busy. I'll keep him here at least until you make it into the church."
I control my breathing and turn the gears of the engine.
I feel great.
I should be able to project his swords in this state.

"Thanks. I'm sorry, Shirou."
Tohsaka runs.
...Archer lets her go as if he has no interest in her.
"Well done. It seems you understand your own powers."
He emits an intent to kill.

"Trace, on."
...I project his twin swords.
The battle should be decided in an instant.
I only see Archer and the back of Tohsaka running to the church.

...Was it over in one blow, or was I able to last a few seconds?
The battle has ended, and I look up at the sky powerlessly.
A gray cloud is overhead.
It should rain soon.
The sky is near, and the clouds block my way like a wall.

"Tohsaka, please... be... safe"
My body is burning.
I hear the sound of flames from the church.

"Ha, ah."
The sun is too far away for my outstretched hand.
It looks like the time from ten years ago...
We walk through the dark forest.
Although we don't know his intentions, having Lancer's help means we don't need to stay at the castle anymore.
Lancer must have taken a liking to Tohsaka, as he keeps messing with her and getting hit by her.

"Hey now. You have your own Master, right? Then you should stay quiet.
 We're going to be enemies after we beat Caster, so it does no good to be talking. Anything other than planning is unnecessary."

"What, we can't talk because we're going to be enemies? You have less composure than you look like you have, huh? It should be natural for you to drink until dawn with someone that gets along with you, even if he may be your enemy."

"When are you from?
 All that 'friends today, foes tomorrow' business is out of style these days. If we don't think things all the way through, it's rude to the other party."
"...Wow. It sure became a boring world."

...Lancer does not learn his lesson.
I think they've been repeating the same kind of conversation for a while now.

"More importantly, Lancer. You know what your role is, right?"

"Huh? Yeah, leave it to me. You two are going to fight Caster and her Master, right?
 My role is to fight Archer.
 I'll have to fight Saber as well in the worst case, but it won't be a problem if all I have to do is keep them busy."

He speaks objectively.
He isn't even scared of fighting Saber and Archer at the same time.


Oh yeah, Saber commented on him when we were training in the dojo.
She said Lancer is the best when it comes to "surviving".

She praised him, saying that with his excellent agility and great experience, Lancer would be an impregnable wall if he went into defense.
...He must have fought many battles from disadvantageous positions when he was alive.
This man ran through fatal battles like a panther and lived on.

"...That's fine. But our enemy isn't just Archer and Saber. Caster also has Assassin. In the worst case, you'd have to fight three."

"Oh, that's bad. I don't like that guy. I don't even want to fight him one-on-one if I can help it. It's best to kill such a guy from a distancebut there's no point in worrying.
 Assassin won't be at the church."

"...? How can you say so? If Caster won't go back to the Ryudou Temple, wouldn't she call for her guard, Assassin?"

"No. Assassin is a Servant that Caster summoned, but he has his limitations because of that. He is a heroic spirit summoned to that place. He can't leave the Ryudou Temple, and in any case, Caster won't call for him.
 He is a Servant that Caster summoned without letting her Master know.
 She will try to hide Assassin as long as they're at the church, and I'm sure she won't let go of the Ryudou Temple either."

"She won't let go of the Ryudou Temple...? Does that mean..."
"It's because that mountain is the summoning place of the Holy Grail. Do you know? This is the fifth Holy Grail War, but there are only four possible places for the Holy Grail to be summoned into. Two of the places are the Ryudou Temple and the church.
 By the way, it was summoned at the church in the third war. The fourth one was summoned in a plain somewhere."

"Oh. I thought you didn't think at all, but you're pretty well-informed."
"It's just that my Master is fastidious. I'm not interested in your doings."

"Okay. ...But, I see. So the summoning this time has returned to the same place as the first time, huh?"
Tohsaka starts to ponder.
Lancer watches her with delight and walks on in the dark forest.


The date has already changed.
The day should be dawning by the time we get out of this forest.

...I mentally prepare myself as I walk.
We will fight Caster again in a few hours.
...I won't hesitate, even if that girl would have turned into our enemy by then.
We'll defeat Caster.
I have to tell myself that it is the most important thing right now.

We head to the battlefield.
No matter what may be awaiting us at the church at daybreak, we cannot stop now.
...We walk in the forest.
We're the only people in this vast place.

I don't hear any beasts, and the grasses are dead like corpses.
The endless rows of trees makes me think this forest goes on forever.

It's been three hours since we entered.
Just as our surroundings start to blur together...

"Found it.
 ...Geez, I'm still stunned even though I knew about it. They really did build something like that in such a place."

I follow Tohsaka's stare.
There's only darkness ahead.
Between the trees.
There is something unbefitting of these surroundings, visible through a crack so small that you'd miss it if you weren't careful.

"...What's that? Is that a wall?"
"It is a wall. Geez, what's up with them? They brought that whole thing from their country."

Tohsaka complains and heads to the "strange object" we can see in the distance.
I still can't tell what it is, so I follow her.

We get out of the forest.
The endless forest quickly ends.
No, it seems like the forest is scooped out here with a big spoon.

The sky curving above us is gray.
A giant dome.
It seems more like an underground kingdom than a clearing.

This is Ilyasviel's dwelling.
An old castle built within the forest.
A solitary castle without any visitors, too big for one girl, not to mention too desolate for anyone to live alone in.


...Anyway, it does no good to be standing here.
According to Tohsaka, Ilyasviel knows we're here.
Then we should go in from the front entrance as a sign that we're not here to fight.

"Let's go, Tohsaka... Tohsaka?"
Tohsaka is looking up at the castle with an alarmed expression.
Her face is tense as if she's confronting an enemy.

"Tohsaka. Is there something wrong?"
"...Yeah. There's someone else besides us here."
"Of course. This is where Ilya and Berserker live."

"That's not what I mean. There's someone else other than that. ...We're going in this way, Shirou."
"Ehw-wait...!?"

Tohsaka starts running towards a big tree by the wall, and I don't have time to stop her.
No, that's not all.
She grabs onto a branch and skillfully climbs up.


I look up in astonishment.
Tohsaka looks around and
She jumps and kicks at the castle.

A shattering sound.
The window breaks and the red figure disappears into the castle.

"Come on...! There's something seriously wrong with this castle...!"
"Hey, weren't we here to talk...!?"
But what's done is done.
I climb up the tree and jump into the second floor window like Tohsaka.

We enter the hallway.
Even before I'm dazzled by the magnificence of the castle, I sense the "abnormality" Tohsaka is talking about.

I hear sounds of fighting.
Swords crashing against each other.
Butwould such a storm-like battle even be possible?
Even the most fierce battle of swords, the battle between Berserker and Saber, did not create such sounds.

"Oh."
Then I suddenly realize.
This isn't the sound of swords crashing.
This is one against manythere is literally a war going on somewhere in this castle.

One side has to be Ilyasviel.
This is Ilyasviel's castle.
If there is a battle here, it could only be Berserker attacking the intruding enemy.

I run.
The sound is coming from below us.
Considering the location we came in from, the battle is happening right in the center of the castlein the guest hall.

I run through the unfamiliar castle.
This isn't the time to be talking.
I don't know what's going on, but something terrible is happening
Even though people have said this Tiger Dojo is meaningless, it is already in its 23rd session.
Well, this is a sudden announcement, but this is the last Tiger Dojo in part II!
Huh? But we have one more Tiger Dojo in part II according to the schedule.
Kaahhhh! Don't talk about the 24th one!
I have no business with a weakling that will die that way!
O-Osu!
I don't quite get it, but this is the last Tiger Dojo of part II!?
Yup.
There was a rumor on part I's final Tiger Dojo that this corner would be powered up, but I won't fall for something like that this time.
We will remain here alone and preserve this modest paradise.
.........Heh.
Ugh, I feel something rebellious.
Could this devil child be plotting something again?
Oh, that's a misunderstanding.
I'm just thinking that I might make you feel lonely because I can't be here often during part III.
Hm...!? You can't come to the dojo!? Could it be, Ilya-chan...!?
Yup. I'll be busy taking part in the main storyline.
It ended up like this in the Rin route, but part III is when my true worth comes out.
It seems you will be taking fewer parts in the main story.
My condolences to you. This is the difference between a heroine candidate and one who was not even considered to be a candidate.
Well, you can rest assured that I'll still be your friend even after I become a heroine. Let's see... When I take over the storyline, I can make you my servant...
......Hiya.
What are you doing!? I'm saying this out of good faith!
I don't need it! I don't need love if it's this painful!
Actually, you're disqualified to be my student! You will be too bright in my eyes if you become a heroine!
Get out! Get out-uwaaan!
Heh, I'm quitting as well!
You stupid Taiga! I won't forgive you even if you apologize!
...She's gone.
Well, this is fate. If my cute student will become a heroine, it is my role as her master to be hated.
Fight, Ilya-chan! Go after Sakura-chan and take her spot as the heroine!
Don't come back here! Because you'll take away some of my roles!
...Uhh. But it's kind of lonely that I have to do the last Tiger Dojo of part II by myself.
I'm lonely, but I'll do my best. Fight alone, me.
Well, this dead end is a bit special.
It's too reckless to enter battle with just Shirou and Tohsaka-san. There's no way you can win.
I know you might have something against him, but go ahead and shake hands with the "cooperator" that appeared.
For those of you for whom the cooperator didn't even appear!
You're a failure as a main character! How can you not save a girl that's about to die in front of you!?
The event at the castle is an important part of the story that reveals "a cause" that has been hidden up to now! You have to see it.
Tohsaka-san's route is also the main character's route. So go ahead and solve the problem.
Well, this is it.
Tohsaka-san's route is entering its climax.
There will be a series of fast events without a dead end after this, but let me give you one piece of good news.
Tohsaka-san's route has a "true end" and a "good end".
I can't tell what each of those is about, but the condition for seeing them is how faithful you were. It's either "only one" or "flowers on both hands". You get to find out after the battle.
All right, everyone, I'll be waiting in the part III Tiger Dojo.

"Ahkuh."
Caster regains consciousness.
Protected by Kuzuki, Caster looks around the temple.

...This is it.
The surprise attack won't work on Caster anymore.
Tohsaka is tired and I can only project two more swords.
If...
If Caster uses "her" in this situation, we will never make it out of here alive

"......Phew. I thank you, Master. I would have been defeated without you."
"You do not need to flatter me. Just get Saber. We cannot take them lightly."
"Yes. That is a good decision, Master."
Caster points to the woman on the altar.

The visible binding of the curse.
And when Caster tries to release it...

"Yes. If only you had done it a few seconds sooner."

Above me.
I hear a soft voice from the stairs leading up.


It is Caster that notices the strange event first.
Kuzuki doesn't notice.
It is because Kuzuki cannot detect magical energy.

Caster moves.
Above her Master...
Above Kuzuki Souichirou's head...
Are floating numerous swords.
"Souichirou!"
She must have figured out that her injuries will prevent her from blocking them with magic.
Caster uses her body to protect her Master.

       "Trace, on."

The murmuring voice from above says those words.


...The sounds end.
The swords appearing in midair come down at one target and pierce one body.
The numerous blades rip and tear the meat, then disappear like an illusion.

What's left are many traces of blood.
"Ah...... guh...... ah..."
It...
Having become his shield of her own free will, she now turns her bloody body to the man behind her.


Kuzuki is silent.
In front of him is the skewered Servant.
...Maybe there's no need to hide it now.
The robe is removed from her head, and the woman walks over to her master with a bare face.

"AhAh, ah"
...Her body is collapsing.
With a dying body, the woman looks up at her master who has not twitched a brow.
Her slender fingers run across the expressionless face.

"Ohare you okay, Master?"
Her voice seems clear.
There is no change in Kuzuki.
He only answers with a simple "yes" and does not even look at Caster.

"Good. It would trouble me if you died."
She looks as if it is fine.
...No, the woman smiles knowing what kind of man he is.

"But this is cruel. I finally found a wish..."
The fingers running along his cheek fall down.
Beginning at her toes, Caster's body is disappearing.

"You do not have to grieve. I will make your wish come true."
She smiles at the simple answer.
She smiles as if seeing a short-lived dream.
"That is impossible. Because my wish..."

Was being fulfilled until now.
The witch collapses as if going to sleep.

...The purple robe falls.
The robe without its wearer fades and disappears as if following her.


Kuzuki does not even look at her. His attention is focused on the man above.
The knight in red who should be above me.

I get a headache.
It's not just because I've abused projection.
The muttered spell...
The spell he said is smashing my brain with nausea.

'Trace, on'.
That's what he said.
He said the exact words of the spell that shouldn't be used by anyone else but me.


Archer comes down the stairs and stands in the temple.
Tohsaka is watching him with surprise.

"......Archer... I thought so, but... it's true?"

Archer does not answer.
He is only watching his enemy, Kuzuki.

"...Treacherous friend, huh? You were going for this from the start, Archer."
"Yes. But this is more like the Trojan horse.
 I had to defeat the Greek hero. So this is more appropriate as a comparison."
Archer shows no guilt even though he has betrayed Caster in front of us.

"I see. I guess it was Caster's mistake for drawing in a guy like you."
Kuzuki does not change his tone even in front of a betrayer.
He still has the will to fight.
He is not a magus and he has lost Caster, but he has the will to continue fighting.

...He readies himself.
As Caster is gone, Kuzuki's strength must have dropped substantially.
His "snake" is still there, but Caster's strengthening that made his fists into steel is gone.
But still, Kuzuki faces Archer like before.

"I see. I will not stop you if you want to continue."
Archer readies his twin swords.
Their duel has begun.

"Wha"
Is that all right?
Kuzuki said he has no interest in the Holy Grail.
A Master in name only, he merely went along with Caster.
Then there's no reason for him to fight now that Caster's gone.

"Hold on. Why are you continuing, Kuzuki? You were only doing as Caster told you. Caster's gone now, so there's no reason for you to fight anymore."
I glare at them, gritting my teeth against the pain.


Kuzuki narrows his eyes a bit.

"Right. I do not have a reason to fight. Like you, I had no interest in the Holy Grail."

"Then..."
"But this is something I have started. I cannot stop midway."
That's it.
That's all the reason he has.

The battle starts.
The battle should end in one blow.
Even if Kuzuki has superhuman fighting abilities, he's fighting a Servant.
He can't be a match just by being "superhuman".

Even though this is called a battle, it is actually just disposal of the loser.
The fate of the loser...
It is the battle between Masters to kill and be killed, and that is the end they have to be ready for. One shouldn't fight at all if he can't accept that.
But still
If I can save him...
Is it wrong to want to prevent his death if I can?
I don't care if I'm called soft-hearted.
I know it's just hypocrisy.

To defeat another Master means killing them.
We fought, prepared to kill each other.
I know how unfair it is to stop them now.

But still.
I decided to fight so that I could save people. I can't ignore a life that can be saved.

"Stop. The match is settled. You guys don't..."
I suppress my headache and try to stop them.
At that instant.
Kuzuki moves.

"Wha"
Kuzuki must have taken my voice as a signal, as he rushes Archer in a flash and lashes out at his temple.

Any ordinary man would have his skull crushed, but Archer does not dodge it.
His head moves from the impact.
The knight in red takes Kuzuki's blow, and pierces Kuzuki Souichirou's chest at the same time.

I have no right to stop them.
Even if he was Caster's puppet, Kuzuki did not stop her.
He did not stop Caster from sucking magical energy out of people, and he even supported it.
Theneven if he's not a magus, Kuzuki is a Master.

To defeat other Masters means killing them.
We fought, prepared to kill each other.

Kuzuki does not want any help and has not admitted defeat.
The man in front of me will only stop in death.
So.
How can I, a Master, stop them?

...And after a moment's confrontation, Kuzuki moves.
Kuzuki's fists haven't weakened at all.
They reach out like snakes to smash Archer's temple.
Archer dodges it by a hair and pierces Kuzuki Souichirou's chest as if to silence him.
"Shirou. Are your wounds all right?"
"Huh? Oh, yeah, it's fine. I feel good, and I can still use my circuits."
"...I see. That is good."

Apparently having run out of things to talk about, Saber awkwardly ends the conversation.

"......"
We've been like this for an hour since we came home.
We don't have the composure to be celebrating Tohsaka's safety, nor did we celebrate our reunion.

The situation isn't good at all.
The last Servant, Gilgamesh.
As long as he has the Holy Grail, we have to fight him.

...We don't have any plans to beat him. The more we think about it, the more we realize it's hopeless.
It's only natural for us to grow quiet.


But I don't think that's the only reason we're quiet.
...This is probably the end.
This will be the last time we will go into battle like this.
No matter what the results may be, what awaits us does not change.

The Holy Grail War will end.
After thatthe three of us won't be able to talk like this.

Looking back, it was only a course of about ten days.
I never had time to think back about what happened the day before, and I was too busy with all the events that came up one after another.
...But they weren't just painful events.
Looking back at it, these past ten days are precious memories that can't be replaced.


That's why we're keeping our mouths shut.
We don't want to admit the obvious truth.

The decision should be clear to all of us already.
We can't say it because we don't want to end it like this.

"Then I'll say it.
 I'm going to avenge Archer. He betrayed me and he was a twisted guy, but he's Shirou."

Tohsaka has made up her mind.
She says that she will fight Gilgamesh.
She clearly states that she will end this fight.

"How about you, Shirou? I'll have Saber come with me no matter what, but I can't force you to fight since you're not a Master.
 It seems that goldie really hates you, so I think he'll go after you first if we fight him."

Maybe Tohsaka's trying to be considerate by offering me an escape.
But I'm already determined.
I can't let Gilgamesh be.
I intuitively know that the Holy Grail shouldn't exist.
But there's a bigger reason for me not to back out of this.

You defeat him.
He left those words and let me survive instead of him.
...The man who only denied Emiya Shirou.
As I have made him admit his defeat, my path is determined.

"I'm going to defeat him. I chose to fight. He'll complain to me unless I keep my word until the very end."

"...I see. I won't stop you if that's what you decided."
"Yeah. And I can't just ignore the Holy Grail.
 If the Holy Grail is what he says it is, we have to destroy it. We'll completely destroy it so something like this will never happen again."


Saber has fought with the objective of obtaining the Holy Grail.
Her hesitation and reluctance aren't easily overcome. But still...

"I understand.
 If the Holy Grail is what Gilgamesh says it is, it should not exist in this world."
She kills her wish and assents.

"All right!"
I get up and head to the kitchen.
I put on the apron.
I tie it behind my back and roll up my sleeves.

"S-Shirou?"
"W-What? Did you come up with a good idea?"
"Huh? No, I'm just going to make something. You two are hungry, right?"

I ignore the astonished party and start preparing dinner.

"It's all decided. Now, we just need to act like always.
 We'll eat dinner together and go beat him after that."

I take out a bowl and a frying pan.
I'll use everything I have in the refrigerator.
I'll forget about everything tonight. I'll make a delicious feast.

"You are right. Let us eat dinner like always. That suits us."
"Yeah. Then I guess I'll help as well. Oh, Saber. Can you go prepare the bath?"

The serious atmosphere disappears like that.
The living room suddenly becomes more lively.
This will be the last night with the three of us.
We're doing our best to keep it like always and to have a good dinner.

So.
After eating dinner consisting of Western, Chinese, and Japanese food, we start the customary strategy meeting.

"So you are saying the Holy Grail is at the Ryudou Temple?"
"Yup. I guessed that the Ryudou Temple would be the summoning spot this time. I was using a familiar to spy on that place, but it was eliminated just a bit earlier. I'm sure that the goldie is there."

"...Ryudou Temple... That is troublesome.
 We can only enter that mountain through the front gate. Gilgamesh should be waiting for us there."

"Yeah. But on the other hand, it's easier on us because we know where he is.
 He's troublesome, but stopping the summoning of the Holy Grail takes priority.
 It would be ideal if we can destroy the Holy Grail while Saber keeps him busy."

"Hold on. Isn't Saber the only one who can destroy the Holy Grail? We can't touch it, right?"

"Right. We can't destroy the summoned Holy Grail. But we can destroy the vessel before it's summoned.
 To be more precise, we're stopping the Holy Grail before it's activated."

"Hm? What do you mean by stopping the Holy Grail?"

"...I really don't want to think about it, but from what I heard, the Holy Grail is Ilyasviel's heart, right?
 But I think the Holy Grail is a set with Ilyasviel's body, her Magic Circuit.
 He didn't want Ilyasviel to be the Holy Grail, so he pulled out the core of it, her heart."

"......So.
 He has to implant the heart into a magus's body to activate it as the Holy Grail. There are only two remaining Masters: me, and one other.
 Since I'm here, the one he will choose to be the foundation of the Holy Grail is"

"Shinji...!? But Shinji, um..."

"Doesn't have a Magic Circuit, right? ...I bet he doesn't care.
 He wants to make an incomplete Holy Grail, so I'm sure he'll implant it into an incomplete Master."

"...Even if its bloodline is extinct, the Matou family has hereditary traces of Magic Circuits.
 Even a closed circuit will be forced to open if something like a nuclear fusion reactor is implanted into him."


...Then that would mean we'll have to detach the Holy Grail from Shinji, huh?
I don't know what it means to be the Holy Grail's foundation, but, if possible, we'll have to stop it.

"But I do not think Gilgamesh will allow that.
 Does it not mean that stopping the Holy Grail is to defeat Gilgamesh?"
"...Yeah. It's obvious that he's protecting the Holy Grail, so we have to do something about him first."

"Yeah. I think he's waiting for us at the mountain gate. The only route we have is the mountain gate because our greatest force, Saber, can only enter through there.
 So"

"...I see.
 I will rush the mountain gate by myself.
 Rin and Shirou will sneak into the Ryudou Temple from the back while I do so.
 The boundary field on the Ryudou Temple is meaningless for you two."

"Exactly. ...You will need to give your absolute best, but just keep him busy. We'll come help you as soon as we stop the Holy Grail."
"Hold on. That's reckless. Saber won't be a match for him.
 She can't keep him busy."

"Huh? What? You seem to think pretty highly of him, Shirou."
"True. He is a strong enemy, but I will not lose easily if I go into defense.
 Please tell me what that opinion is based on."

"Oh, that's not what I meant. From what I see, Saber's stronger than him.
 I'm sure of it. I'll bet on it too."

"...? Then why are you saying that?"

"You can't beat him as long as you're a heroic spirit.
 ...Yeah, Saber won't lose if he only had the same Noble Phantasm as Saber. We don't even need to compare the two's skills as swordsmen."

"But his power isn't power as an 'individual'. A soldier can't beat war itself no matter how strong he is, right?
 He's a heroic spirit of that kind. You'll be defeated unless you're a 'war' just like him."

"......? ...So you are telling me that my attributes are not fit to fight him?"

"Yeah. Tohsaka, we can't let Saber fight him without a plan. There's no way she can win unless we have some sort of a countermeasure."
"Hey... I know that already.
 That's why we're going to think about it now."

"Hm. Then you have a plan, Rin?"

"Hey now. I won't conveniently come up with an idea in a flash.
 His Noble Phantasm is a war, like Shirou said.
 The outcome of a war is decided by how much force you have, right? It's not how well you can handle the weapon. It's how much force you can prepare"

"......? What's wrong, Tohsaka? Why did you shut up all of a sudden?"
"...I see. That's why he treated you like an enemy. Since the heroic spirit doesn't have his own Noble Phantasm, there is no original. Oh... wait. That means..."

"...Rin? What is wrong? Why are you behind me?"
"I-It's nothing...! I'm going to think, so just talk it over with just the two of you...!"

"...?"
Saber and I look at each other.
...Well, I'll leave her alone if she has an idea.

"...Then I should avoid fighting Archer one-on-one, correct?
 But I have backup from Rin.
 I can use my Noble Phantasm with her support. I believe there is a chance of beating him before he can use his Noble Phantasm."

"Your Noble Phantasm...? Not Invisible Air?"
"No. Invisible Air is only a sheath.
 I can use my holy sword if Rin allows it.
 This is the sword that previously destroyed the Holy Grail.

"I see. Then it'll all be up to Tohsaka?"
"Yes. There will be a big burden on me as well as Rin if I use it. I will probably use up most of her magical energy."

"Did you hear that, Tohsaka? How much magical energy can you spare?"

"M-Magical energy I can spare? How do you know what I'm thinking about...!?"
"Huh?"

"...N-No, it's nothing. I told you to leave me alone. I know about Saber's Noble Phantasm.
 She should be able to use it twice with our magical energy.
 We're going to use it once against the Holy Grail, so you can only use it once against Gilgamesh."

"...I see. Um, Saber. That's what Tohsaka's saying, so what do you think?"

"...I do not know. If Archer has every existing Noble Phantasm, he should have one that can equal mine. After that, it depends on whose is stronger."

"...I see. So it's going to end up being a fight between the Noble Phantasms, huh?"
...Then Gilgamesh is likely to win.
I can't let Saber fight such a hopeless battle

Man, I can't think!
She's been acting strange.
Why does she keep on looking at me like that?

"Hey, Tohsaka. Come out with it if you want to say something. You have an idea, right?"
"I-I don't have an idea! I can't say such a thing here, you idiot!"

She yells at me and looks away awkwardly.

"......Shirou?"
"No, it's nothing. She's acting weird, so let's ignore her and keep planning."

We continue with the strategy meeting with just the two of us.
...But as our "brain", Tohsaka, won't talk, we can't come up with anything.

"We can go with the previous plan if you guys can't come up with anything.
 We'll head out before dawn. Everybody is to rest until then."
Our course of action is decided by Tohsaka.

Some time passed after that.
It's almost midnight.

"......"
Tohsaka told me I should take a nap, but I can't sleep in a situation like this.
We're going to settle our score with that Servant in a few hours.
Since we are heading out before dawn, everything should be over by the time the sun rises.

"........."
I can't just lay here and not do anything.
I
"Yeah. I can't sleep in this situation."
A plan against Gilgamesh.
If we are to fight that cold-hearted enemy, I'll have to come up with some plan.

Someone will die if we head to the Ryudou Temple as we are now.
Compared to that, thinking until the very last minute is nothing.

"Are you awake, Tohsaka?"
I knock on her door.

"......! H-Hold on! Don't come in!"
......Hm.
I thought Tohsaka would be sleeping, but I guess she's still awake.

More importantly, she's in a panic.
After a few minutes of rustling sounds...
She must have calmed down.
After taking a breath I can hear even outside, Tohsaka opens the door.

"So, what?"
Tohsaka glares at me as soon as she sees me.

"Well. I want to continue our conversation from earlier. I want to keep talking about how to fight Gilgamesh."

......Wait.
Why are you glaring at me?

"Tohsaka. Are you in a bad mood?"
I ask the obvious.
OF COURSE!
That's the obvious response she's going to give, but I have to ask.
But...

"...No. That's not true."
She gives a strange response.

"Tohsaka. Are you sick or something?"
"No! ...Geez, just sit down!
 I'm going to give you a plan to beat Gilgamesh since you can't come up with any!"

Tohsaka pulls me inside, locks the door, and walks to the back of the room.

"......?"
I move to the center of the room for now.
I sit down on the cushion and face Tohsaka, who is sitting in a chair.



And an awkward silence follows.
Tohsaka is silent even though she's the one with the plan.

"Tohsaka. About Gilgamesh..."
"...I know. You don't want Saber fighting him, right? You're especially kind to her."

"Hey, that's not the point here.
 I'm saying that we should switch the roles since Saber won't fare well against Gilgamesh. If Saber is defeated, you'll be his next target."

"......Humph. You say switch roles, so what are you thinking?
 I'm going to pass. That goldie used his riches to collect all the magic-resistant equipment in the world.
 I'll do much worse than Saber. That should be the same for you as well, right?"


That's... true, but...

...I can't get those eyes out of my head.
Archer definitely told me this.
That the golden Servant...
That only Emiya Shirou can match Gilgamesh.
I'll go talk to Saber.
...Even if we're able to defeat Gilgamesh, Saber will leave once the war ends.
Saber will destroy the Holy Grail herself and be relieved of her duty as a Servant.
I won't be able to see her ever again.

...A last conversation.
I want to save something between us before we go into our final battle.

"Shirou? Why are you here?"
"Oh, I just felt like coming to see you. Oh, am I a bother? Were you meditating in preparation for the battle?"

"Ehn-no. That is not true.
 I am happy since I wanted to see you as well, but... Um, I thought you went to Rin's room."

"...? Why would I go to Tohsaka's room? She didn't call for me."

"Y-You are right. Please do not worry about it since it was just my imagination.
 I-I thought that would be for the better, but I guess that was my concern."

"???"
Saber is acting even weirder.
...I don't know why, but I guess she'll blush even more if I let her be.

"What's wrong, Saber? You're acting weird.
 Did something happen?"

"I-I am not acting weird! I am merely resting in preparation for the battle.
 But what about you, Shirou? I thought you were going to sleep so that you can go to the Ryudou Temple in perfect condition."

"Hm."
If she asks me like that, I can't tell her it's because I wanted to see her face.

I can't tell her, so...
"...Hm, I couldn't sleep either. I just thought I'd drink tea with you since I'm awake.
 I think Tohsaka's busy, you know?"
I come up with an excuse on a whim.

"Tea...? Even though we will be fighting the king of heroes in a few hours?"

"Yeah. We can't rest because we're so tensed up, right?
 Then have tea with me. I'll make you the best tea."
I invite Saber by force.
My face is all red and it's embarrassing, but I want to drink tea with Saber.

"Yes. It will be my pleasure to have tea with you, Shirou."
Saber nods kindly.

If it's decided, I should hurry up.
I'll go to the kitchen, brew the Chinese tea I bought for a special occasion, and I'll treat Saber

So.
We didn't do anything but drink the tea.
We didn't talk, not even a single word.
We just absent-mindedly stared at the dojo.
We watched the wooden floor we used to train on.

"Shirou. Please go see Rin. Knowing her, I am sure she has her new idea thought out."
"Oh, really? I guess I'll go if you say so."
I get up and leave the dojo.

"I shall see you later, Shirou."
"Yeah. I'm gonna go check on your foul-tempered Master."

I leave the dojo while Saber sees me off.
That ends our final time together.
I didn't leave anything definite.
I couldn't make any sure promise, no sensations I would be able to recall, no proof at all of Saber's existence.

...But I think this is right.
What's left are memories that fade away.
So I'll cherish this trifling event and hold it strong in my heart.

"Hey. Are you awake, Tohsaka?"
I knock on the door.

"...I'm awake. Don't you have to sleep? I thought you were talking to Saber in the dojo until a minute ago."

"Oh, were you watching?
 ...I see, you can see the dojo from your room.
 You should've come, Tohsaka. It would've been better to have tea with the three of us."

"............That's fine.
 ............That's not fine at all.
 Well, come on in. I was about to go talk to you anyways."
Hmm. Those are surprisingly biting words.

"...All right. Excuse me."
I tilt my head in wonder as I enter her room.

"I guess you're pretty calm. What were you doing with Saber?"
Then.
Tohsaka glares at me the instant I see her.

"Oh. I was only drinking tea with her.
 We can't be training when we're going to be fighting soon. I can't use up extra energy."

"Extra energyy-you're right. We can't be using extra energy."
...Wait.
Why did she become so quiet?

"...Tohsaka. Are you in a bad mood?"
I ask the obvious.
OF COURSE!
That's the obvious response she's going to give, but I have to ask.
But...

"...No. That's not true."
She gives a strange response.

"Tohsaka. Are you sick or something?"
"No! ...Geez, just sit down!
 I'm going to give you a plan to beat Gilgamesh since you can't come up with any!"

Tohsaka pulls me inside, locks the door, and walks to the back of the room.
"......?"
I move to the center of the room for now.
I sit down on the cushion and face Tohsaka, who is sitting in a chair.



And an awkward silence follows.

That's... true, but...

...I can't get those eyes out of my head.
Archer definitely told me this.
That the golden Servant...
That only Emiya Shirou can match Gilgamesh.
...I'll think by myself for while.
I still have time.
I might come up with that Servant's weakness if I recall everything that happened during this Holy Grail War

"Huh......!?"
I jump up.

"......I can't believe it. I fell asleep."
I probably fell asleep because I could not think of anything.
I fell asleep, and before I noticed

"......Oh. Good, it's not even one o'clock yet. I only slept for about half an hour."
I couldn't imagine my embarrassment if Tohsaka had to come wake me up after I'd slept all night.

"That was close... I can't let Tohsaka see me like thi"
"......Shirou, are you awake?"
"T-T-T-Tohsaka......!?"

I get up, suppressing my pounding heartbeat.

"I-I'm awake! I'm totally awake!"
I reply while trying to make myself look straight.

"I see. Then can you come to my room? I have something important to talk about."
...Then.
Tohsaka goes back to her room without noticing how sleepy I sound.
"......?"
I don't get it, but I should go see her if she has something to talk about.

"Excuse me. So, what do you want to talk about?"
"............"
What's going on?
Tohsaka glares at me the instant I see her.

"Tohsaka. Are you in a bad mood?"
I ask the obvious.
OF COURSE!
That's the obvious response she's going to give, but I have to ask.
But...

"...No. That's not true."
She gives a strange response.

"Tohsaka. Are you sick or something?"
"No! ...Geez, just sit down!
 I'm going to give you a plan to beat Gilgamesh since you can't come up with any!"

"......?"
I move to the center of the room for now.
I sit down on the cushion and face Tohsaka, who is sitting in a chair.



And an awkward silence follows.

"Tohsaka. About Gilgamesh..."
"...I know. You don't want Saber fighting him, right? You're especially kind to her."

"Hey, that's not the point here.
 I'm saying that we should switch the roles since Saber won't fare well against Gilgamesh. If Saber is defeated, you'll be his next target."

That's... true, but...

...I can't get those eyes out of my head.
Archer definitely told me this.
That the golden Servant...
That only Emiya Shirou can match Gilgamesh.
"...Tohsaka. Don't get mad and hear me out.
 I'm going to fight..."
"You're going to fight him, right?
 ...Oh, so you realized it too, huh? Gilgamesh's natural enemy is Archer's magic."

"Huh?"
I open my mouth in surprise.
"Huh? ...You said you're going to fight him when you haven't realized that?"

"UhI didn't have any proof, but I thought that I might have the best luck against him."

".....Oh. I don't know who told you that, but you're right.
 What makes Gilgamesh so strong is the number of Noble Phantasms he has. But to put it another way, one can match him if one has the same number of Noble Phantasms."

"The same number of Noble Phantasms..."
It means I need to reproduce all the Noble Phantasms he takes out.

"...That's right. He was calling you guys fakers. That's probably because he saw you two as a threat. Heroic spirit Emiya would be a complete match for him."

That's true, but...

"...But that's impossible.
 I can barely manage to project one of Archer's swords.
 I can't keep up with his Noble Phantasms, and I don't have enough magical energy to do so."

"That's if your magic is just like it was until now.
 But you remember what Archer's Noble Phantasm was, right?
 You can match Gilgamesh if you can use that magicthat Reality Marble."

Tohsaka stares at me.
But I can't live up to her expectation.

"That's impossible. The Reality Marble is the ultimate forbidden magic. I don't know how to use it, and Archer used magical energy several times my capacity to create that world. That's totally impossible."

"...Yeah. I know it's impossible.
 But you should know how to use it because all your magic is rooted in that.
 'Strengthening' and 'projection' both stem from your Reality Marble.
 I'm sure it'll be a piece of cake once you have the necessary magical energy."


She's talking about impossible things.
I have no way to do it, so this is more impossible than for me to go to the moon.

"......Okay. Let's say that's the case. But it's still impossible. I don't have the magical energy to set up the boundary field or maintain it.
 He must have trained his Magic Circuit for a long time, but I don't have the magical energy"

"I know.
 So, um... See, Gilgamesh said it too, right? Magi take it from somewhere else if they can't supply it themselves."
She murmurs.

"...? He did say something like that, but what about it?"
"Geez! ...So, um, I have to do something about the insufficient part."

Tohsaka blushes furiously, her voice trailing off to a whisper.

"W"
I know.
I'm a magus, even if I may be an amateur.
I know what Tohsaka just said.

"TTohsaka, that's..."
"...There are only a few ways for magi to tune in, right? We're of the opposite sex and we don't have time, so it's the most efficient way since it's like a contract..."

So.
I'm going to have sex with Tohsaka to connect with her so that I can use her magical energy.

"...Ah, uh?"
My head explodes.
My memory of the past few days gets blown away once I think about what Tohsaka said.

It's Tohsaka we're talking about.
She's a female student I admired, recently got close to, realized her honor student appearance is fake, got attracted to her even more anyway, and my heart won't stop beating rapidly when I'm near her... So why did it turn out like this?

"...What? We're just going to be having sex. I think it's much easier than fighting with your life on the line."
Y-YOU IDIOOOOOOOT!!!!
PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE LINE IS MUCH, MUCH EASIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"H-HOLD ONNNNNNN!!
 That's strange. That's weird. You skipped too much. H-Heh, you won't trick me this time. You already made too much fun of me. I won't be fooled so easily!"

Tohsaka is staring at me.
Her gesture is more convincing than any words.

"Ah, guh"
My boiling head is heated up even more.
Tohsaka's gesture is so unfair that it deserves dozens of yellow cards in soccer.
"Guhhold on, hold on, hold on, hold on......!
 Why does it have to be that!? It's sex we're talking about! We're making love, we're making babies, and we're going to be embracing each other naked!? You can't do that with me!"
I blurt out with a broken head.
My hands are sweating and my vision blurs.
But still...
Even though that's what I'm saying, my body is going against my will.
I've been trying so hard not to notice, but I can't get my eyes off of Tohsaka.

Like her soft-looking breasts.
Like her long, smooth, black hair.
Like her shoulders that look slender and soft.
Like her gorgeous thighs coming out from under her skirt.
I'm fascinated by all of her feminine parts
"............"
She looks at me.
"Ahuhh."
...I know.
We should do this if it'll help us match Gilgamesh and keep Saber out of danger.
We're magi, so we shouldn't have to think twice about doing this to win.
But

I gulp.
I frantically restrain myself with my reasoning.

But still...
"......You don't want to do it with me, Shirou?"
Wait, why are you asking such an impossible thing, you idiot...!?

"That's not true...! There's no way I wouldn't want to do it with you!"
As I speak, I realize my own stupidity.
Tohsaka has to be embarrassed as well.
But she suppressed it to bring up the idea.
That's enough to kill me, so why am I making her say such a thing?


I take a deep breath.
I have to be calm.
If this is the last thing we can do, I have to prepare myself.

"I'm sorry. Let us do so if you'll let me.
 I shouldn't have panicked if that's the only way that'll let us beat him."
I stare back at Tohsaka, mustering all the courage I have.

"...I'm the one who should apologize. I didn't think you would dislike it so much.
 ...I should have explained to you in detail."
Tohsaka looks down awkwardly.
With that...

"No. It's not that I didn't want to."
I correct her even though I'm cornered.

"Huh...?"
"I'm saying you're wrong. I like you and it's not that I don't want to. I can't breathe because I'm so happy. This is like a dream come true."

"Butthat's exactly why I didn't want this to be for something like a contract."

My face is burning.
My face is burning hot, but I manage to say it.

"...Um, that's..."
"Yeah. I wanted to do it with you with nothing else in the way. So I thought this was unfair."

I said it.
I said it with a boiling head.
I can't think straight, but I'm telling the girl in front of me how I feel.


...Her stare is hurting me.
"............"
It gets awkward, so I look away from Tohsaka and scratch my cheek.
Then.
"Wha"
Something suddenly touches my lips.

"Heehee. I just kissed you."
"......!!!? T-T-Tohsaka...!?"
I quickly pull back.
I must have acted funny, because the one who kissed me...

"Okay. Then let's do it with nothing else in the way."
...Speaks with a smile that rattles my brain
"What is that?"
The first thing Saber sees after getting to the lake is a giant mountain of meat.

She is not a normal knight.
She fought many monsters back when she was called a hero.
She has even fought "dragons", considered the strongest of the fantasy races.
But even Saber falters against the mountain of meat.
It is not because of its ugliness.
It is because she can tell that the lump of meat and the curse flowing out of it are the same as her.

"A Servantcan a Servant turn out to be that different if the summoning is done in the wrong way?"
Or is that the power of the Holy Grail?
She stares at it and shakes her head.

"Rin...! Where are you, Rin...!?"
She runs to the lake and yells to the other side.
She is hesitant to enter the black mud.
It is not because it would be unpleasant.
Her instincts tell her that as a half-spirit, she cannot touch it.

"!?"
She hears a voice.
It is weak, but she hears her Master.
She looks at the mountain of meat and
"Rin......!?"
She steps forward without hesitation.

'Hold on...! No, don't come in, Saber...!'
"......!"
Saber stops.
She stops her feet and glares at the mountain of meat while holding up her sword.

"But Rin...!"
'Just don't...! You'll turn into this if you touch the mud. Please stay there and get ready to use your Noble Phantasm. This thing will explode soon. Use your Noble Phantasm on this before that...!'
Saber cannot nod to her master's words.
...She can tell that the lump of meat is about to hatch.
The squirms are turning into throbs and the mud is spreading ever further.

The lake has turned black, and the mud is spilling onto the ground.
...That thing is growing.
The world's restraining power will be activated if that thing is left alone.
It is natural for her to destroy it with her holy sword.
But to do that
"Please get out, Rin...! I can do it once you get out!"

'...Yeah. All right, I'll leave it to you. But go ahead and use it if I don't make it out on time.
 ...The contract between us will go away, but you should be fine if Shirou is alive.'
"Do not say such a thing...! I do not care. I can handle this curse"
Saber runs to the black mud so she can get to that lump of meat.
But her body does not move.
Her body stops when she tries to go near the lake.

"Rin, did you use the Command Spell?"
'...Of course. I can't let the only one who can destroy the Holy Grail die.
 I told you it's all good. I'll easily get out from here. You can rest assured and stand by with your Noble Phantasm.'

She sounds calm and composed, like always.
"Rin."
But it does not need to be said that it is just a bluff.
The island of meat on the other side...
There is nowhere for her Master to run.

"Yeah, right. Well, talk is cheap."
She murmurs while being surrounded by arms made out of the meat.
The situation is hopeless.
Matou Shinji was saved.
...She ripped off the blood vessels and nerves connected to the meat to let Shinji out.
One can say he's "alive", ignoring all the after-effects he may have.
No, he looks like he is just unconscious, so one could say that he is healthier than the girl carrying him.

"...The problem is after that. I guess it would be desperate if it gets its heart taken away. Will it let me go if I give Shinji back?"
She slowly moves while she stares at the numerous tentacles.
But there is no exit.
The tentacles are blocking the way out to the lake.
Even if she escapes the tentacles trying to swallow her, she will not be able to get past that wall.

"......Crap, my powers..."
She almost falls along with Shinji, but she desperately keeps herself up.
She went through the cursed sea and even performed neurosurgery to separate Matou Shinji from the mountain of meat.
She went as far as using her reserve magical energy that she hadn't used for ages, but

"...Guh... That idiot. He took too much of my magical energy without any reserve. ...I'm all empty now thanks to him..."
She bears the dizziness as she complains.
But she's not serious.

And it wouldn't matter even if she did have more power.
The tentacles around her are not moving because their target is standing still.
They should react right away once they find out that the thing in their body is poison.
Tohsaka Rin and Matou Shinji are alive because they do not have magical energy to be consumed.

"......! ...But I guess this is it... It's getting hard for me to stay standing"
Her vision becomes hazy.
Even though she has a foothold, she is still on the mud.
Her nerves are getting further infiltrated with each passing second.
She will become the new core of the Holy Grail if she falls down onto the meat.

But before that...
"...I'm sorry, Saber. You probably won't obey me, so I'll force you to do it."
She has one more Command Spell.
That's enough for her to order Saber to use her holy sword.

"......And I have to apologize to you too.
 I couldn't... save... Shinji"

'Just run. I do not want to hear such whining.'

"What?"
She stops her collapsing body.
That voice.
The voice coming into her head is definitely that of the Servant she has made a contract with.

"Wai"
There's no time to waste.
She knows his personality all too well.
He told her to run, so he must have done something that she won't escape unless she does as she's told!

"......!!!!!!"
She runs.
The arrows coming down from the sky are literally a heavy rain.
They destroys the tentacles, the ground, and everything in her path!

"Ah, ku!"
There is no time to turn back.
She runs full-speed while carrying Shinji.

"!"
She jumps into the lake.
The arrows have swept the black mud away to make her an escape route.
It is only for a short while, but there is only dirty water between her and the opposite shore.

"Hah, hah!"
She runs across the lake while carrying Matou Shinji.
She runs with all her might, mud splashing around her.

"Please, Saber...!"
Her magical energy replies to the yelling voice.
There is no need to check.
The golden sword mows down everything in its path with its overwhelming power.
The mountain of meat is cut in half and breaks down.
The black mud evaporates, and the light turns the lake into a flat field.

It is a waterfall of light that eliminates everything.
She looks for it inside the light.
The red cloak...
The knight that she first made a contract with, who came back to fulfill his role.

It is a waterfall of light that eliminates everything.
Bathed in the light, the swordsman accepts that her battle has ended.

"This is the end. My battle is over."
Who did she say that to?
The wielder of the holy sword is on her knees and watches the light with a flood of emotions.

The Holy Grail is breaking down.
The thing she sought, the thing that should have saved her.
She destroyed it with her own hands and finally realized her mistake.
One boy and one hero.
The man that got twisted at the end of his ideal was still a boy.

His regrets are so heavy that they cannot all be carried.
His crimes are so deep that they cannot be atoned for.
But there was something he did not give up on.
The knight in red finally arrived at an answer at the very end.
Thenshe has to move forward as well.
The end where she took her hands off of the sword.
She will run past that hill under her own will.

"The contract is complete. You are victorious, Rin."
The holy sword fades away.
She still has some magical energy left.
She can stay in this world if she pushes herself.
If she canshe would like to see what awaits them in the end.

"But that is not my role. Shirou has Rin."
Her body continues to disappear and the knight vanishes from this world as if engulfed by the light.

Like a brave gust of wind.
The king that sought the Holy Grail sets off for the hill of destiny without leaving a trail of memories behind.
"Hah!"
I oppose the longsword with a longsword.
The swords break each other and the shards are sent flying.

"Damn, do not"
A curved sword appears behind him.
"...Overestimate yourself, kid!"
But I pull out the curved sword by my feet faster than him.
And I swing it straight at him!

"!"
Gilgamesh retreats.
I close the distance at once, pull out a sword, and slash at him.

"Guh, why...!
 Why am I losing to a lowlife's sword...!?"
I crash my swords against the appearing Noble Phantasms.

"HaaHaa, haa, haa, ha!"
I'm not thinking.
My body and mind will fail if I stop.
That's why I will keep moving forward.
The instant I see his Noble Phantasm, I reel in the exact same one and swing it with all my might!

"Impossibleam I being cornered by such a sham...!?"

"Fuh, hah!"
The sounds of swords crashing echo through the area.
He cannot handle my attacks and has to destroy my weapon with his.

That will be the cause of his defeat.
He is the greatest heroic spirit, as he has over a thousand Noble Phantasms at his leisure.

But he is only an "owner".
He does not have one weapon, so he is not a "wielder" who can use his weapon to its maximum potential.

Even in this world, I am no match against any other Servants.
I cannot match the ultimate one even with infinite swords.
Gilgamesh must have the ability, but I do not.

Thereforethis is the only Servant I can match.
As we have the same ability, as we are both "owners", I am always one step ahead of him since my swords are there, ready to be used...!

"DamnDamn, damndamndamndamn...!!! I did not think I would have to use my sword against a lowlife like you...!"
Gilgamesh raises his hand.
The sword appearing behind him is the demonic sword, the only sword that does not exist in this world!

"I won't let you!"
"Gah!?"
I swing my twin swords.
The Kanshou and Bakuya I reel in slice off Gilgamesh's arm that tries to reach for his sword!

"Wha"
The weapons stop.
His arm and sword fall to the ground, leaving him defenseless.

"Haa!"
My body acts before I can think.
Confident in my victory, my limbs move to slash the king of heroes

"!"
He jumps back.
Barely avoiding the twin swords, Gilgamesh retreats still further.

"Kuhyou are stronger than me here...!"
Gilgamesh admits his defeat and tries to retreat.

"I won't let"
I won't let him escape.
I'll lose if he regains his composure. I have to settle the match right here!
"...You go, dammit!"

"Damn!"
He must have realized he will not be able to escape, as he pulls out a Noble Phantasm from behind him.
But I'm faster.
I'll surely

"Huh?"
"What
?"
Our voices overlap.
The change happens in an instant.

The light coming from the lake eliminates the hill of swords.
A great magical energy has smashed away the already-disappearing Reality Marble.

That's fine.
The match is settled.
I can beat this Servant by slashing him with my twin swords.
But after the Reality Marble is blown away...

A black void.
A void big enough to swallow a human being.
It appears before meright on Gilgamesh.

"What?"
Gilgamesh looks down at his body in astonishment.
...His body is being swallowed.
The golden Servant is swallowed by the void appearing on his body.

"Wa"
Did he want to say "wait"?
The void mercilessly swallows the Servant.
...There was no way for him to escape.
The void was open on his body.
There is no way one can escape something that is on their body.

"What was that...?"
I stand there, dumbfounded.
The void in front of me is shrinking.

...I don't know what this is.
But it seems Tohsaka and Saber were able to destroy the Holy Grail.
My only guess is that the aftereffect created the black void to eliminate Gilgamesh.

"......Phew. Anyway, now..."
Everything is over.
My twin swords disappear.
The magical energy in me fades away.
"Ohcrap."
And at the same time, fatigue assails me.
"...Damn. This is bad, I can't walk."
I want to go see how Tohsaka's doing, but my body will not move.
...Well, I'm sure she'll be all right since Saber went to go save her.
"Right. I guess..."
I can rest a bit.
And after I take a deep breath...
"What!?"
A chain wraps around my arm.

"......!"
I gasp.
The chain drags my body towards the void.

"Ah, kuh...!"
I put power into my body, but I can't resist.
My feet slide across the ground towards the void...!

"Kufool. Does it not know Servants cannot become the core......!?"
"You...!"

He's appearing from the void.
Buthis body has melted here and there.
So that void must melt everything it swallows......!

"Guh, damn...!"
I try to get the chain off of me, but it doesn't even budge.
This chain even restrained Berserker. It's not something I can pry off...!

"Ah, guh"
I'm being pulled towards it...!
I'll be swallowed like him if I go near that void...!

"Damn, are you trying to take me with you...!"
"Hah, I have no intention of dying...!!
 Stay right there until I pull myself out, you lowlife!"
"You..."
He's arrogant even in this situation...!

"Ohdamn"
But what can I do?
I can't get this chain off of me.
I'll be swallowed into that void along with him.
Even if I hold my ground, he'll pull himself out.

It means I'm going to die either way
If I'm going to die either way, I can't let him escape...!
"No way"
I wrap the chain further around my arm.
I grab onto the chain so that it won't let me go.
"Don't come out into this world again...!"
I don't resist the pull and throw my body into the void.
"Foolare you insane......!!!!?"
I roll down.
I fall into the eternal darkness while my body is being melted away.

A black mud that melts my skin, shaves off my flesh, and removes my bones.
My body is taken away and the soul called Emiya Shirou falls into the darkness.

Is it because the fall was so long?
I feel like I'm going up after a while, and...
I'm swallowed by a big, grail-like sun.
"......! Haa"
I feel dizzy.
I can't brace myself anymore.
...I'll die.
I can't endure it at the very end.
Should I loosen up since I can't brace myself?
If I do so, I should be able to push him back into the void

"Don't take me so lightly...! I won't let you take me with you...!"
I gather my courage.
Will my arm rip off first, will his chain rip off first, or will he come out first?
I don't care either way. I'll fight until the very end and die gallantly...!

"...Heh. You can do that if you wish, but dodge to your right before you do that."

"Huh?"
I turn around instantly.
I look back at the compound which has turned into a flat field.
At the same time, something passes by me.

"YouArcher..."
...The chain is released.
Looking like he saw something unexpected, Gilgamesh lets go of the chain.


I fall on my butt.
I sit there dumbfounded, and the void shrinks and disappears in front of me.

"That... was"
I can't stand up, and just look behind me to the flat field.
Dawn is near.
The one with the rising sun behind him is the knight in red.

"Damnshow-off."
I complain without thinking.
But I'm smiling happily for some reason.

"Heh. Well..."
I have nothing to say to him. I guess I'll stay quiet so I can sleep.

A golden field that is now deserted.
Seeing the knight standing there and Tohsaka running to him, I lay on the ground.
Tohsaka should say everything I want to say to him.

So I'll sleep for now.
We'll end up fighting if we see each other again, and I'm not used to parting with myself.

...And for the final time...
I engrave my ideal into my mind so that I won't forget it, and I close my eyes.

The land below him is like a wasteland he once walked on.
There is nothing here.
There is nothing, as everything was blown away from the mountaintop.
The battle has ended.

The battle for the Holy Grail has ended, and the curtain is about to fall on his battle as well.
He does not know how long it was.
But the accumulated wish that should have bound him forever is gone now.
The end quickly permeates into him and takes away his body's form.

"Archer...!"
He looks towards the voice.
She should not have the energy to run, but she is running with ragged breathing.
He watches it in silence.

"Haa, haa, haa, ha......!"
The girl that ran up to him looks up at the knight.

The red cloak fluttering in the wind shows no trace of what it used to be.
The cloak is cut everywhere, and his armor is cracked and torn.
His existence is weak.
Standing there haughtily, the knight begins to disappear from his feet up.

"Ar... cher..."
The rising sun is in the distance.
A golden light is emerging from the horizon.

"Too bad. Well, that's what happened. Give up this Holy Grail, Rin."
He must not have anything special to say.
The knight in red says trivial things.


That gets to her all the more.
The knight who is about to disappear is still acting like before.
He is her partner that she spoke cynically with, ran through the battles with, and trusted her back to.
She can declare that those days were "fun".

And it is still there before her eyes.
He has remained in this world to save her at the last moment.
He lost his Master and received the king of heroes' Noble Phantasms.
His body was disappearing, but he did not come to her and ask for help, and he instead watched over this battle.
And the end is in front of her.

"Archer."
The girl cannot think of what to say.
It is always like this for her at the most crucial times.
She loses her cleverness when it counts the most.

"Ha"
The knight smiles a bit.
He knew that from the start.
The clumsiness of the girl is a dear memory for the knight.

"W-What? You don't have to laugh at me at a time like this!"
She looks up at the knight.
"Oh, excuse me. It's because you look so terrible.
 I was just amazed at how worn-out we are."
He smiles while he talks.


She gets a lump in her throat after seeing his regret-free face.
The instant she wonders if he should really disappear...
"Archer. Form a contract with me again."
She says something she shouldn't.

"I cannot do that. I do not know if you will keep your contract with Saber, but I am not qualified for that.
 And I do not have a goal anymore. My battle ends here."
His reply is free of doubt and his will is strong.
His face is as bright as the rising sun, and how can she force him when he's making a face like that?

"......But! But...
 You"
'won't be saved'.
The girl swallows her words and hangs her head.
That is not something the girl should say. And it's not something that is solved by keeping the knight in this world.

"Man. I do not have any attachment to this world, but..."
It's troubling to have her cry.
For him, the girl always has to be a positive, indulgent realist.
He was always encouraged by her figure.
So he wants her to stay that way until the very end.

"Rin."
The girl looks up at the voice.
Her face looks cute, trying to hold back the tears.
Rather than expressing the attachment he feels, he looks at the boy lying in the distance.
"Please take care of me. I think you know, but I am unreliable.
 Please support me."
The knight says so as if it's somebody else's business.

Those are words of parting.
...The future might change.
If a girl like her stays with Emiya Shirou, the hero Emiya should not be born.
His words contain such hope.

"Ar... cher..."
...But even if it ends up that way, the already existing knight will forever be a guardian.
The boy and the man are two different existences.
They only have the same starting point, and he is an ideal that the boy dreamed of.

"!"
...There is no salvation available for this knight.
There is nothing to give to him, as he has already died and become a phenomenon.
She nods in spite of that.
She cannot give him anything, so she will give him her best smile.
He asked her to take care of him.
She smiles so that she can answer the trust he put in her.
"Yeah, I know. I'll do my best. I'll do my best so that he won't get twisted like you. I'll do my best so that he will be able to like himself...!
 So you should also"
forgive yourself.
She does not put it into words.
She looks up at the disappearing knight with a flood of emotions.

How much salvation did it bring?
After engraving the girl's smile into his memory with pride...

"I found my answer. It's fine, Tohsaka. I'll do my best from now on as well."

A breeze.
The knight has finally rested his wounded body, without waiting for the girl's reply.

"Heh. I never got to complain to you."
She wipes away her tears and talks to the one who is not there.
Her voice is clear, and the girl is standing firm again.
It is only natural.
She does not have time to be depressed after he made a face like that.
She says goodbye to the ground that the knight was standing on and runs to the boy laying on the ground.

Within the golden sunrise...
      The smile he had was like that of the boy.
Before that, there's just one more conversation.

Just as they exit the forest, and when the sky is beginning to lighten up...
Before they go to the church, she informs him of the fact she has kept hidden.

"I'll tell you right now. There is only 'one' of the pendant that you gave back to me."
She does not tell him what that means, and he does not inquire about it.
It is because such matters are unnecessary when they are about to face their greatest enemyCaster.

    The one and only pendant.
    The one he found in her room and returned to her.
    The one he found on that night and put into his desk.
    Now is not the time to ask about the contradiction.

"...That's all that I need to tell you.
 The pendant you found in my room is something Archer returned to me on the day you were attacked by Lancer.
 I thought he went and picked it up for me..."

The decisive battle is near.
       The tall church can be seen in the horizon.

Tohsaka says she wants to confirm one last time.
Our roles are already set.
Lancer will draw Archer and Saber away from Caster.
We will use that opening to attack Caster.

Lancer asks ironically if we would be able to beat her by ourselves. To that...
"...Yeah. I'm sure I can outwit Caster if I can fight one-on-one with her."
Tohsaka answers with confidence.

...I don't know what she means by outwitting her.
She didn't tell us even when we asked, so it must be a plan that will have a lower success rate if we know about it.

Then what I need to do is fulfill Tohsaka's demand.
With all my might, I will keep Kuzuki from protecting Caster.
If I need them, I will project his swords as many times as necessary.

...I close my eyes and dive inside myself.
The Magic Circuit inside of me is stable.
Magic beyond one's ability will destroy the caster.
Half of my body became numb the first time.
It was easy and nothing happened to me the second time.
There's no guarantee the third time will be the same, but I don't think it's a problem to project his swords.

My body is stable.
The Magic Circuit that was hard even to construct is easily activated now.
It's like there's a fake nerve behind my real nerves, and they are reversible with the push of a button.
I'm trying to convince myself that it's because I've gotten used to it.

I can easily prepare the swords.
Projection has become my primary weapon.
It's a big improvement over ten days ago.
It's not only my magic. My sword technique has improved as well.

"............"
The reason behind it...
No, I try not to think about the reason.
It's more important to beat Caster and take back Saber.

Asking myself stupid questions can come after the battle.
The headache gets stronger as I near the church.
It's just like when I was looking for Tohsaka, but I avoid thinking about that.

The morning light is gray.
The sun is blocked off by clouds, obscuring the dawn's brightness.
The sky above is gloomy.
The sky is more gray than black, and it reminds me of that time ten years ago.

It should rain soon.
An impure gray sky.
Beneath it stands that man.

"I knew you would come, considering your personality."
He stares at her with cool eyes.

Tohsaka doesn't say anything and stares back at him.

"So what is the plan you've prepared? You're not the type to come attack without one."
He sounds joyful.
To that, "Yeah. I'll be fighting you."
The spearman in blue answers as he appears next to Tohsaka.

"I'm surprised. You made a contract with a new Servant already?
 Man. I know I'm not one to talk, but you're pretty fickle. Switching sides may have been a good idea after all."
"!"

"...I don't care, Shirou. Don't let him provoke you."
She stops me, still staring at Archer.
...But it's obvious looking at her face.
She knows he's baiting her, but his words still hurt.

"...Heh. I didn't like you from the start, butit seems you're rotten to the core."

"Oh. Does betrayal irritate you, Lancer? And you're not even the one who got betrayed. How faithful of you."
"I'm not supporting the young lady over there.
 I just don't like Servants like you."

"A hero's pride, huh? ...Man, everyone says the same thing.
 Even Caster had such a ridiculous thing. What good is honor once you're dead?
 I honestly can't understand how you people think."

"You don't have to. I'll make it easy so you don't have to think about it."

There is no more need for words.
All that remains is the intent to kill, with Lancer's sharp and Archer's calm.


...They are about ten meters apart.
The confrontation of the knights in blue and red is just like that night.

"Lancer."
Tohsaka calls out to the blue back.

"You two go inside. I'll catch up once I beat him."
"...I know. But Lancer, Archer is..."
"Yeah, I'll go easy on him. I need him to crawl and beg your forgiveness."
He speaks without turning, grinning at Archer.

"Thanks.
 I'm glad you're the one who came to help us."

We go around the two as we head to the church.
The guard, Archer, lets us through unchallenged.
No, he has to let us through.

Archer is already confronting Lancer.
Lancer will pierce him if he lets us distract him.
He can either attack us and leave himself open to Lancer, or he can fight Lancer and let us go.
If he really is guarding this place, the choice should be obvious.

We run around the courtyard and open the door to the church without hesitation.
Behind us...

"Man, this is troublesome."
"What is, Lancer?"
"Well. I can't go easy after she makes a face like that.
 That's troubling, right? She's a great Master, but I'm not one that can readily betray my Master."

"...You are too easy-going, Lancer. Do you know the saying 'grass is always greener on the other side of the fence'?"
"Heh, what are you saying?
 There's no way I'd know such a phrase!"
"We don't have much time. We'll beat Caster before their match is decided."
"I know. Let's cut the talk from now on.
 Um, You're sure you're okay with fighting Caster alone, right?"

"Yeah. I'm sure I'll be thoroughly cornered, but don't help me. You can just concentrate on keeping Kuzuki-Sensei away as long as possible."
We go past the main area and head to the door leading to the courtyard.

I won't hesitate if Tohsaka says so.
...But I don't know if it's possible for me to back Tohsaka up, even if she's cornered.
My opponent is Kuzuki. I won't be able to dodge his attacks if I'm paying attention to Tohsaka.

Caster's presence is getting closer.
The church is filled with her magical energy as she must not be hiding her powers anymore.
I bet she already knows about our raid.

"Trace, on."
I carefully knit together the illusion using eight steps.
I'm getting the hang of it. His swords are in my hands within a minute.

"!"
I feel a light headache.
Even though I'm getting used to it, it takes a toll on my body.
Projection is damaging my body deeper than I realize.

"........."
"?"
Was it my imagination?
I think Tohsaka hung her head for a second.

We go down through the darkness.
We run down the stairs and come out into an open area.
And after that, we jump down into the temple like I did before.

"Oh. You guys are like monkeys, jumping down like that.
 I don't know why you're in such a hurry, but use the stairs if you're human."

We land in the temple.
This was supposed to be a surprise attack, but Caster greets us with composure.


Kuzuki Souichirou is standing next to Caster.
...I don't feel any enmity or bloodlust from him.
That's his battle posture. His clear murderous intent is hiding the scariness of that man.
In that regard, he's more like an assassin than Servant Assassin.

Saber is on top of the altar.
She's just like she was two days ago.
Saber hangs there, her head bowed.


I'm relieved we made it, but on the other hand, I'm worried about why she's so quiet.
I think Saber was in pain before.
She was shivering and gasping, resisting Caster's magic with all her might.
But she's dead silent now.

"........."
I have a bad feeling.
It's great that Assassin's not here, but if this bad feeling comes true, we won't get out of here alive

"I'm here, Caster. I thought about it thoroughly, but I've decided to have you eliminated.
 You're an eyesore, you get in my way, you annoy me, and I hate the way you look. You're like some backwoods hag with that purple robe of yours."

Tohsaka insults Caster, hoping to break her composure.
She slowly closes the distance between them as she talks, radiating confidence she probably doesn't feel.


...I shouldn't be concerned about Saber either.
Tohsaka is facing Caster by going counterclockwise, so I walk clockwise.
Caster and Kuzuki. If we are to separate them, we have to attack them from different sides and isolate our enemies.

"Heh. Letting you go seems to have given the wrong impression. Why are magi so reckless nowadays? No wonder Archer gave up on you."
Tohsaka's insults must have worked, as Caster is glaring at her.

I move while she does so.
I move to the other side of Tohsaka, to a place where I can attack Caster from behind.

Kuzuki watches me in silence.

......I thought so.
There's no way that this man would not notice our trick.
Kuzuki knows what's going on.
That we are trying to isolate our enemies and that Tohsaka has some plan.

Even with that in mind, he's letting Caster do as she wishes.
...It's not that Kuzuki is controlled by Caster.
He is acting of his own free will.
But stillhis passivity is like that of a puppet.

A Servant skilled in magic as the backup, and a Master skilled in hand-to-hand combat.
Their roles are reversed, and I think their natures are reversed as well.
Caster seeks the Holy Grail frantically, while the Master protects her without question.


That makes me think.
What if Caster was the Master and Kuzuki was the Servant who protected her? Maybe they wouldn't have fallen so low if that were the case.


Tohsaka glances at me.
It means our positions are perfect.
Thenthe match will be settled when either one of us attacks.
It doesn't matter if we get defeated or if Tohsaka beats Caster before that. Our fight will end right here.

"Well, let us start. This is the third time I've fought you. I'm getting tired of seeing your face, so I'll settle this right here."
Tohsaka takes a step towards Caster.

"You're talking big. I doubt this, but please do not tell me you honestly believe you can beat me.
 In that case, we don't even need to fight. I'll let you go again so that you can go fix that brain of yours.

"Of course I can beat you.
 Isn't that right? There's no way a first-class magus like me would lose to a third-class magus like you."

"I see. I guess it can't be helped.
 It seems I need to discipline that arrogant mouth of yours, little lady."

They get ready at the same time.
With a few meters between them, they act like mirror images.

That's the signal.
I attack the defenseless Caster...
"......!"
And of course, I'm stopped by Kuzuki.

...The ghost-like assassin is in front of me.
I can't spare any attention for Caster and Tohsaka's fight.
He knows what I intend to do.
He will not let me buy time.
Letting out the "snake" that even cornered Saber, Kuzuki Souichirou comes to take my life.

I can hold him off for a minute at most.
It should be the same for Tohsaka.
But originally, with our opponents reversed, we had no chance of victory.
Close-range fighting or magic, we have no way to beat our opponents who surpass us in skill.

But looking at it the other way, we can at least put up a fight.
Tohsaka would be killed in an instant if she fought Kuzuki.
I would be killed in an instant if I fought Caster.
In contrast, we might not be able to win, but we won't be killed in an instant with this match-up.

...So in other words.
This battle is not about how to beat one's opponent.
Instead, this is a contest to see how long we can hold off an opponent of superior skill.
The two weapons clash.
Twin swords and lance: the attacks are executed to take their wielders' necks.
There's no hesitation in those attacks.
Each strike is meant to kill.

Even Lancer makes no exceptions.
Even though he told Tohsaka Rin, his ally, that he would "go easy", that becomes secondary once the battle starts.
It merely means that if his lance happens to miss Archer's heart and if it does not kill him instantly, he will refrain from finishing Archer off on the spot.
Even in that case, his enemy will die in due time, but Lancer just needs to drag him to Tohsaka Rin before that happens.
Lancer does not care what happens after that.

"!"
The red demonic lance invades the enemy territory.
The lance breaks through Archer's defense each time it is thrust.
It is not like that night.
Archer cannot block Lancer's attacks now as he could then.

It is only natural.
This is their second battle.
Lancer was under the Command Spell's bind.
To learn his enemies' strengths, his Master told Lancer, "Fight against everyone. But do not defeat them. Survive your first battle against any opponent."
That is the only order he was given.
He has followed such an unreasonable command, and this is his first "battle without any binds".

Therefore, it cannot be like the last battle.
There is nothing binding Lancer, and Archer is now forced to fight the fastest heroic spirit.

"Guh!"
A strained voice escapes Archer's mouth.
Even his hawk-like eyes cannot follow Lancer's spear.
The lance's movement is a point to start with.
And it is a flash of light now.
He cannot discern the lance coming at him.
Even Lancer's movements are becoming invisible now.

"!"
He has been able to block such attacks until now because he had experienced them in a previous battle.
He is doing what he canusing his inferiority as a weapon to block Lancer's furious onslaught.
He is controlling where the attacks come.
The knight in red limits the oncoming attacks by leaving fatal openings.

Of course, he will die if he does not dodge the attacks.
But if he can choose between instant death and getting slowly cut up, he prefers to risk instant death.
Otherwise, it all will have been for nothing.
Fortunately, Lancer is still taking Archer lightly.
Or rather, he is lost in the joy of battle.
If they are to keep on assaulting each other like this, he can think of another thirty ways to "show an opening".

Prediction using the information obtained. Planning using cultivated battle experience.
Those are the nerves of steel, the "mind's eye" that one obtains through training.
This is nothing extraordinary.
This is the only skill he possesses.
It is not innate like Saber's "instinct", but it is a simple weapon that anyone can gain through hard work.


Lancer backs off and stops for a bit.
He looks the red archer over, as though dissatisfied.

It is obvious who is going to win.
Archer has no chance of victory in hand-to-hand combat.
No, that has been obvious from the start.
If Archer is an "archer" like his name states, this cannot be a match unless he's shooting from a long range.
But still, he blocked the attacks.
He is inferior and should not last a few more blows, but he blocked Lancer's full-force attacks.

Is Archer strong, or is Lancer going easy on him?
He laughs.
He already realizes that Archer is a mysterious Servant.
He can admit that Archer is strong in that regard.

Butit is unthinkable for Lancer to be going easy.
The first attack was aimed at the neck to chop his head off.
The second attack was aimed at the heart to destroy his body.
He cannot be going easy.
He shouldn't be, but
It is certainly true that he wasn't trying to kill Archer.

How does one know that this sort of fight is serious?
A battle between Servants is a battle between Noble Phantasms.
The fact that he is fighting Archer without using his is proof that he is going easy on him.
The reason behind it...
...Must be the "thanks" he heard earlier.
"Damn. Are you kidding me!?"

"Ku!"
"Gu!"
The weapons clash harder than before.
The two spring apart in a shower of sparks.
The full-force attack by Lancer is nullified by the full-force attack by Archer.

They are about five meters apart.
It is a distance Lancer can close in an instant.
"I don't get it."
The spearman in blue murmurs.

"You switched to Caster's side even though you are this strong? You and Rin would've had no trouble with Caster."
Lancer stops emitting murderous intent, but there's no opening in his stance.
At that, Archer smiles a bit.

"I'm surprised. You're still saying such things?
 Lancer. I chose the path that has the highest possibility of victory. I do not care what Rin thinks, but I am sure there is no better plan than this."
He speaks confidently, with no sign of guilt.
The knight in red shows no regret about betraying his master.

"I see. I guess it was stupid of me to ask."
Archer agrees.
Lancer snorts and slowly raises the tip of his lance.

"You are certainly good at fighting. Your tactics will get you through many battles.
 But that is not the right way. Your swords are lacking in pride."
His fighting spirit roars up.
Even faced with this, the archer in red still smiles.

"Fortunately, I do not have any pride.
 But what about it? Will the name of the hero be disgraced? Hah, do not make me laugh, Lancer. You can wash away disgrace with results.
 You can feed your meaningless pride to the dogs."

In an instant.
The slightly relaxed atmosphere changes.

The air freezes.
The magical energy to disturb the order of the world, the demonic lance that inverts cause and effect, is raised.

His murderous intent is incomparable to his previous ones.
Though the tension must make it difficult even to breathe...
"You said 'dog', Archer?"
The blue-armored spearman growls in a voice that could drive the crows from a battlefield.

"Yes, Cu Chulainn. If you have pride as a hero, you should get rid of it right now."
"Well said. Then you can die first."

Lancer jumps back a great distance.
It is no longer a matter of thrusting his lance.
There are over a hundred meters between them now.
Lancer leapt back to the entrance of the clearing and crouches on all fours like a beast.


Archer's senses freeze.
Is it fear or awe?
Either way, Archer understands right away...
The meaning of Lancer's retreat.
He knows that his enemy's next attack is literally a fatal attack.

"You know about Gae Bolg's ability, right?"
Lancer, with his limbs on the ground, raises his waist.
It's just like a sprinter waiting for the signal gun.


Archer has no reply to spare.
The knight in red throws away his swords and immerses himself in his own mind.
But will he make it?
Lancer's posture...
If his demonic lance is just like the legend, a Noble Phantasm to block it cannot be anything superficial.

"Here I come. Take this attack as your farewell gift...!"
The blue panther runs.
Even his after-image is a blur. Lancer speeds to Archer like a whirlwind.

There are a hundred meters between them.
Lancer is not going to thrust his lance using that whole distance to gain speed.
The blue figure crouches.
After running fifty meters in an instant, the spearman suddenly leaps up from the ground.

His body flies through the air.
He holds the demonic lance, said to always pierce the heart once it is thrust, over his head.
Space distorts.
According to legend...
That lance scatters numerous spearheads once it is released.
In other words...

"Gae..."
The lance of causality joins with the words to form a tapestry of action.
The spearman in blue arches his back as if drawing a bow...
"Bolg!!!!!!"
...And he smashes down the attack with a roar

...This Noble Phantasm is a throwing attack by nature.
A lance that never misses the heart.
A cursed Noble Phantasm that cannot be avoided and will attack the enemy even if it misses.
That is Gae Bolg, lance of destruction possessed by the hero that never lost in his lifetime.
As it is hurled using all of Lancer's magical energy, it can be neither dodged nor blocked.

Therefore, it is fatal.
There is no way for anyone to survive once they are targeted by the demonic lance...!!

The bullet approaches.
In a split second, the knight in red closes his eyes as if accepting his death...

"I am the bone of my sword."

The thorn of light blazes forth.
And right before the thorn of destruction coming from the heavens strikes Archer...
"Rho Aius!"
Its true name shakes the very air as it is spoken.

The lance crashes into the shield.
The lance of death that penetrates every wall and outmaneuvers any evasion.
That lance has been stopped.
Radiating a storm of heat, the lance of sure kill is stopped by Archer's "Noble Phantasm".
The seven flower petals appear from empty space and shield Archer from the demonic bullet!
Who would know?
This shield is Aius. The only shield said to have repelled the javelin of the great hero in the Trojan War.
There are seven barriers shaped like flower petals, and each layer is as strong as a castle wall.
It is a boundary field Noble Phantasm that is said to be invincible against projectile weapons.

A thrown lance will be defeated by this shield without penetrating even one of the petals.
At the very least, Archer does not know of a lance that can penetrate this shield.

But.
The lance of sure kill drills through the shields like it's nothing.

"......!!!!!"
The sixth petal is destroyed.
Only one remains.
The demonic lance reaches the seventh layer that has never been broken.

The unstoppable thorn of the demonic lance.
In the face of that power...
"NuNuaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......!!!!"
With a roaring spirit, Archer puts all his magical energy into the Noble Phantasm!


After landing, Lancer glares at the Servant in front of him.
...Archer has wounds all over his body.
His raised arm is barely attached.
His face is strained in pain, not only from the wounds on the arm, but also from the agony in his head.

"I'm surprised. I did not think there was a weapon that could penetrate the Aius.
 Your lance is stronger than the original Gungnir."
The knight in red praises the spearman in blue from the bottom of his heart.


But Lancer does not hear him.
His strongest attack.
The attack that made him a hero has been blocked.
He is so angry that his glare should be able to kill someone.

But the anger is almost erased by his wonder.
...This is too strange.
It is true that Archer is a mysterious Servant.
His identity is unknown, he carries twin swords even though he's an archer, and now he shows a shield that can even block Lancer's strongest attack.
It is absurd.
There is no such hero on this planet.

"Who are you?"
"I'm just an archer. Your analysis was not incorrect."
"Bullshit. An archer would not have a shield to block a Noble Phantasm."
"I guess you can, under the right circumstances.
 But this is the result. I used up most of my magical energy, one of my arms is destroyed, and Aius is shattered.
 ...Man, that was the greatest protection I had."


Lancer only glares at Archer.
Then.
"More importantly, have you noticed, Lancer?
 It seems Caster is in trouble. She is no longer supervising us."
Archer raises both his hands as if in surrender.

"...I see. I knew it. That was your intention from the start, huh?"
"Of course. I told you, right? I will only take the route with the greatest chance of success."
"Heh. I really do hate you."

Saying so, Lancer turns his back to Archer.
...His work is done.
His role of keeping Archer busy is meaningless now.
There is no more need for him to side with Tohsaka Rin.

The spearman in blue starts to walk away and
...Lays down on the grass to wait and see.
The sky is still gray.
We leave the now-empty church.

"Oh. So you guys are done, huh?"
...Then.
I see a familiar spearman in front of me.

"!"
Saber glares at him while supporting me.
She's so tense that she might slash him if he takes another step.

"...No, you're mistaken, Saber. He helped us."
"Huh...? Did Lancer help you, Shirou?"

"...Yeah. ...Don't fight him now if possible."
Saber stares at Lancer in astonishment.
...It seems he's enjoying Saber's reaction.

"I understand... but why, Lancer? Are you conspiring?"

"Huh? Oh, are you stupid? Of course I'm conspiring. I won't help someone unless I'm plotting something secretly."
Lancer's words are blunt.

"...Ha."
I knew he was that kind of guy, but he's thorough as he's making fun of Saber as well.

"Hm. What is so funny, Shirou?"
"Eh...? Was I laughing...?"

"Yes, you were. I guess I was mistaken. It seems I do not need to support you if you are well enough to laugh."
Saber is mad.
...It's bad, but I'm relieved.

Saber is just like before.
Our connection is lost, but she's here just like before.
Thenwhat's there to regret?

"...Sorry. I guess I let my guard down. Now's not the time, right?"

"No. We should rest for now even if we are to rescue Rin. ...Lancer, I do not know what your intention is, but your job should be over. Leave now. I will not fight you here."
With this, Saber goes down into the clearing.

"......? Hey, everything went wellor I guess not. What happened, kid?"
"Archer took Tohsaka. We're going to go rescue her."
Suppressing my dizziness, I meet his gaze and answer him.

"...What? Hold on, what's going on?"

...I'm sorry, but I don't have any energy left.
I'm not able to explain such a long story, I should go home and

"Archer's objective is to kill Shirou. He has abducted my Master, Rin, and requested a one-on-one fight with Shirou if we want her back.
 Her life will not be guaranteed unless we go to him within a day."

......Well.
It helps me out if you can do the explaining, but it does nothing to explain the situation to Lancer.

"Damn, he really did it this time."
...Then.
He takes off his friendly face and grits his teeth.

"...Lancer?"
"So, what? He betrayed that young lady not only once, but twice?"
"Uh... yes, that would be the case. What about it...?"

"This isn't the time for that. ...Damn, I've changed my mind.
 This was the only help I was going to offer, but let me help you a bit longer. I won't be able to have peace of mind like this."
Having said this, Lancer starts walking.


Saber watches Lancer silently.
...I understand how she feels.
He's saying that he'll come with us.

"...I say. What kind of magic did you two use to get him on our side?"

Saber sounds more shocked than amazed.
Unfortunately, I don't have the energy to reply, as my wounds are starting to hurt again.
...No, first of all...
I'm the one who wants to ask that question.
And I recall his dream.

The memory of the guy that was set up as a hero.
The story of a knight whose end came at a place I can't reach.

This hill is his world.
This desolate land is what the man who kept on fighting for others obtained.
I guess he smiled and died in satisfaction in this place.

"He's seriously stupid."
...That's right. It just makes me mad.
He tried his best, worked hard even though he's an ordinary person, and finally obtained a miracle with his blood.
Then it'll be a lie unless he becomes happy.
If he made many people happy, he should become happier than all of those people combined.

But he did not receive such a reward.
What he obtained in its place was the fate to be summoned as a "guardian" after his death.


That's right. Why didn't I realize that simple fact?
The guardians are summoned into every age.
Doesn't that conversely mean that they are summoned from every age?
From the present and the past.
Heroic spirits can even be summoned from the future.

Since guardians are pushed into a "seat" away from the time axis, the concept of time does not exist for them.
As soon as one becomes a heroic spirit, they sublimate into something other that what they used to be when they were human.
Then
It is possible for a guardian to be summoned into the place and age they lived in when they were alive.


It's vexing when I think about it.
It's because neither of them is saved.
The one that watches his previous self...
The one that watches his eventual self...
They will both be hurt by the gulf between them.

I know the end of this big idiot who tried to be of help to others.
He became a guardian by choice.
He thought that it would be great if he could keep saving people even after he died.
He could not save people when he was alive because he was powerless. But he believed he could avert every tragedy as a heroic spirit.

Thinking so, he made a contract with the world, gave his body after his death, and saved a hundred or so people.
He believed that he would be able to save more, tens of thousands of people, after his death.

But such hope was betrayed.
Heroic spirits are summoned only into hell.
They appear only when the world is about to be destroyed by people.
Humans are beings that will perish from their own doings.
So the process of destruction must always be the same.

He was summoned only into these "hells".
In the land of death where the ones he wanted to save were already dead, he killed even more humans.
The boy who stated he just doesn't want to see anyone cry...
...Could only see crying humans forever.

There's only one thing I can say.
He has been betrayed by many things.
And in the end, he was betrayed by the only thing he believed in, his ideal.

  I am the bone of my sword.
        Steel is my body, and fire is my blood.
        I have created over a thousand blades.
        Unknown to Death.
        Nor known to Life.
        Have withstood pain to create many weapons.
        Yet, those hands will never hold anything.
        So as I pray, unlimited blade works.

...That is the only spell given to him.
What is that?
I'm so mad that I want to hit him and scold him.

I, Tohsaka Rin, have never had any hardships in my life.
So I might not have the right to say it, but I believe in working hard and going through pain. It's wrong not to be compensated for your fights.
That's why I'm angry at his uncompensated life, and most of allI can't leave him be because he ended up cursing his life.

'You're my Servant, so I'm only going to do what I believe is right.
 I'm not as loose as Emiya Shirou, but I do have some things I cannot give up.
 I won't give it up no matter who's telling me so'

...That's right.
That's why I decided...
That as long as I'm his Master, I will believe in my path like he used to do.

That's about all I can show to him.
That's the only way I can repay him.
It might have been meaningless, but still...
I do it so that Archer, the one who lost his own past, can realize that his life was something he can be proud of

"Ah...... Hm......"
The first things I notice after I wake up are the sensations in my limbs.
They hurt and I can't move them.
"......I'm tied up."
I'm sitting on a chair and slept in a bad position.


...I don't want to admit it, but this is the worst possible situation.
I can't do anything.
My hands are behind the chair and restrained by something like handcuffs.
It goes the same for my legs, and I can't even stand up.
The handcuffs and the shackles are magic resistant, and my Magic Circuit is so messed up that I can't even create magical energy.


Now that I've checked my situation, I survey my surroundings.
...It's cold.
This room made of stone has no heater, and it is a ruin that hasn't been used in a while.
It's dark outside the window. ...From the looks of it, I think it's around ten o'clock at night.

"So. What do you intend to do, Archer?"
I glare into the darkness.
...By the pillar...
The knight in red is sitting on a pile of rubble.

"It's nothing. You're just bait to lure out Emiya Shirou. You should know that."
"...Heh. Shirou would come even if I'm not here. You should know that."

"You're right. But it would be inconvenient if you're there with us. I'll have you stay quiet here until the matter is settled."
Archer says so without appearing in front of me.
There's no sign of his previous friendliness.
He is a calm "cleaner" now.

"I see. So you will kill Shirou no matter what?"
"Yes. Such a soft person should die."
He answers as a matter of course.
I can only see the shadowed side of his face from here.
His expression is cold, and he looks like he has a mask on.
Thatmakes me seriously angry.

"...Heh. I know without being told that Shirou's soft."
I breathe in.
It'll end once I say this.
My Archer will never return once I say this.
I take a breath and glare at the guy in the shadows.

"But I love that soft part of him.
 He should be like that. I'm saved by having a guy like him."

"But what about you?
 You went so far, but you think that holding a selfish ideal is wrong?
 You fought over and over for other people, you got betrayed over and over, and you were forced to clean up after them over and over!
 Were you disgusted with humans after that, Archer...!?"

I get even more angry as I speak, and I'm screaming it out now.

...Archer doesn't answer.
The face in the shadow is a face I've never seen before.
'You cannot save everyone.'

When I heard this from the man I believed could save anyone, I felt resistance.

'Look, Shirou.
 A superhero can only save the people he has sided with.'

I didn't like those words either.
I didn't want the superhero himself to say these things.

...Since that time, Emiya Shirou's whole life may have been focused on overturning those words.
There's no need for sacrifices.
Nobody will get hurt if you work hard and do your best.
My father should have yearned for that as well.
So...

'YeahI'm relieved.'

...I cannot look away from his last moment.

Tohsaka told me such a life is unnatural.
...I know.
I realized that a long time ago.

There's no world where nobody gets hurt, nor can one seek happiness without hurting others.
Such a utopia does not exist anywhere in this world.
Emiya Shirou's search for superheroism is just hypocrisy.

'There is nothing at the end of helping people.'

So...
I know that without being told.

'It is a false life that can save neither yourself nor others.'

...Yeah.
Even if it may be true, I won't let you say it.

I don't care if anyone other than him denies it.
But I won't let him say it.
We have the same beginnings, and even if I may eventually become like himno, all the more if that is the case. That is why I have to deny him.
As he does not approve of the former Emiya Shirou...
I will not approve of him as long as I exist.

...Even if this dream may be a distorted one.
If I have believed in it and if I am going to believe in it, I


I wake up.
I look at the clock right away and see it's eleven o'clock right now.

"Are you awake, Shirou?"
Sitting Japanese-style, Saber greets me in a calm voice.
...It's been half a day since I came home from the church.
She must have watched over me ever since I fainted.

"Yeah, I'm awake. My body's fine. I'm not tired and my headache's gone."
I get up from the futon.
My limbs are fine now.
The Magic Circuit I overused is still exhausted, but it hasn't burned up.

"Are you going, Shirou?"
Saber suddenly asks.
The answer's obvious, so I silently nod back.

"...I see. Then I shall go with you.
 But, Shirou. Rin is my Master. It is my role to save her. I will stop Archer, so..."

"No, you got it backwards, Saber. I'll fight Archer."
I interrupt Saber.
She looks at me uneasily.
"...No, Shirou.
 Archer is your"
She hesitates to finish her sentence.

"I know. I've probably known who he was from the first time I met him."
I've opposed him without reason from the first time we met.
I stubbornly hated him, thinking that I could not approve of him.

...It's natural.
People can only look away when faced with their own mistakes.

"...Yeah. But that's why I can't approve of him. I have to settle my score with him."

I stand up.
My body feels great.
There's only half a day left until the deadline. ...I can't spend any more time resting.

"Shirou."
"...I don't have any right to say this, but please, Saber.
 I'll fight Archer. Don't help me, no matter what happens."
I bow as I ask Saber.

"There is no need to act like that, Shirou.
 I shall obey if that is your wish.
 I have sworn to be your shield. I shall observe your fate until the very end."


Her answer is perfect.
Her clear voice sweeps away the uneasiness within me.

"Thank you. It's reassuring to know that you'll be watching me."
"Yes. I am glad you are like that, Shirou."
She smiles back.
We're prepared for departure now.

We leave my house.
Who would have thought I would go to that castle again?

"Hey. You guys aren't listening to me, right?"
"Huh?"
"Huh?"
We both turn around.

...Oh.
Come to think of it, Lancer was still here.

"...Oh. You have more free time than I thought, huh?"
It just slips out.

"......"
He must be self-conscious, as he doesn't try to retort.

"Lancer. I do not know what you are planning, but there is nothing to gain from following us.
 Archer is a Servant without a Master.
 I do not think your Master would want to defeat such a person."

"I know, I know. I have no intention of fighting Archer. You can rest assured that I won't butt in on the fight."

"...Then why are you going to come with us? If you want to settle the match with me, I can do it right here."
"No, I'll pass on that. I have no intention of fighting against your Master. Rather, I want to sell her some favors. I want her to be in debt to me."

"........."
Saber glares at Lancer, and Lancer ignores her.

"Okay, do as you wish. We can use all the help we can get in saving Tohsaka."
"Shirou...! Lancer is an enemy. You cannot make such a rash decision"

"That should be all right. He's twisted, but he won't lie. First of all, he's not the sneaky type. He'd come fight us straight on before he would try to trick us."
"Hm... That is true, but..."

"Well, I'll turn him down if you don't want to. But he'll follow us even if we let him be. So isn't it easier for us to have him near us where we can keep watch?"

"Hmyou are getting better at making excuses, Shirou."
"Well, a lot has happened.
 Well, that's it, Lancer. We won't concern ourselves with you, and you don't bother us. Let's go together if that's fine with you."

I say to the guy that's watching us with a smile.

"Good enough. Wow, you guys are a great combination.
 Saber's stubborn, so I'm glad you're more mature now."

"T-That is not true! Shirou is the stubborn one. You do not know how much trouble I have been through!"

"What?
 Are you going to tell me if I ask? Fine, we have some time until we get to the castle. Let's entertain ourselves on the road with your stories."

"! W-Why do I need to explain such a thing to you? You have nothing to do with this!"
Saber roars at Lancer.

"......Wow."
I guess Saber doesn't get along well with Lancer.
But I never thought Saber would get angry like Tohsaka.

"Oh well.
 Let's get going. We don't have time to be playing around. We have to get to the castle as quickly as possible."
I leave the two and start walking.

"S-Shirou...! I am not playing around!"
She must still be mad, as she yells at me.
Lancer follows us from a distance.

It's midnight right now.
I know how far the castle is from here.
We should make it in time.

We'll probably get there around dawn.
We start to walk to the masterless old castle.

It is daybreak.
The knight in red is leaning against a pillar and staring at his arm.
Putting strength into his fingers, he makes a fist.
His body is only half responding.
Even heroic spirits cannot maintain their existence in this world without their Masters.
He still exists because of the special class ability of Archer, but he's almost at his limits.

His remaining strength is not even a tenth of his original powers.
His muscles are weak, and his body will slowly disappear if he loses focus.


But there's no problem.
Even if he has less than a tenth of his original power, it is enough to kill Emiya Shirou.
Considering the difference in their abilities, this isn't even a handicap.
Therefore, it will end once they fight.
His one and only objective will be accomplished here.


...That's right.
He has waited for this time.
He has endured the endless repetition hoping for this chance.
He has awaited a miracle that would not occur, a miracle with a probability close to zero.

And his wish was granted.
No, it is about to be granted.
...He does not care what awaits him afterwards.
He will kill his own self with his own hands.
The hopeless, futureless wish is what kept him going after he wore out.

"Was it long? Or was it an instant?"
He is an existence that disappears after each summoning.
His memory does not remain, no matter how many times he repeats the cycle.
It only stays in his body as knowledge.
Heroic spirits recognize other heroic spirits because of these accumulated facts.

It's just like a book.
Every time a heroic spirit is summoned, the book with its story is sent to its home.
The heroic spirit itself remains in the house, reading those books.
The trouble is that the one at the house does not know when those books arrived.

Past or future do not matter.
All the "books" are already in his room.
His only way of measuring time is to read the records of his "cleaning" that he will accomplish.

It makes no difference if it's eternal or instantaneous.
Eternity is instantaneous, and an instant is eternal.
Therefore, he does not know how rare this miracle is.
He does not know if this is the first time or the thousandth time since he obtained this hope.
...All he has is unordered knowledge.
Past, present, and future are meaningless for heroic spirits.

"...A guest, huh? I chose this place because I was told there would be no interruptions here."
The knight in red suddenly gets up.
Did his ears hear the sound of the intruder?
Footsteps echo through the silent castle.

"Wow. I'm surprised, Tohsaka. I was dubious, but you really are here."
A voice echoes.
The rude intruder is a boy called Matou Shinji.

"Oh, don't do anything violent, okay?
 I don't have any business with you. You have no business with Tohsaka either, right? Then isn't it meaningless for us to fight here?"
Matou Shinji walks forward with light steps.
He is looking at Tohsaka, who is tied up.
The girl glares silently at the intruder.
That must delight him.
He licks his lips in satisfaction and walks to the girl.


"What?"
Stared down by the knight, Matou Shinji looks up in annoyance.
"What, you want to fight me? Are you serious? You'd be no match for me!"
He smiles and turns back to the entrance.

There stands a man with golden hairthe eighth Servant, Gilgamesh.
He is, literally, a disaster.
The golden Servant looks at the knight with cool eyes.
But within them...
The red eyes only show the intent to brutally kill the enemy in front of him.


The knight in red is still silent.
It makes no difference even if Matou Shinji appears or if the strongest Servant is ready to attack him.
The knight calmly stares at the uninvited enemies.

"Haha. You're scared, right? It's nothing to be ashamed of. He even killed Berserker. It's natural for you to be scar"
"Do you want Rin, Matou Shinji?"
"Huh...? Y-Yeah, of course. There's no other reason for me to come to this castle."

"I see. Then wait until this is over. I will give her to you after I kill Emiya Shirou.
 She is mine until then. It cannot be helped if you cannot compromise on that. It will be regrettable, but you will die here, Gilgamesh."
The knight's eyes remain on the golden Servant as he speaks.

"Very funny, you fool."
Were those words reason enough for the man to kill Archer?
The golden Servant identifies the knight in front of him as a target he must kill.

"Oh. Hold on, Gilgamesh. Don't be rash, and let's be smart. Come on, he says he's going to give her to me, so I'll let him.
 Archer doesn't have a Master. I'm sure no Master would make a contract with a Servant that betrayed so many people, so he'll disappear if we let him be. I can take Tohsaka after that."

Matou Shinji smiles and stares at the knight in red.
It looks as if he is enjoying the fate of the one who is about to disappear.

"You're smart, Matou Shinji. That's an intelligent decision. You are a most fitting Master, in a sense."
"Oh, you show promise! How wasteful! I would've made a contract with you if you came to me!"
Stepping away from the knight, Matou Shinji claps his hands happily.

"But I'm sorry. I don't need any more Servants. It's unfortunate, but you'll have to disappear."
"You do not need to tell me. So what will you do? Will you fight me, or wait until I disappear?"

"Yeah, I'll wait. You're pretty decent, so we'll protect Tohsaka until you kill Emiya.
 But, yeah. That thing is mine already, right? Then I can do anything to her, right?"

He stares at the knight and Tohsaka Rin with snake-like eyes.
His words are to test the loyalty of the knight.
To that...
"I have promised Emiya Shirou that she will not be harmed. But that promise is over at dawn. You can do as you wish when the time comes."
The knight in red replies in an emotionless voice.

"HaHaha, hahahahahahahahahaha!
 Did you hear that, Tohsaka!? Your Servant is selling off his Master!"
Sneering laughter echoes in the dirty room.
The knight exits as if he's not interested.



Archer passes by Gilgamesh.
Archer ignores his mocking gaze and walks into the hallway.
At that instant...

"Faker."
The king of heroes says so as if despising him.
"!"
The same swords, the same techniques clash.
My attack and his attack are the same.
But still, the blades chip away and my body is wounded the more we fight.

The attack that I blocked breaks through.
Kanshou in my left hand is destroyed by his Kanshou and his weapon sweeps at me from the side.

"Haguhhh...!!"
I twist my body to dodge it, but it still slashes me.
Although not immediately fatal, the wound will eventually overcome me.

"Damn......!"
I bear the pain by cursing and swing Bakuya at the close enemy...!

"Wha"
It's blocked and destroyed as well.
We have the same swords and the same techniques, but there is a gap that I cannot fill.

"Did you think my Kanshou and yours are equal? Your assumptions of the basic structure are too weak.
 Even if you get the appearance and the composition materials down, it is a matter of course for it to be destroyed if the structure is not reasoned out. Even an image falters if it is illogical."

My temple and my side.
He attacks both my vital spots at once.
"Ah!"
I immediately "project" the twin swords and parry the attacks!

"!"
My head hurts to the point of blurring my sight.
It's not because of the strain of immediate projection.
This is that headache.
The instinct I felt when I was searching for Tohsaka.
The slight fever I got every time I faced him.
That strain now threatens to drive me mad

"Haah, ah!"
I parry his attacks.
I step in and slash at his body.
The red headache burns my eyes every time I do so.
Is it because of the contradiction that Emiya Shirou and heroic spirit Emiya are existing at the same time?
Ever since we recognized each other's identities, my body breaks every time we touch each other.

I traced his sword technique and even his reproduction ability.
It's natural for them to suit me.
His abilities are Emiya Shirou's optimal technique, perfected over many years of training.

There's no way it would not suit me.
In trying to match his skill, I allowed myself to learn too much about my future self.

"Ahguh!"
My eyeballs go numb.
Every time I swing the sword, every time the sparks fly out, I'm attacked with a flash so strong that it could blind me.

I am no match for him, and my vision fills with red every time we exchange blows.
If that's the worst of it, I don't care.
My body is already torn apart.
My headache is nothing compared to the burning wound in my stomach.
The problem is that the headache won't stop because there's something I'm still drawing out from him

"That's the fifth one. You should be nearing your limits of reproduction using projection. I know your magical energy capacity. You have three more. ...Even though I showed THAT to you, you still misunderstand."

His scornful voice contains some disappointment.
Misunderstand...?
I don't care about that.
More than anything, I have to do something about this headache right now.
The thing flowing from you

"Well, it will be impossible for you even if you arrive at that. It is not enough with the magical energy you can generate right now.
 Yes, either way"

My headache gets worse.
He raises his twin swords to finish the match.
"You had no chance of victory to begin with!"
He swings them down in a cross.

"!"
The swords I blocked them with are destroyed.
My body becomes numb as if a hammer had been smashed on it, and the headache finally sears my brain as well as my eyes.

It's flowing into me.

So...
    This is...
        Scarier...
            Than the pain.

This is his memory.
The reason he changed so much.
I can see bits and pieces of what will happen to Emiya Shirou in the future.

I don't know if it was correct or not.
Nobody will be able to determine that.
The beautiful things were ugly and the ugly things were beautiful.
There is nothing disgusting, once you look at it objectively.
So why is there such a deviation?
Sophistry, falsehood, trickery, vanity.
Those are what he saw the most.

;     I am the bone of my sword.

...But still.
It seems he did not care.
There was an ideal and an oath he had to protect.
He did not care what he lost to do so.

  Even when he was betrayed, he believed there would be a next time if he did not betray himself.
He did not show grief or pain.

;     Steel is my body, and fire is my blood.

He is like a cold-blooded machine to others.

He was a convenient existence, so he was conveniently used.
He was only a tool in other people's eyes.
But the machine had an ideal it wanted to protect, so it accepted its role as a convenient tool.

;     I have created over a thousand blades.
;             Unknown to Death.
;             Nor known to Life.

It's not something to go around proclaiming.
The more he kills and the more he is unable to save, the less he can talk about his ideal.
The only thing left for him is to obstinately protect his ideal until the very end.

And the result...
The ideal Emiya Shirou dreamed of has never been accomplished, and he found out that it's just nonsense dreamed by a fool who is only a nuisance to others.

;  Have withstood pain to create many weapons.

   See, this is his end.
   See, this is your end.


My mind gives in.
I won't feel compassion.
I won't feel compassion.
I won't feel compassion.
I won't feel compassion, but...
My mind almost gives in, thinking that I will be following this exact path.

  Yet, those hands will never hold anything.

What you believed in.
What you believe in.
You're shown that it is just a fantasy that is covered with lies, and still

"!"
His weapon closes in.
A horn-like sword comes to pierce my heart...!

"Guh!"
I get away.
I have in my hands the twin swords I quickly projected.

"HaHaa, haa, haa, ha!"
I force down my nausea.
Whatwas I seeing?
Forget it.
Forget what you just saw.
You need to defeat him. You should focus everything on that goal......!

"I guess it's a miscalculation.
 I've heard of magic that lets you acquire skills from the past by possessing yourself with a previous self... It seems your skills improve the more you fight me."

"Haa, haa, haa, ha"
My shoulders heaving, I prepare myself for his attack.

"Then my projection shouldn't be the only thing you got from me. That face. Seeing that nasty face of yours, you saw it too, Emiya Shirou?"


My breathing stops.
Don't let me say it.
Don't let me recall it.
If you say what I just saw, I...

"Then it is simple. It's all true, Emiya Shirou."
His red cloak moves.
He closes in on me in an instant and thrusts the horned-sword!

"......!"
It's destroyed in one blow.
There's no way a hastily-constructed sword, and a first attempt at that, would match his sword!

"Fuh!"
But.
Even though I'm empty-handed, he throws away his sword.
He projects Durandal, the renowned sword of the king

"Haah!"
I skip about four steps and quickly reproduce his weapon.
But of course, such an imitation is destroyed in one blow


I fall.
I'm repelled, and I land with my back on the rubble.

"Ahkuh."
That surprises me.
The rubble turns red just by having me fall on top of it.
...Oh.
I already know, but it seems my body is almost dead, outside and inside.

"This is it, Emiya Shirou.
 Your foolishness for coming here when you know you won't be a match, a mindless imitation, imprisoned by a stupid ideal.
 Do you understand that those are your true identity?"


His voice echoes.
My body is covered with wounds.
It's bad how the wounds are so deep that I can reach inside them and take out my bones.

"There is no value in such a life.
 I'm sure of it. There is no value in Emiya Shirou's life.
 ...It is wrong to save just because you want to save. You are a fake that should have never existed as you are broken as a human being."


My magical energy is almost depleted.
Not only that. The Magic Circuit to run the magical energy is burned up.
...No. If I talk about it burning up, it burned up yesterday when I used projection.
It's just that an almost broken thing completely broke.

"Ha
"
But my body is telling me I can still fight.
My mind bluffs itself, saying that it has not given in.
"Oh."
Then...
I have to get up and defeat him.

"It's useless. I am your ideal. You should realize that you cannot match me."
"HaaHaaHaa"
...I focus the last of my will on the Magic Circuit.
"!"
My split nerves scream.
But I carefully put together the eight steps.

"Trace, off."
I project his twin swords.
Kanshou and Bakuya, two great swords named after an ancient swordsmith.

"Fuahhhhhhhhhhhh!!"
I swing them.
I keep attacking until my remaining energy runs out...!
My twin swords are met by twin swords.
Archer now holds Kanshou and Bakuya and parries my attacks without retreating.
"I see. It's natural for you not to accept it.
 As I am your ideal, Emiya Shirou must not accept me more than anyone."

His calm tone pisses me off.
I can't even breathe, but he is calm and composed.

"Damn!"
I attack with all my energy.
"Damn."
He does not parry my attacks, but pushes them back.
"Hakuh......!"
...I'm pushed back along with my twin swords.
The difference in our powers is obvious.
There's no way for me to win with pure strength
"Hehthen let me ask you, Emiya Shirou.
 Do you really want to be a superhero?"

For an instant...
My mind blanks out from the surprise attack.

"WhatI don't want to become one. I'm going to become one...!"
I glare back at him.
Then...

"Yes, you need to become a superhero.
 Because that is your only emotion. An emotion you can neither betray nor deny.
 Even if that wish is not born from within you."

He stops me with words that grab my heart.

"Wha"
...Not born from within me...
I deny them even before I think about what those words mean.
I can't let him finish.
I can't realize that fact.
If I find out, Emiya Shirou's foundation will crumble.

"Oh. It seems you have a vague idea of it.
 No, you knew it, but you tried your best to keep that fact from yourself. I cannot even remember now."

"St"
I start to say before I stop myself.

I don't want to know.
I know that I shouldn't know.
But stillI know that I must know.
The contradiction of Emiya Shirou.
The answer to what is wrong with me, and how I am distorted.

"I do not have your memory anymore.
 But I still remember that scene. The flame filling my vision and the smell of death. The request for help and how I felt when it was granted. The look of relief on Emiya Kiritsugu's face when he saved me."

I realized that it is natural to die, and my mind emptied out.
I was saved at that time.
The man who saved me smiled with tears in his eyes.
That...
...Is what I thought was beautiful.

"That's right. It's not that you felt guilty for being the only one saved.
 You just admired Kiritsugu.
 You wanted to become like him only because he looked so happy when he saved you."

......That's right.
It's not me that got saved at that time.
It's an assumption I did not even think about.
If... if that fire was Kiritsugu's fault, he shouldn't have been able to bear that fact.

A tragedy without any survivors.
Kiritsugu, the one who caused it, must have frantically searched for a survivor.
And he finally found a survivor that should not have existed.
The man found a surviving child that could not be saved.
If you talk about miracles, it is...


But I knew about that already.
I don't care about his circumstances.
It was enough for me that he got me out of that hell.
Even if it may have been for himself, it's true that he tried to save me and wished for my survival.

...That's enough.
Emiya Kiritsugu saved a boy who had nothing.
So

"Yes, it's natural for a child to admire his parent. But you went too far.
 It would have been fine if you just admired what Emiya Kiritsugu wanted to become.
 But he left you a curse at the very end. I do not even need to say it, right? That is everything for you."

   'I'll make your dream...'

...That's the answer.
Hearing my casual remark, he left the words 'I'm relieved' behind him. And then that man, who was emptier even than me, died.
At that moment, Emiya Shirou had to become a superhero.

My will does not matter.
For his sake, I simply tried to become what he had admired since he was small.
The wish for everyone to be happy...
...Is an impossibility dreamed not by me, but by Emiya Kiritsugu

"You should know, Shirou.
 Your ideal is borrowed. You are only imitating what Emiya Kiritsugu wanted to become, what Emiya Kiritsugu thought was right."

"That... is..."
I grit my teeth, desperately trying to resist my mind that is about to give in.
But...

"A superhero? Do not make me laugh.
 Over and over, you said you wanted to help people. But that wish is not your own.
 You are conceited to think that such a man could help anyone!"

He attacks with his swords.
With the weight of his contempt behind them, the twin swords are swung more strongly than ever before.

"Oh."
Seeing those raging swords...
I accept my own death, just as I did ten years ago.
The force comes smashing down.
There is no elegance in those attacks, and they are executed only using his strength.
"Haa"
My left arm shakes from blocking the attack.

My fingers that held onto the sword break.
The sword I made using all my remaining power is bent back by one blow.

I'm dead.
I'm on the verge of death from the first blow. So there's no way I will be able to block the next attack.

"Oh."
But still...
My mind is about to give in, but my body denies it with all its might.
It's telling me I'm wrong.
It appeals to me, saying it's wrong to give in to his words and to die here.

I raise my head.
My eyes aren't functioning.
They don't see the enemy, but show his memories.
...In them...
I see myself curling up and desperately trying to live.

...The echoing of the swords isn't all I hear.
He...
He curses himself every time he attacks.

"That's right! I admired his desire to save people because it is beautiful!"

I block the oncoming attack.
Bakuya is destroyed. All I have left is Kanshou in my left hand.

"But none of that feeling is my own. What else can you call it but hypocrisy!?"

Kanshou is bent and its existence is fading.
...My heart is hurting.
Not because of his attacks. His words slash at my heart.

"I was driven by my obsessive need to help someone.
 I kept running, neither noticing the pain nor how wrong I was!"

He keeps denying himself.
My heart tries to give up every time I hear him.
My body wants to succumb to the force of his attacks.
But still...
That same body keeps desperately denying him.

"But it's all a fake. Such hypocrisy cannot save anything.
 No, first of all, I did not know what I wanted to save!"

"Gah!"
I'm smashed away.
An attack as strong as one of Berserker's easily flings away Emiya Shirou's body.


But I still hold my ground.
I frantically endure the attack coming down at me.
I will not be able to get back up if I fall down.
So my body refuses to let me fall.

"Ahhaa, ah, geuh......!"
I thrust the rapidly-fading Kanshou into the ground and lean on it.
My body sags forward, and I cannot even stand upright.

"Haah, haa, ha......!!"
I use Kanshou as a cane and hold up my falling body with my arms.
I must look pitiful.
I might look as if I'm kneeling down and begging him.

"That ideal is a failure.
 The idea that everyone else is more important than yourself, the wish for everyone to be happy, is all just fantasy.
 If you can only live by holding onto that ideal, drown in your ideals."

He says that...
There is no value in living, no, in my life itself.

"........."
My weapon is about to disappear, and there's little point in trying to keep my body from falling.
In contrast, he isn't even scratched.
The match is decided.
No, the match had been decided from the start.
There is no way for Emiya Shirou to beat heroic spirit Emiya.

...But that is a mistake.
If the difference in our powers was large, the fight wouldn't have turned out like this.

It is my mind that lost.
My mind was weak because I realized that I am wrong and that he is right.
That was my only failure.
Because

"...........Shut up."
"What...?"

Becausemy body has been telling me I will not lose to you.

Why?
Why did power enter my body every time he cursed my ideal as fake?
"Shut up, dammit......!!!!"


I'll reach it.
I'll definitely reach it.
If parts of me are broken, then I just need to use the parts that aren't.
If everything I have is broken, then use the parts I don't have.
If my body hasn't lost yet, I can just reach out to the part of me that hasn't been used yet!

A headache.
An instant of a few milliseconds. I see him, probably for the last time.
I could not understand him.
But I guess I can use his pain as a lesson.

...A hero who used a poem about himself as his spell.
Even if I don't understand the meaning behind it...
I will accept those words in your place.

", I am..."
I start the spell so that I can be proud of myself.
Emiya's words hurt Emiya.
He accepted that fact and chose to kill me.
That's the only thing he could wish for in the end.

Then...
Just as you deny me...
I will defeat you with all my powers!

"I am the bone of my sword."
I murmur the words without realizing it.
I raise my head.
I pour determination into my dying body.
I swallow the blood clotting in my throat.
Yang-sword Kanshou regains its image.

"You..."
"That's right. I already knew that..."
...This is just a dream.
But I kept on believing in it because I thought it was right.
Kiritsugu pursued it because he knew it was an unattainable dream, an impossible ideal.

Even if it may be unattainable...
He believed that he would reach his destination if he kept running.

"Her sheath...! Its protection is still there, even though the contract does not exist anymore...!"

I ready my sword.
I don't care about that.
I...
"I won't lose to you. I don't mind losing against someone.
 But I can't lose against myself!"
I will keep on being Emiya Shirou!
It is an unbelievable technique.

"Nu!?"
His attacking body is on the verge of death.
His fingers are broken, his limbs are slashed, and his breathing has stopped without him even realizing it.
His speed is nothing, and his attack is mediocre.
The boy that has absorbed his combat skills to the point where he's able to fight decently, has now returned to fighting without them.

An unskilled, frantic attack.
...But still...
This blow is heavier than any that came before.

"What?"
Archer's indifference turns into surprise within a second.
The swinging swords are crazy.
They clash against his longsword with unimaginable speed.

Where is his power coming from?
The attacks are unlike before.
"You!"
He cannot go into defense.
This attack should cut through the boy's neck.
Realizing that he cannot make light of the boy, he swings his sword.

Up and down, left and right.
The four attacks are enough to cut off his limbs and to cut up his body to pieces!

"............!"
The boy blocks them.
No, exceeding his four attacks, the sword comes to slash his neck!

"!"
Bringing back the longsword, he parries the attack.

"You...!"
He intuitively understands that he will be killed unless he attacks.
The longsword attacks the enemy that is on the verge of death, and the boy frantically swings his sword.
Their swords crash in balance.
The space is filled with sparks, and anything entering the space should be cut to pieces.

But it should be the last spark that a dying man gives off.
The boy loses his breath every time he attacks, almost falls, holds his ground, and attacks again.


The sight reassures him.
There is no power left in his enemy.
The boy in front of him is literally on the verge of death.
So...
So why do those arms have seemingly infinite power?

I have no consciousness.
I can neither tell what the enemy's doing, nor if my attacks are doing anything.
My muscles are screaming for oxygen, and the lack of blood keeps ordering my body to stop.
I suppress them altogether by force.
".........isn't..."
That's all that's filling my head.
My ideal is fake. He's right. I can't be a superhero.
As long as I admire such a thing, I will end up like the man before me.
"......It isn't......!"
But I felt beauty in it.
I know it's just hypocrisy to value everyone else over yourself.
But still...
I admired it, thinking how great it would be if I could live that way.
That's the only thing driving my dying body.
"!"
He cannot hear what his enemy is saying.
His enemy's voice is weak, yet his attacks are relentless.
Looking, the boy's hands are one with the sword's hilt.
It must be to keep the sword in place, but that will transfer the impact directly to his body.
The boy is covered in blood, and he will fall forward and die if he retreats.
Even swinging the sword should come with great pain.


He blocks it in annoyance.
His dying enemy gets on his nerves, but...
He himself gets on his nerves, because even though he knows it will end once he retreats, he is not able to do so.

But how can he retreat?

Straightforward attacks without strategy.
If it is a shame to turn his back to such attacks, it is also a disgrace not to block them.
His enemy will self-destruct once he retreats.
But he has a presentiment that he will lose something important if he does so.


The worries will end soon.
His enemy is at his limits. He will fall after two more blows, or three at most.

"Damn."
He clucks his tongue at the stupid thought.
He previously thought that his enemy would last two more blows. But he has received over ten blows since then.
The boy will not fall.
"............!"
He cannot hear the boy's voice.
The dying boy frantically opposes the obstacle in front of him.
That figure...
He stares at the figure with his own eyes for the first time.
I keep swinging the sword with arms that are about to tear off.
The only thing I have left is this one thing I'm saying with all my might.
".........isn't......!"
My barrage of strikes are compensation for that scream.
...There were people that could not save others, and there was me who could not save them.
I swore to myself never to let such a thing happen again, seeing the memories that meaninglessly disappeared.
"......It isn't......!"
How long has it been since then?
There were things I lost, and there were things I dropped.
There are always things that will be forgotten.
So I swore to myself never to forget this one fact.
To become a superhero.
I will protect it even if it isn't my wish, or even if it is just sophistry to soften my guilt.
It has to come true...
The person who saved me died, leaving those words behind.
I believe in the wish contained in those words.
Even if everyone in this world disagrees with me, and even if I myself curse me, I
And so...
He realizes that the attacks will not end.
His enemy will not stop.
He will not stop from his own will.
The boy is attacking with all his might, but he is not looking at his opponent.
The thing the boy is trying to defeat is his obstacle, his own self that is hindering himself.
He is swinging his sword to enforce what he has believed in, what he will keep on believing in.


Realizing that, the man grits his teeth in annoyance.
The boy keeps challenging it, knowing that he won't win and that there's no meaning to it.
That is the exact mistake he has detested.
So why...?
Why does he want to see how long the boy can continue?

"......! This is it, disappear!"
He raises his longsword.
His enemy's attacks are something he has to take seriously.
He repels the attacks and crushes his enemy's skull for sure.

A clanging sound.
The fatal attack is easily deflected.
The one who could not block his attacks until now repels a swing made with all his might.


He gasps.
He sees his enemy repel his sword and get back into stance.
The boy's eyes are...
...Looking straight at

The impact causes one of my arms and legs to break.
My sense of pain hasn't been numbed.
I use my fury to clamp down the pain that almost makes me wet my pants.
I don't have enough water. I can't release excess things.
The left side of the enemy's chest is open. Since half my body has broken, this will be my final blow.
But such thoughts do not fill my head.
The only thing in my head is...
He pulls back his longsword to protect his open left side.
He will make it.
He will easily make it.

This is my final blow.
"......It isn't a mistake......!"
That's the only thing in my head.
Even if Emiya Shirou is a fake, this is absolutely true.
For everyone to be happy...
That is an ideal everyone thinks of.
So I won't back down.
Because this dream is...
The unwavering gaze.
   Faults and lies,    shaking off everything,    running without stopping

"It isn't a mistake......!"

Those words are driven into his chest.
An attack made at full strength, defense that should have been fast enough...
The cogwheels never got into gear and the battle is decided quickly.


He hears the sound of the blade piercing him.


The one surprised is the knight in red.
His enemy attacked with determination to defeat him.
Then it is natural for his attack to do so.
The boy does not need to be surprised, nor does he have anything to spare to be surprised.


That is why the knight is the only one that is surprised.
It is a great wonder how he could not block an attack he could have easily blocked.

I support myself with my unbroken right leg.
The sword in my hand has pierced Archer's chest.

"Archer, why...?"
...Was she watching all this time from that place?
Still standing at the entrance, Saber questions Archer.


Archer does not answer.
He might not need to answeror maybe he doesn't know the answer.

"!"
My fingers throb.
My broken fingers scream at me that they do not want to hold the sword anymore.


...The knight in red does not move.
Even with a blade in his chest, a Servant should be able to easily counter-attack.
But his hands are lowered and show no sign of moving.
I know without being told what that means.

"I won, Archer."
I make the declaration while looking at him.
The knight in red closes his eyes once, and...

"Yes. And I lost."
He murmurs while looking off into the distance, as if to convince himself.
I pull out the sword.
The projected weapon disperses as soon as it touches outside air.

"Ah
guh."
The tension floods out of me, and I finally take notice of my condition.

"......Ha."
It's terrible.
The slashed wounds are healing, but lots of places are turning dark red.
...Archer said something about Saber's sheath, but what's that power putting priority on?
It heals the torn flesh at once, but it seems to be putting off the broken bones until later.

"...?"
Then.
I hear loud footsteps from the west side, the hallway that Lancer disappeared into.

Someone's coming.
She appears in the terrace and jumps down without hesitation.
"Ouuuu"
And she moans in pain at her landing.

"Shirou, are you all righ
 Wait, Archer! What's with that wound...!?"
She follows her sudden arrival with a torrent of questions.

It seems Lancer saved Tohsaka as he promised.
ButTohsaka's energy takes the power out of me.
Does she want to check on my safety, or is she angry about Archer's wound?

"......Man, I am really soft-hearted.
 If she'd been more cruel, I wouldn't have returned to my old self."

He talks sarcastically, but his voice only contains warmth.
After looking at Tohsaka once, the knight in red steps back as if to exit the stage.

"Well, the match is settled. A hero called Emiya cannot stay here now that he has approved of you.
 The loser should leave right away."


Without saying goodbye to Tohsaka, huh?
...His wound is deep and he has no Master.
He will disappear here, and he will return to the original place as a heroic spirit

"Huh?"
It happens in an instant.
It is a fatal attack that takes the opening in me, as I have relaxed after seeing Tohsaka.
Several swords are called forth.
The rain of swords comes down to pierce Emiya Shirou's body and

I fall.
I'm pushed back and I fall on my butt.


"Guh......!"
I'm pushed back about a meter.
In front of me...

...My broken limbs cannot support my body, and I do not have the power to get back up.
And so...
I can only look up at my self that got skewered in front of me.

"Who is it!?"
Saber's scream cuts open the silence.
She is looking at the second flooron top of the crumbled stairs.

"I have enjoyed it. Indeed, it was a pitiful battle, one befitting a pair of fakes."

"Archer......!?"
"Ten years, huh, Saber? I was going to go see you earlier, but my plans have changed. Unexpected things kept on happening, and things are going against my will."

Servant Gilgamesh. The one to defeat Berserker, and the one who killed Ilyasviel.
...He turns aside Saber's glare and looks down at me and the skewered Archer.

"Well, do you understand now? That is the strength of the real thing.
 No matter how well you imitate its shape and power, it is still only an imitation. It does not even approach the radiance of the real ones."

He raises his hand.
It's as if he is ordering his soldiers.

"I cannot even stand to look at a counterfeit that a faker has created.
 You piece of trash. You have nothing real within you.
 An imitation made by copying people should be turned into junk."
He shoots numerous Noble Phantasms.

The unavoidable rain pours down.
There are about thirty of them.
I couldn't dodge or block them even if I was in perfect condition.

Clouds of dust spring up.
The shower of swords tears apart the already-ruined hall.

But even in the midst of the chaos, I see it.
The red cloak flies.
Still skewered, he runs to me and pushes me once again.


I'm pushed away from the red figure.
His eyes are telling me...
..."You defeat him".
That as long as I defeated Archer and as long as I want to be a superhero, I must defeat him.

The clouds of dust fill my vision.
The red cloak sinks inside the rubble.
But I see it before he disappears.

His eyes are filled with confidence.
That Servant is no match for us, Emiya Shirou.
Neither Saber nor Tohsaka will be the one to defeat him.
My own self is telling me that Emiya Shirou is the natural enemy of that Servant

My vision clears up.
Dust is in the air, and the rubble is piled up high.
There is nothing else.
The knight in red disappeared underneath the rubble.

"Oh, I'm surprised, Archer. You had enough to spare to save someone else in that situation?"
His sarcastic words contain some scorn.
The man smiles in satisfaction as he looks down at the hall filled with Archer's blood.


Silence falls.
Gilgamesh is the most powerful being here.
Anyone that moves will follow Archer's fate.
Even Saber is silent, wondering how best to attack the enemy.
But.

"Whose permission did you get to attack my Archer!?"
With Archer's death, Tohsaka has lost her composure.

Light runs across space.
Pure destructive force, magical energy released from the jewel without any processing.

He does not even dodge it.
He isn't even scratched.
"I was going to kill that dying kid first.
 But it seems the order has changed, woman."
He orders the swords behind him to carry out Tohsaka's execution.

The sword is released at high velocity.
Saber runs with surpassing speed and protects her Master.

"S-Saber...!?"
"Please step back, Rin...! He is dangerous! He will kill you if you attack him recklessly...!

"Oh, so you are her Master now?
 Fine. Then I shall overlook your rudeness. I will lose one of my pleasures if Saber disappears."

Saber glares at the enemy while readying her invisible sword.

"Why are you here, Archer? You were summoned in the previous Holy Grail War.
 So why are you here again in this war?"
"That is wrong. I merely stayed in this world after the previous war."

"Wharidiculous. Servants should lose connection with this world once the Holy Grail disappears...! There is no way you can stay in this world for ten years...!"

"That is not true. The connection with this world is not the Holy Grail, but the Master. The Holy Grail merely opened up the passage. I can stay in this world as long as a magus provides me with magical energy."

"But then, there aren't that many Masters that can maintain a Servant without help from the Holy Grail. In that regard, my Master did not have enough magical energy."

"......? Then it should not be possible for you to stay in this world. If your Master cannot support a familiar like you, you should be dried up along with your Master."

"That depends on how one does it. Magi make up lack of a Magic Circuit with knowledge.
 In that regard, my Master was exceptional."

...'Was'?
Then his Master is gone now...?
No, his Master is Shinji.
The fact that he, the man who would not obey anyone, obeyed Shinji is the proof of that.

"...Then your Master did the same thing as Rider's Master...?"

"Yes. It is only natural to take away from others if you cannot supply it yourself.
 But to be honest, I did not need to do such a thing. I am the only Servant that the Holy Grail poured on. I have already completed the incarnation ten years ago."


Saber stares at the man in astonishment.
Saber hangs her head at the words "ten years ago".

"Yes, all thanks to you, Saber.
 I know what that thing is. I was covered in its intestines and I saw what 'existed' in it."

"Then you..."
"Yes. I understood the true identity of the Holy Grail.
 I decided at that time. I will be the only one who will handle it."

Saber.
No, looking down at all of us, he declares something that is unbefitting for a Servant.

"Youwill use the Holy Grail?"
"That's right. There is no need for me to share it with a parasite like my Master. I will use the Holy Grail for my objective.
 The biggest obstacle, the summoner, was eliminated.
 All that's left are pathetic magi that would be completely unsuited to being the vessel.
 Such failures are suited for my wish.
 But thenyour flesh might make a perfect Holy Grail."

The man looks at Tohsaka.
"Oh......"
Tohsaka must feel the danger, as she grows pale and steps back.

...His red eyes are ominous.
One would feel uncomfortable under the weight of that gaze.
His eyes are so aberrant that even Tohsaka is frightened of them.

"Ridiculous. The Holy Grail is what the Master obtains.
 We Servants cooperate with our Masters because we cannot obtain it ourselves...!"

"That is strange.
 The Servants are the only ones who can touch the Holy Grail, but Masters are the only ones who can obtain it?"

"Uhbut..."

"...Heh. It's all ridiculous nonsense.
 The fight for the Holy Grail by Seven Masters? A ritual where the last Master obtains the Holy Grail?
 That is only an excuse made for outsiders.
 The summoning of the Holy Grail is already completed. They always call for the seven Servants after the Holy Grail is prepared.
 Do you understand, king of knights? They do not want the Holy Grail, but what goes in it."

"Masters are just circuits to summon us. Magi made the Holy Grail, but they could not prepare its contents."

"I told you earlier, right? They are ones that take away from others if they cannot supply it themselves.
 The purest magical energy to fill the Holy Grail.
 The 'greatest souls of humanity', the guardians, are what they sought. The seven Servants are sacrifices they prepared."

"What?"
Saber looks up at the man in astonishment.
Her eyes are desperately trying to deny his words.
...That it isn't possible.
She is trying to deny it saying that what she wished for, the Holy Grail, cannot be such a thing.

"You should not be surprised. The Holy Grail is a filtration device that turns the soul into pure magical energy.
 Yes, it should let you grant any wish. It contains more magical energy than a magus could ever use within his lifetime.
 That is why it is better with more sacrifices. It should be omnipotent with six Servants as sacrifices.
 Five Servants have filled the Holy Grail. Only one more is needed for the omnipotent grail they sought."

"Then... Then only the Masters can handle the Holy Grail. If it is a repository of pure magical energy, only magi can use it.
 ...Yes. If the Master is an excellent magus, it"

"It will grant him any wish?
 You idiot. Such miracles are not given to mere humans. Humans only destroy themselves, no matter how much power they are given.
 Butdo not worry, Saber.
 This Holy Grail is real. If you insert seven Servants in it, it will reach the origin."

"......Origin......? Hold on. Then could the Holy Grail be...?"

"I do not know who it was, but the one who made this rule is a genius.
 But it does not concern me. I have no interest in such a thing. All I am interested in is the Holy Grail's ability to serve as the 'gate'."

"Whathe Holy Grail is a gate?"
"......Heh.
 It happened ten years ago. You opposed me right when I was about to obtain the Holy Grail.
 The Holy Grail was cut by the holy sword and what poured out burned the town.
 As I was right underneath the Holy Grail, I was showered with it."

"I understood the true identity of the Holy Grail at that time.
 It is worthless. It is worthless, but it does have its uses.
 Not many weapons are as specialized in murder as that. The Holy Grail is fine as is. There is no need to turn it into an omnipotent vessel."

"Weaponare you saying that a weapon is created out of Servants?"

"We are weapons to begin with. That thing has only perfected that. The Holy Grail is a gate to hell. 5.6 billion curses will flow out from it once it is opened.
 Kotomine did not tell you about it?
 The Holy Grail is named 'Angra Manyu', or 'all evils of the world'.
 It is mud that will consume every human being, like the name states."

......Angra Manyu?
I think that's the name of the devil in Zoroastrianism.
The leader of evil that opposes God for many thousands of years.
It is an embodiment of the evil in all human, and it is depicted as a reflected image of all humanity's good will.
But why is the Holy Grail named after the ancient Persian devil?

"Then your intention is to..."

"Yes, to sweep the humans away. I have no intention of admiring humanity like Kotomine. I only admire beautiful things.
 This world is enjoyable, but it is incorrigible at the same time.
 It is an insult to the king for so many wretches to be enjoying life.
 I do not want to rule over such a world."

"AAre you stupid!? What insult to the king...!? It's meaningless to be the king if all humans are eliminated!"

"I do not care if they die out. There is no point to their lives if they end them through their own crimes.
 I do not want lowlifes. The only ones worth ruling over are those that can survive even the flames of hell.
 In that respect, they were an utter failure ten years ago. If such a pitiful blaze will wipe them out, humans truly have become weak."

He grins.
For the first time...
He looks at me, who he said is a failure.

"I do not know what this 'all evils of the world' is.
 But it is convenient. It is a reaper that strikes down all humans equally.
 An endless darkness that is born from humans and kills them.
 It is an appropriate hound to entrust with the work I should be doing."

Gilgamesh raises his hand.
Behind him are Noble Phantasms waiting for the king's order.

"Then let us continue the battle from ten years ago. A boring lowlife got involved last time, but there will be no such interruptions this time.
 But thenit seems a worse faker is here...!"

The swords are all pointed at me.
"......!"
I will my broken legs to stand, but they do not move.

...Damn, I can't even manage to block one of those.
So whywhy did Archer leave behind that message...!?

"Hm?"
The swords disappear.
The golden Servant suddenly lowers his arm.
After looking up at the ceiling in discomfort, he brushes away the dust on his shoulder.

"The ashes will dirty me. You escaped death this time, child."
"Huh......?"

...The castle is burning.
I don't know who set the fire, but it must be huge.
The third floor is burning down and the second floor has caught as well.

...No, that's not the surprising thing.
He really stopped the battle just because he was going to get dirty from the ashes.

"Are you running away, Archer?"
"I am only changing the location. I have the Holy Grail.
 It is my policy to finish matters quickly. I shall quickly construct the Holy Grail and open up the gate to hell."

His golden hair flutters.
Gilgamesh walks to the terrace that isn't yet burning.

"You should hurry up if you want to recover it.
 The Holy Grail this time is a hurriedly-constructed defect. All the contents will spill out if you do not hurry...!"

His stifled laughter echoes through the room.
And he leaves the burning castle like that.
Sparks are dancing through the room, and the ceiling is tinted red.

...The gorgeous castle shows no traces of what it used to be.
The castle without a master crumbles without trace, as if to follow the girl in white.
"Haa, haa, haa, ha!"
Matou Shinji is running through the forest with beast-like breath.
He is actually running along a selected route, but his mentality is that of a wanderer.
He is running away without aim, so the word "wandering" is more befitting.

"DamnI was so close, and everyone's getting in my way...!"
He pushes the branches aside with one hand and runs while scattering wet dirt.
Leaving a trail of blood behind him, Matou Shinji heads to the edge of the forest.
He has not treated the wound he received from Lancer.
He does not feel his right arm anymore.
The wound is inflamed, and his arm will not move, as though dead.

"Hah... haa, ha, ah......!"
He must not be able to run with only one arm, as he slips and leans against a tree.
His dangling right arm is like a piece of trash.
As soon as he realizes that a part of his body is a useless piece of trash, Matou Shinji starts laughing.
"Hah... haha, ahahahaha."
The laughter comes out like a racking cough.

It hurts.
It must be because of the wound that his body is burning hot.
In a daze, he imagines one of his arms rotting away. After that, he imagines everyone around him rotting away.
Not just one of their arms.
He has one arm. All the other idiots should lose both of their arms.

"Ku"
He can't stop laughing.
With that decision made, the pain becomes bearable.
He has a legitimate purpose now.
The first thing he would do is collect every possible arm.
There will be no exceptions.

"...Ha, that's great. I know whose arms I'll get first."
The girl that did not become his.
Since she is his favorite, he cannot allow her to be superior to him.
"Yeah, just you wait, Tohsaka. I'll make you inferior."
Laughing, Matou Shinji raises his head.

"Huh?"
When did he appear? His Servant is standing right in front of him.

"You"
He looks at his Servant in surprise.
The golden Servant looks down at Matou Shinji as if looking at livestock.
"You are wounded. That must hurt."
And he says something that he does not mean.

"!"
Matou Shinji's face contorts.
Without realizing the true intention of his Servant, he glares at the man before him.

"'That must hurt'!? Whose fault do you think it is!? I got hit by Lancer because you're stupid!
 Don't talk shit when you can't even be my guard dog...!"
With his head on fire, Matou Shinji insults his Servant.
"Hm."
The golden Servant nods, saying "this will do".

"So Lancer inflicted that wound of yours, huh? Then it must have been him that released that Master."
"Yeah, Tohsaka ran away because you were such a slowass...! It makes me want to puke, thinking about how I lost her to somebody who was almost dead!"
"I see. That is too bad."

"...! Why are you so calm!? We can't obtain the Holy Grail without Tohsaka, right!? Damn, everything's ruined because of you! Do you understand!? What are we going to"
"Do not worry. Everything is as planned. The Holy Grail can still be created."
The Servant's voice contains no emotion.
Matou Shinji does not realize that the red eyes aren't looking at him.

"How!? Kotomine said that even if we have the Holy Grail, we can't make it if there's no vessel! That kid's heart is not enough. That won't turn into a Holy Grail unless we connect it to a Magic Circuit, right...!?"
Matou Shinji walks up to his Servant and scolds him for his stupidity.
The golden Servant nods and...

"There is no problem.
 There is another Master here that can be a vessel."
...He thrusts his arm.

A piercing sound.
Matou Shinji never finds out what the sound is.

"Huh?"
But he feels something funny in his stomach.
Looking down, he sees his Servant's arm there.
The fist is inside his body.
There is neither pain nor blood.
The Servant's arm is in his body, like the absurd spiritual operation he saw before.

"You want the Holy Grail, right? Then I shall give it to you. If you want it so much, do not let go of it."
"AhAh, ah?"
His blood vessels expand.
After feeling the sensation of billions of worms, squirming through his body and trying to get out...
"GiGi, gi?"
He becomes something that is not Matou Shinji.

"Gyagi, bia, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....................!!!!!"

It convulses.
The swollen object is literally a lump of meat.
There is no shape to it.
It is composed of exposed meat and blood vessels, quickly forming meat, and quickly decaying meat.

"IIt hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it's growing, it's growing, help, help, help, stop"
Unable to bear the pain of the repeating growth and decay and the sensation of "something" wriggling inside of him, he loses his sanity.
After watching it, the Servant lets him go as if nothing has happened.

"This is ugly. A powerful magus should not change form, but I guess it cannot be helped."
A chain comes down.
Descending from the sky, heaven's chains bind the writhing mass of flesh.

The balance of expansion and decay is about the same right now, but the Holy Grail should figure out its master soon enough.
Expansion should overwhelm the decay by then.
His Holy Grail should be completed in no time.

"Ugly things are tastier.
 Most of allyou shall spit out suitable mud, Shinji."
The Servant laughs.
And beside him...
The piece of meat repeats "help me" in a voice that is no longer human.
The lights are turned off.
The phosphorescent lamp is illuminating the room.


My heart is beating fast.
My hesitation was blown away with the kiss, but I grow more tense by the minute.
I get dizzy thinking about what I'm going to be doing.
I try to reason with my raging instincts, but my resistance is fading by the second.

"! "
...That's right. I'm not nervous because this is my first time.
I'm going to have sex with Tohsaka.
I finally realize that it's an outrageous thing.

"......"
Tohsaka is waiting for me.

"Well, Tohsaka..."
I walk towards her using my unresponsive legs, and try to touch her arm.

"...Hold on. Let's do it again before that. You do it to me this time."

I feel an impact, as if a nail is hammered into me.
...She must be as tense as me, if not more.
Tohsaka is bashful, and my tension is all blown away by her awkwardness.

"Okay. Let's do it again."
I hold Tohsaka's hand.
Her fingers are tense, her neck even more so.

"......"
Where did her previous confidence go?
Tohsaka curls up and waits for me like a small child.

"......Hey. Are you nervous, Tohsaka?"
"......! I-I'm not...! We already kissed once, so why do I have to be nervous...!?"

"I see. That's good. But I thought I'd ask, you know?"
"! J-Just carry on...!
 ......I-I won't let you to go any further unless you kiss me"

"!"
Crap, that just turned on my switch.
Tohsaka looks cute, trying not to let me see her trembling.

She closes her eyes and waits for my kiss.
Her lips are shaking and her body looks so weak right now.

"I'm doing it, Tohsaka."
I grab her arm and pull her towards me.
I try to copy what she did and kiss her.
I feel her lips for only an instant.
Tohsaka must have panicked as she suddenly pulls her head back.

"Oh"
Tohsaka looks up at me in blank amazement.
It's natural that she drew back.
I just pressed my lips onto hers.

"...I-I'm sorry. I didn't know how strong I should've done it."
"N-Nothat wasn't your fault."
She hangs her head in embarrassment and takes a deep breath.
"......I'm sorry. Um... you can continue, just as you were doing it."
Tohsaka blushes and closes her eyes.


My body heats up.
I don't even think about trying to be nice this time.
I press my lips onto hers as if to bite her.

"Ah... Hm..."
I feel a soft sensation.
We touch for only a second.
Our lips press against each other and melt into one.

"Ah... Ha... HmHm..."
", "
I feel our lips dissolving into each other.
I taste Tohsaka.
I can feel the warm softness of her wet lips, and the sensation of her breath escaping.

"Hmm... hm, ...Ah, mm....."
Everything is torture.
She's so close to me.
The one I love is as close to me as possible.
Touching her lips is driving me crazy, but this is still not enough.

I want to embrace her harder.
I want to melt into her.
My brain wants to reach ecstasy just from kissing her.
I feel an uplift like ejaculation.
But I can't orgasm from just a kiss, and it's driving me mad.

"Ha... hm, fuah, huh...?"
", Ha."
My penis is already erect.
...I push my erect self onto Tohsaka.

"Ah, hm... What... is this... Shirou? Something's... hitting me"
Tohsaka's breathing goes wild.
As it does, a red flush begins to spread up her neck.

"Hahm, hmm, hm......"
...We don't try to do anything else but press our lips together.
Our lips remain closed, and we do not even try to put our tongues out.

I'm scared we won't be able to turn back if we do so.
That's why we're only kissing with our lips.
It's an incomplete contact, neither deep nor soft.

"Ah... Hm, ah, it's getting harder..."
"...Hm, haTohsaka..."
"Hm... Ah......!"
I reach out with my arms as if to reach out for air.

"Haa... ahhuh? Wait, Shirou...!?"
I keep Tohsaka still using my right hand.
I use my left hand to grab her breast.

"Hm...! N-No...! Don't grab me there, ou......!"
I cover up her mouth.
I'm not going to listen to her complaints.
I can feel her breathing, even as I squeeze her breast in my hand.

"Ow, it hurts...! Don't do it yet...! We have to stay at a kiss right now...! Hm, hm...!"
"Why not...? Your breasts feel good"
I frantically dig my fingers into her flesh.

"Ahhm...... My breasts feel good...?"
"...Yeah... Touching them makes you seem even more like a woman? You're cute when you're embarrassed and panting."

"You idiotwhat are you saying... Hm, fuh...! Ha, haa... hm............ You idiot."
She sighs.
Tohsaka's breast fits in my hand.
It barely escapes my hands when I squeeze them.
I think its shape and softness are in perfect balance.

"...Tohsaka. Does it still hurt?"

"......Huh......? Ah, hm... it hurts, butI'm getting... used to it. So... I'll bear it for a bit longer..."

She pants.
...Her body is heating up.
I can see her breasts heaving, even under her shirt.
She's still resisting me, but she's trying her best to catch her breath so that she can accept it.

"Hm."
"......Huh, Shirou...?"
I pull back, bringing our lips apart.
I can't stand it any longer, and there's no need to restrain myself.
We're both ready for this.
I might lose all control if it continues like this for much longer.

"...Um. Can we get started, Tohsaka?"
Even though we're ready, it's still embarrassing to say it.
It must be the same for Tohsaka.
"............Yeah. I was thinking the same thing."
She replies with a red face.

"...Then I'm taking off my clothes. Can you look away...?"
"OhI see."
I quickly turn my back to her.
...That's right.
Having sex means getting naked.
I forgot that simple, yet scary, fact until now.

"Ugh........."
Sweat forms on my forehead.
I get dizzy just imagining Tohsaka's naked body.
I bet my heart will beat twice as fast if I actually see it.

".........Hm."
No, it's good if that's the only thing that happens to me.
...I hear her taking her clothes off.
I'm worried if my sanity will still be there once I look behind me.

"...Hey. Why are you spaced out, Shirou?"
"Huh?"
"You're supposed to be getting naked too...! Y-You're a failure as a man if you're only letting the girl take off her clothes...!"
"Oh. Y-You're right. Sorry, I don't know what I was thinking...!"
I quickly strip down.

So.
"...Fine. You can turn this way now, Shirou."
I prepare myself and turn around.
I honestly think I'll get a nosebleed if I don't prepare myself.

"........."
I narrow my eyes and try not to look at Tohsaka.
Then.

"HEY, WHAT IS THAT!!!!?"

"Huh?"
My embarrassment and hope are blown away by her scream.

"T-Tohsaka...?"
"Whoa, hold on! Don't come over here....!
 What is that!? No way, no way, no way......!?"
Tohsaka panics.
...But Tohsaka still keeps her eyes on meno, on my erect penis.

"......Tohsaka. I don't know what you're surprised about, but that really hurts, you know."
Um, it hurts my pride as a man.

"Uhum."
That must have calmed her down.
Her face still burning, Tohsaka stares at my member.

"......Tohsaka. Um, that's difficult for me too. I'll have trouble restraining myself if you keep staring at it like that."
"Oh... I'm sorry. But, um, I was surprised."
She reaches out as she says so.

"H-H-Hold on! W-What are you going to do...!?"
"Oh, it looked so hard, so I thought about poking it..."
Tohsaka twirls her finger, her face turning even more red.

"!"
Y-You've got to be kidding...!
I might explode if Tohsaka pokes it with her finger...!

"AAre you stupid!?
 Don't do such embarrassing things...! Don't go near dangerous things!"
I don't know what I'm saying, but I try to keep Tohsaka away.

"...You're acting strange, Tohsaka. Does mine look weird?"
I object.

"Eh... No, that's not it... Um, it's different from what I heard. Um, I thought it was going to be smaller..."
She shows me the length she'd imagined with her fingers.
The distance between them is only about half as long as my erect penis.


It seems Tohsaka is thinking of when it is limp.

"...Hey. Is this really coming inside of me...?"
She blushes and asks me timidly.
But...
"I-I don't know! This is my first time, so there's no way I would know!"
I yell, hoping to make her back down.


Tohsaka looks at me in surprise.
"...I see. Yeah, so it's your first time too, huh?"
Then, she lets out a sigh of relief.

"........."
...Hold on.
By "you too", she means

"...Tohsaka, is this your first time?"

She replies with a glare.
It looks like she's saying "is that bad?"

"Ugh"
If this is her first time, um, she's a virgin, so it has to be painful for her.
Not only that, but it could be hard for her to get any pleasure out of sex

"Tohsaka, you..."
"...Humph. Forget about it. I'm the one who brought this up, so I'm prepared for it.
 ...I'm used to pain. Don't worry about me and you just concentrate on your own orgasm."
"...Um, you mean... ejaculate, right?"

"Yes. But don't let your guard down.
 We can't connect unless we both reach orgasm at the same time so that our protections come down.
 I'll take care of the contract and the connection of our Magic Circuits, so all you have to do is have sex with me."


That's right.
This is a ritual to get her to share her magical energy.
I can't just be driven by my desires.
All the more so if Tohsaka is a virgin.
We have to orgasm together, so I better make sure I pleasure Tohsaka as much as possible.

"We're only doing this to connect with each other, so don't do anything else, okay? ...I don't think I need to tell you, but I'll get angry if you do weird things."
"...? What do you mean by weird things?"

"Eh...? U-Um, like ejaculating inside of me or expecting me to do it with my mouth."
She hangs her head in embarrassment.

My desire surges up again at her gesture.
Her skin stimulates my desires.

"I know. But can I ask you something before we start?"
"W-What? I'll get angry if you tell me to do anything weird!"
Tohsaka glares at me, doing her best to look angry.
Seeing her cute embarrassment blows away my own embarrassment.

"Well, it's a simple question. Why aren't you taking off your top?"
"Huh...?"
Tohsaka sits there, dumbfounded.
The question must have caught her off-guard, as she looks at me as if she's seen a ghost.

And I wait for a few seconds before she replies.
"I-I don't have any particular reason! T-This is fine, right!? I-I-I only need to take my bottom off to do it, so I don't have to get naked."
"Why? I'm naked."

"......! That's fine because you're a guy! Girls have their reasons, so it's best if I'm covered up a bit...!"
Tohsaka pulls back as if running away.
That shirt must be Tohsaka's last defense.

I understand how she feels. It might be fine to let her keep her shirt on if it helps her keep calm.
But that's an excessive request.
I don't think any man would be able to consent to that.

"That's a problem. I might dirty your shirt, and I won't be able to concentrate if I have to worry about that. And..."
"Ugh. T-That's your problem. E-Even if you can't concentrate, I can concentrate, so"
"And I want to see your body. I won't do it unless you get naked."

"Y"
Tohsaka shuts her mouth upon hearing my selfish request.

"Tohsaka."
"F-Fine, you blockhead! I'll do as you wish, so turn around and close your eyes!"
"Oh, o-okay."
I'm taken aback at her pressure and close my eyes.
I don't hear the sound of her clothes.
I just feel the air moving behind me.

"......All right. You can turn around now, Shirou."
I nod silently at her tense voice.

A guest room without any moonlight...
Tohsaka's body is illuminated by the warm lamp, and it is so beautiful that it shatters my composure.

"............"
Tohsaka silently tries to avoid my gaze.
Her skin looks soft.
Her limbs look a bit girlish, as if they are not fully matured.
Her breasts, covered by her hands, are of perfect size. I bet they would shake like gelatin if I poked them with my finger.


I think praising her is unnecessary, so I continue to stare at her.
...Then.
I notice one part of her that hasn't changed.

"......Um. Aren't you going to take your stockings off, Tohsaka?"
"Do you have a problem with that? This is as far as I'm going to go. ...I won't let you see everything on our first time."
She sulks and looks away.

I don't think her legs will matter when she's taken off so much clothing, but I can't complain if she puts it like that.
...And she's already too seductive. I'll just accept this compromise right now.

"......All right. We're starting, Tohsaka."
I grab her arm without waiting for a reply.
...I push her onto the bed.
Her red-tinted body sinks into her long, black hair.

"Oh... Shirou. Um, if you can..."
"I know. I'll go slow, so you can just lie there."
"...Okay. Please go on."
Her voice trails off uneasily.
I slowly place my fingers on her breast.

"Ah... hm..."
I touch her well-shaped breasts.
Her plump breasts are hot, just like the rest of her body.

I wrap my hand around Tohsaka's female symbol.
"...Wow."
I let out a voice of surprise.
My mind goes crazy at its soft firmness.
The softness of her breasts stimulates my manhood.

"...No, that... hm, hurts a bit."
"Huh?"
I didn't squeeze them too hard, but it must have been painful for Tohsaka.
But I'm not calm enough to stop.
I want to feel her softness.
I want to continue feeling her breasts.

"Then... I'm doing this."
"Huh...? Ah, uh...!?"
I streak my tongue across her breast while keeping it in my hands.

"Haa... hm, that... tickles, but, that's, fine, hm...!"
I'm only pushing down on her breasts with my hands.
But they stick to my fingers, as if sucking on them.

"......Ah... Hm..."
"Hm... Do you like it, Tohsaka...?"
"Eh... oh, n-no, that's... not it..."
...Her breathing quickens.
While licking the breast, my tongue naturally reaches the very tip.

"Ah... mm..."
I lick her pink nipple as if tasting it.
I poke it and roll it with my tongue.

"...Ahh, hm"

Tohsaka is breathing faster and faster.
...Her breasts are getting hotter.
Her nipples are getting harder.

"Ha...... Haa... Mm, ah..."

But it seems Tohsaka isn't ready yet.
...She's breathing impatiently.
Tohsaka isn't that sensitive yet.
...It might be impolite to say this, but Tohsaka seems like the type that's hard to please.

"Hahm, Shirou, your tongue is hot... and wet... Ah, ya"

But I can't stop myself.
I'm licking her breasts and I'm already wanting to bite her nipples.
My brain is stimulated every time my legs rub against Tohsaka's thighs.
The soft sensation runs up my spine and into my brain.

"Ah, haa, hahm......!"
...Plus, Tohsaka is panting and opening up her body in front of me.


I want to taste her even more.
I want to make Tohsaka mine by force and

"Ah, hm...... Hya...!? N-No, where are you going, Shirou...!?"
I slide my tongue across her body.
I move my face below her chest.
I slide from between her breasts and down.

".........!!! No, ah, hm...!"
Her compliant body suddenly shakes.
"N-No...! Stay away from my belly button...!"
Tohsaka tries to hide her belly button.

"Hm... You're weak here, Tohsaka?"
"Ohhya, hyaa, uhhh......!!"
I block her hand with my forehead and lick her pretty belly button.

"Ah, nono, don't... Ah, hm, ah, no"

There's no power in her hands.
I can do whatever I want. My tongue goes past her pubes and reaches a small lump.

"Ah, hm......!!!!"
Tohsaka's voice gets higher.
I guess this is stimulating even for her.

"Hm, in that case"
"Ah... no...! Ha, ah... ahh...!"
I push away the skin of the bud with my tongue and expose her clit.
Her clit is swollen red and I bet it will shake if I poke it.

"Ha, ah, ahhhh...! N-No, don't, touch me there...! I-I'll really hate you if you do..."
Her tone of voice changed and she sounds like she's begging now.

"......?"
I raise my head to question her.
"Ah... haa... haa... ha.. Don't do it. If you touch me there, um... I'll get an orgasm before you will."
Tohsaka confesses.

"Hm... it's fine, so put it in... I'm... ready."


Is she really ready?
It doesn't look like she's wet enough.
It's starting to heat up, but it's not wet at all, and I don't think I can fit myself in there

"......!"
What should I do?
I should carry on caressing her in a situation like this, right? I hear it'll hurt unless I loosen it up with smaller things like my tongue and fingers...

"...Tohsaka. I know what you were telling me before, but I think I have to lick it at least, or something."
"Ehy-you mean lick mine...!?"
She resists, embarrassment clearly audible in her voice.
Her genitals are also excretory organs.
It seems like it's a big deal for her to have someone put his mouth down there.

"N-No...! You don't want to do such a thing, right...!?"
"I don't care. I won't mind doing it to you."
"! Uh... um. B-But don't do it. I'm fine... and, um... It's a problem for me if you do it."
"...? ...Problem?"

"I-It just is, okay...!? I'll go crazy if you do anything more to me, and it's embarrassing too, so just don't look at me too much, okay...!?"

"Oh. I see, so..."
She's just like me.
It's really embarrassing to get naked and have your body looked at.
...It was embarrassing for the guy, so it must be even more embarrassing for Tohsaka.
We're going to be having sex, but it seems Tohsaka doesn't want me to look at her vagina.

"...All right. I'm putting it in, okay?"
"............"
She replies by nodding.
I open up her legs and put my waist between them.
I grab my erect penis and push it onto her slit

"Hah, gu......!"
Tohsaka jumps.
I only pushed it in a bit, but Tohsaka reacts violently.

I hear a wet sound.
The erect penis goes between Tohsaka's red slit into her pink walls.

"Haah, ah, mn......!!"

"!"
Voice escapes my mouth at her hot, narrow hole.
Tohsaka isn't that wet as expected.
As it isn't wet, I'll be penetrating into her.

"Haah......! I-It's coming in...!"
It feels like I'm ripping it in rather than inserting it.
Her flesh is tearing as I push in further.

"......! I, ah... ku, hm...!"
I stop myself.
I think I'll d something to Tohsaka if I continue.
Tohsaka is gritting her teeth and bearing it, even though I still don't even have half of my tip inside of her.

"Ahhaa... haa... ah..."
Her body is tinted red from her own heat.
Drops of sweat form on her skin and her fingers are scratching the bed as if to bear my insertion.


If all this is caused just by inserting my tip into her, then there's worse to come.
But I've already started.
I feel Tohsaka already, even though she may only be in pain.

"Ah... haa... ah... fua."

Listening to her pained voice, I barely retain my sanity.
...I'll go slow.
I'll slowly put it in her so that it won't be painful.

"Relax, Tohsaka."
"Huh...? Ah, mn...! Hm...!"
I slowly push my hips.
It's really tight inside of Tohsaka.
I squeeze myself through her tight walls.
No, I'm wrenching open her pussy using my wet weapon.

"Haa, nn, no...! It's too big, no, it won't fit...!"
I don't feel like I'm being accepted.
Tohsaka feels only pain, and her body refuses the intruder coming into it.

"Hah!"
No, it isn't just that.
Her pussy contracts to push out the foreign substance.

"Ah, na, ah, ku......!"

"Haahh......!"
I push it open using force, taking the greatest care not to push in too fast.

...Damn.
It must be difficult for Tohsaka, but it's hard for me as well.
It mentally tires me to go easy on her, and her vagina is constantly stimulating me.
Her walls are contracting around me.
I feel her warmth through my penis.
The sensation of her fills up my brain.

"Guh"
I grunt at the sensation coming from my penis.
I want to go wild, but I restrain myself.
...It's hard for me.
I might ram it in her all at once if I let my guard down.

"Ah... It's... coming in"

I push it in slowly.
I manage to fit my head into Tohsaka.

I stop and check how Tohsaka's doing.

"Ahhaa, ah, ha......"

...She's breathing slower now.
I managed to get my tip in, so I think it'll be easier from now on.
But.

"Hm...... I-Is it not all in yet...?"

Tohsaka holds back her tears as she looks up at me uneasily.


...I'm just getting started here.
I only got my tip in.
This is just the start if I am to move my penis in and out.

"No, we're just getting started. I need to put it in more."

"...Oh, I see... So it's only the tip, huh?"
She murmurs.
...Tohsaka is at her limit.
Her pussy isn't wet.
Her walls are trying to keep me out.
It's not just her body.

...No matter how firm she may be... No, it may be because she acts firm all the time, but Tohsaka looks so vulnerable when she's naked.
She seems afraid of someone else coming into her body.

"...What do you want to do? Should we rest for a while...?"
"...No, I'm well rested now. ...I'm sorry for worrying you."
"Are you sure, Tohsaka?"

"...Yeah... I'm fineso go ahead, Shirou."

I'm filled with the urge to embrace her.
But I can't do anything unnecessary to her, as she's got her hands full with bearing the insertion.

"...Relax, okay? Tell me to stop if it hurts."
"...Yeah, I know."
I raise her hips just a bit.
Tohsaka squeezes my tip hard.
I spread open her walls to fight against it.

"Ha, nuu, mn...!!"

Tohsaka blushes at the different feeling of my rim going through her walls.

...I think it's a reaction she hasn't shown before.
She was only bearing the pain up to now.
She must have fully realized she's having sex now.
I see pain and embarrassment on her face.

"Ah... ha, ah, hmShirou, it's getting better, so... you can... be a bit more forceful"
Tohsaka tries her best to relax.
She's trying her best to take me in.

"Toh... saka"
...I might be able to now...
I might be able to go deeper into Tohsaka.

"Kya...!? Fua, hm, naa!!!!"

I push my hips in a bit harder.
My penis plunges into her.
Tohsaka shakes from the force.
I feel something elastic on my tip.

"Ah, haa, ou... Hm, haa, ou, ah... Haa, no... no...!"

"!"
Her walls squeeze hard on my penis.
Tohsaka's vagina tries to push me out as if screaming.

"Ah, guh."
I went too fast.
I hear her groan and quickly pull myself back.

"Oh... Why are you stopping...?"
"Why?"
"Hm... I'm fine... it hurts, but... it was only a bit. Please continue... Shirou..."

She appeals to me while trying to hide her pain.

She must have felt it pressing on the sign of her virginity.
Tohsaka knows what it means, but she's still bearing it.

"Mm, fua!!!!"
I push it in once more.
I move my penis awkwardly.
Tohsaka's body jumps when I move it just a bit.

"Ha, hm... Something's hitting me"
...She doesn't need to tell me.
I feel a wall that's blocking me that's different from the one squeezing me.

"...Emiya-kun...?"
Tohsaka looks up at me uneasily.
I nod back to her.
"I'm putting it in. I'm taking your virginity, Tohsaka."
Unwilling to put it off any longer, I push myself all the way into her in one motion.

"Ah, na, ahhhhh......!"
I push into her.
She tightens around me more than ever.

"Fu"
There's so much pressure that I feel like it's being cut off.
The sharp pain converts into pleasure and multiplies my joy at becoming one with Tohsaka.

"Ah, ou, ouch, no, I, I, ah, haa, ah! Haaha, na... it, fu, ahhhhhhh......!!!!!!"

Her pussy squeezes me.
But that doesn't last long as the pressure goes away slowly.

"AhAh... haa, ah...... hm......"
It's easy after that.
Tohsaka's body loses power after I take her virginity.
The last half of my penis goes into her as if the previous difficulty was a lie.

"Ah......Ha."
...Tohsaka catches her breath.
I won't be going deeper into her, so all that is left is to slowly soften her up.

"......Ha, ahis it all in...?"
I don't need to answer.
My penis is deep within her.
My erect penis fills up all of her vagina so that there's no extra space.
Even my tip is touching the entrance to her womb.

"Oh... moving it is..."
...Is it an after-effect of losing her virginity or is it resistance to the thing inside of her?
Unable even to lift up her arm, Tohsaka can only stare at the place where we are connected.
There's the surprise of accepting something she thought would never go into her, and the uneasiness of not knowing what to do now.
She already looks so cute that...

"Tohsaka, can I-"
"Ah... hm... I see... I'm filled with Shirou."
"!"
I can't ask her if I can move or not.

"Oh... it's... getting bigger"
She looks bewildered.
I ignore it and...
"I'm moving, Tohsaka. I can't hold it any longer."
"Eh... ah, hm...!?"

"Fu"
I pull my hips back.
I pull my boiling meat out of the hole that has been contracting to push me out.

"Ah, ahn...! No, nha, hafua, mm...!"
My stimulated cock is still full of desire.
There's no need to hurry.
I'll move slowly so that Tohsaka's body can get used to me.

"Haa... Ahhh... hm, ku...!"
Our flesh slides together.
I slowly move my waist back and forth to match Tohsaka's breathing.

"Ah, hm... No, don't move... Nha, ha... I still... have trouble breathing... Ah..."

Tohsaka's saying something under her ragged breath.
But my body doesn't follow my order.

"Haa...! No, Shirou, it still hurts...!"
I still hear pain in her voice.
Even though I took her virginity, the pain won't go away after I move it once or twice.

"Ah... Hm, haa, ah, mm...! It hurts... hm... it hurts, but..."
But still, I see some change.
I slowly keep moving in and out of her.

"......! Haa, ah... ha, haa, ah...!"

Her tense body gets hotter.
She still feels pain.
But at the same time
"Good... I'm really having sex."
Tohsaka's eyes well up with tears as if to show her relief.

"Ah, hm, ahh...! It's good, Shirou, keep moving"

She's accepting me.
She's enduring her pain and taking her time to accept a foreign intruder.

"HarderI'm a girl, too, na, fua, ah!!"

Tohsaka pants with her shoulders and tries to keep up with me.
Her tightness starts to send something other than pain up into my spine.

Our movements create a wet sound.
"Ahha."
Her tight pussy starts to get slippery. The scorching hole starts to turn into a heaving sea.

"Ah... Haa... ah, hahm... Ah, it feels good......!"
She must be getting used to it.
My pre-cum blends with Tohsaka's love juice.
Our movements create bubbles between us.


The female organ and the male organ rub against each other.
"Haa."
Pleasure runs up my spine into my brain.
There's no way I can bear this.
I want to embrace Tohsaka.
This gentle sex isn't enough for me.

"Eh, hm...? ...Shirou...? Wait... isn't it a bit strong...? ...Mm... Can you move... slower?"

I don't hear her.
And besides...
"...You should be able to take this. It's getting smoother than when we first started."
"Ha... but this is good enough for me"
"It's not good enough. I want to embrace you even more."
My reason has already been thrown to the wind.

"No, ah......!? Ha, Shirou, it hurts...!"
I push it into her.
I throw my previous gentleness out the door.
I move my hips violently so that our waists hit each other...!

"......!! Ya, ha, no, stop, naaa...!"
Her body arches back.
I can't contain my lust and it even turns Tohsaka's voice into urges.

"Ha, nha, haa, ah! Ou, it's rubbing me...! Ah, ha, ah, hm!?"
She twists her hips to get away.
But there's nowhere for her to go as I'm holding them, so all she can do is stay there and accept me.

"Stop, I'm telling you... to stop...!
 Fuaa, hm, ku...! I'm really gonna get mad...!"
"Haayou can resist me if you want... You're not doing it because it feels good, right?"
"...But... I-I can't put power into my limbs, ah, hm, ahh...!"

I'm shaking her body, and her long hair scatters across the bed.
Her well-shaped breasts shake like jelly and the pure sight of it drives me crazy.

"No, no, It'll tear apart... again...! Ahh, ou, it really hurts... nn, fua, haa, no, ha...!"

I keep moving in and out.
The movement is smooth.
Her love juice and the blood from losing her virginity are dampening her pussy.
The movement creates wet sounds...!
The friction encourages my sensitive penis.

"Haaah, ahh......!"
", , ......!"
I feel nauseous.
I grit my teeth and bear the pleasure that makes me want to scream.
It should be the same for Tohsaka.
Her soft-looking skin is covered with sweat.

"AhAh, ahit hurts... but it feels goodyou're mixing me up too much, so I'm going crazy!"

"Ah... haa, kuh...!"
It feels like we're entangled with each other.
No, it's not just a feeling.
We are connected.
I'm penetrating Tohsaka, and Tohsaka is accepting me.
This is the pure action to try to take each other in.

The movements make a wet sound...!
This act is intended to make us one.
I keep up my simple movement of moving back and forth.

"Ahno, it's coming deeper!"

The simple movement unifies our minds.

"Hait's coming in deep"

This raw pleasure burns away my sanity.
This simple, simple, simple action feels so good!

"Ha, ah, hah......!!!!"
I move faster.
I push in so hard that I might go into her womb.

"Ahh, nha, ha, ah! Ow, ow, ow, it hurts, Shirou...!!"
I'm not holding anything back now.
I want her so much that I want to break her body, her tears, and her voice

"Ah, faah, no, ah......! This, this is scary, no, nonononono...!"
Pain isn't the only reason she's screaming.
Tohsaka fears the pleasure coming from the violent thrusts.
As proof...

"...! Tohsaka, you're so tight...!"
She reacts to my desire.

"I-It's not my fault...! I-It's all your fault, Shirou, hn, haa, ah, ahhhh...!"
The sensations from my penis fill my mind with blinding light.

Tohsaka is getting tighter.
Her walls are contracting around me.
Her soft meat tightens around my tip, my shaft, and my whole penis.
The sensation is so overwhelming that it makes me want to explode my brains out as well.

"AghTohsaka...!"
"Ow, ow, it hurts, but it feels good!
 Ah, ahn, uha, haa, ah...! I-I'm melting, I'm going crazy...!"

Her thighs are slick with dripping juice.
Her tense body is now a ripe fruit.
I push in my penis.
Her walls close around me, simultaneously accepting and resisting.
I pull out and push it back in over and over.

"Ahh, nha, ah, haa...! I-I'm gonna break, you're filling me up...!"

I stimulate her and blow away her reason.
I push her mind up to a higher level.
There's no limit.
I just need to get our minds to white out and

"AhAh, nha, ahhhhhhhhh......!"
Tohsaka lets out a loud moan.
With her eyes closed in pleasure, she tightens around me to make me ejaculate.

My vision flickers.
I can't think.
I can only see the person in front of me, Tohsaka Rin.
Our minds are at their limits.
They stimulate one another and the pleasure increases with it.

"Ha, ah......!"
Our minds are melted together.
There's nothing to hold back now.

"NoI can't hold it anymore...! Shirou, I...!"
Just like Tohsaka, who is trying to bear her orgasm, I'm about to explode as well.
"Toh... saka...!"
And I push it in.
I push it into her so hard that my penis would strike her womb...!

"Shirou...! Shirou, nha, ahh, haah, you idiotah...!!!!"

"Guh......!?"
Tohsaka's body loses strength and falls onto the bed.
Lightning runs through me at that moment.
Tohsaka's walls convulse violently as she orgasms.

"Ah...!"
Her walls squeeze my shaft.
My penis is wrapped around by numerous walls.
She squeezes cum out of me as if to get me back for all I've done to her.

"! Ah"
I can't hold myself back anymore and release it.
I ejaculate onto her defenseless body.
...What a bad mistake.
I managed to pull my hips back at the last second so that I wouldn't ejaculate inside of her, but

"...T-Tohsaka."
I try to apologize, but I stop myself.

"......Ah...... Hm...... It's so hot..."

I guess it's meaningless to tell Tohsaka anything right now.
She is spaced out from the orgasm, and she is trying to catch her breath.

"Haa."
I'm tired as well.
I should be resting so that I can regain my energy.
I should be, but

"......Hm... It's so sticky... Ha, Shirou's is spilling away..."

"......!"
Tohsaka's figure is too tempting.
My cum is spilled on her heated body.
My semen drips down her soft skin every time she breathes.

"Ahugh."
...This is bad.
My lust might return if I keep watching something like this.

"...Is there anything to wipe with?"
I shake my head and look through the room.
I want to keep watching her, but this is no time to be doing that.
We're done now, so Tohsaka will scold me unless I switch my mind

"...I can't believe it.
 Don't you remember anything about being gentle, you beast!?"

Hey.
Tohsaka still scolds me.
And it's not in her usual arrogant way. She's yelling at me in a way that makes me realize I've done a bad thing.

"Um, Tohsaka."
"...You stupid Shirou. I told you it hurts. ...I'm never going to have sex with you again."
"Uh
um."

What can I say back to that?
I think I'll only piss her off more if I apologize, but I think it does no good to say nothing.

"Tohsaka, um..."
I can't look away from her tears and I try to find something to talk about.

"......Oh yeah. Did the contract go well? Um, it turned out like that in the end, but..."
"Of course! I'd be doing the same thing to you if we couldn't connect our circuits after that!"

"Oh."
She yells at me.
I don't know if I've succeeded, but Tohsaka is yelling at me as usual.

"I see. Then our Magic Circuits are connected, right?"
"...It's a one-way path from me to Shirou, but yeah.
 It will take a bit before the effect takes place, but you should be able to receive my magical energy supply as a reserve tank."

Tohsaka glares at me as she explains.
Tohsaka created our connection even when I was going wild over her.

"Then..."
"Yes. I can provide you with enough magical energy to activate your Reality Marble.
 The rest is up to you now."


I close my right hand in front of Tohsaka.
I don't really feel it yet.
But I believe our contract is there, since Tohsaka said so.

"Thanks, Tohsaka. And I'm sorry. I couldn't hold myself back and made you cry."

"......! Humph! I won't forgive you even if you apologize.
 You made me cry twice, so I'm going to get you back someday!"
Tohsaka glares at me.

...I don't know if she's angry or just sulking.
Tohsaka's voice is surprisingly kind.


So I'm forced out of Tohsaka's room.
She told me that girls have their business, so I should be considerate and go back to my room.

"...Don't be stupid. Guys have a lot of business as well."
I do, but I didn't say so in front of Tohsaka.
I bet she would have gotten me back right on the spot if I said so.

"......Besides..."
No matter what Tohsaka may need to do, it's true that we don't have much time.
The date has changed already.
I bet we should be heading out to the Ryudou Temple within an hour.

"Hmyeah, this is..."
I close my eyes and feel the magical energy pouring into me.

Tohsaka isn't consciously supplying me with magical energy yet, but it's already enough to fill me up.
If Emiya Shirou's magical energy capacity is 20 or 30, she always has 500 magical energy.
...I'm sure it would take years to fill up her whole capacity, but I bet her maximum capacity could reach a thousand.

"...I'm amazed. She really is amazing."
It makes me realize her greatness again.
Well, she's exhausted right now and most magi only keep about 80 percent of their magical energy, so Tohsaka has about 400 magical energy right now.

But that is still a huge amount.
I use about two magical energy to use one strengthening magic, and about five magical energy to use one projection magic.
Using that example, I can use my projection magic dozens of times now when I could only do it six times before.

"......Well, a cheap vehicle will overheat even if there is enough gasoline."
But this has greatly increased my power.
I might even be able to beat that king of heroes with this.
All that's left is

"There's one more hour. I should rest my body until then."
I'll rest and restore the energy I used by having sex.
...Everything is set.
I'll fully prepare myself since Tohsaka has opened up her body to me.
I turn off the lights in my house.
It's four in the morning.
With dawn still a few hours away, we leave the Emiya household.

Everything is arranged already.
There's nothing to talk about now. We just need to go to battle and fulfill our roles.

...There's no guarantee that we'll come back alive.
No, that has been the case all along, but there's less of a guarantee this time.
That's why I'm carefully turning off all the lights.

"...Huh?"
There's someone standing in the yard.
The golden-haired girl is just standing there, looking up at the night sky.

"Hey. What are you doing, Saber?"
"I was watching the sky and this house."
Her reply is gentle.
She is looking at the house with an expression different from the first time I met her.

"A lot has happened. I want to engrave the events in my mind so that I will remember them forever."

It is...
...The voice of one prepared not to return.

"I see. ......Yeah, please remember it if you can."
I make a clumsy wish from the porch.

"Yes. Then I have a favor to ask of you as well.
 I will protect you two. So please come back to this house together."
"Yeah. We'll come back here no matter what."

That's all I can manage to say.
We're going to go destroy the Holy Grail. At the same time, Servant Saber will be returning to her original place.

Even if I want her to stay here, and even if Saber is attached to this house...
As long as she is a Servant, she cannot go against the law.

"Hey, what are you doing!? We don't have time, so hurry up...!"
A voice urges us from the entrance.
Tohsaka must be waiting at the gate, ready to go.

"Shirou."
"Yeah, let's go settle this once and for all."
I turn off the last light and leave the house with Saber.

A quiet night.
The illusion of the girl staring up at the stars is still lingering in the yard.

The plan goes like this.
Saber will head into the Ryudou Temple from the front while Tohsaka and I sneak in from the back.

Saber will enter before us so that she can get Gilgamesh's attention.
We will use that opening to sneak in, quickly destroy the Holy Grail, and go help Saber.

...I'll keep Gilgamesh at bay by projecting his Noble Phantasms, allowing Saber to finish him off
That is the only plan we have.


It is a path that you can barely call a road.
Tohsaka must have researched it beforehand, as she goes up without hesitation.

At night, the mountain is dark and ominous.
It is natural for the sacred mountain to reject people.
The dark mountain is threatening, but it is an embodiment of the pure gods at the same time.
But

"...This isn't normal. It smells so bloody that I feel sick."
Tohsaka stares up at the summit, where the Ryudou Temple is.
"Smelling bloody" is just a phrase Tohsaka used.
There is no smell of blood coming from the mountain.
It just feels strange.
The air is damp, and it sticks to the skin like a membrane.

The place is suffused with a life force so strong that I can't tell if the breathing I hear is mine or the mountain's.
I feel like I'm climbing up a big, living organ rather than a mountain.

"...I know it's late to ask, but how do you feel, Shirou?"
Then.
Tohsaka suddenly asks me such a question.

"Huh...? I feel fine, but really not...
 To be honest, it's beyond my control."

I honestly tell her.
I can easily project dozens of weapons with this amount of magical energy.
But it's like having a jet engine inside of a worn-out plane, so the fuel might leak out and explode if I let my guard down.

"Wow, that's a luxurious worry. But it did succeed, huh? I was worried since it was the first time..."

My face burns up the instant I recall it.

"Hold on. Please don't talk about it right now."
"I-I know! I feel the same way.
 ...I'm talking about something else.
 I'm talking about the balance of the magical energy I'm giving to you and Saber. I'm sharing my magical energy between two people, so Saber is getting less energy now."

"OhI see. Then does that mean Saber can't fight with all her power?"

"Hey, don't take me so lightly.
 I won't do such a clumsy thing. The magical energy I'm giving you is small, so it's fine.
 But we can't push it. Saber can only use her holy sword once."

"She can only use her holy sword once?"
...Then we can't use the holy sword against Gilgamesh.
Saber's Noble Phantasm has to be saved to destroy the Holy Grail.

"Then Saber has to keep Gilgamesh busy without using her Noble Phantasm!?"

"Yeah, so we'll have to go help her as quickly as possible.
 I told her that she can use the holy sword if she can't stop Gilgamesh by herself.
 ...But that would be it for Saber. Only her holy sword can destroy the Holy Grail.
 So"


My breathing stops.
In short...
She will have to use her holy sword at the cost of her existence

"Tohsaka, that's..."
"...It can't be helped. It's what Saber said. She will destroy the Holy Grail even if I stop her."
Tohsaka murmurs as she looks away.


...Damn, how stupid of me.
It must be hard for Tohsaka as well.
Tohsaka doesn't want Saber to disappear either.
Then

"Let's hurry. We won't give Saber to Gilgamesh."
"Of course not. She's mine. I won't let him kill her."

We run.
We know what we have to do.
We have to stop the Holy Grail as fast as we can and go settle the match with Gilgamesh
The mountain is rumbling.
The sky is filled with dark clouds, and the trees are rustling as if shivering with fear.

She watches it all at the entrance to the mountain gate.
She understood that the Ryudou Temple was poisoned the instant she approached it.
The golden Servant isn't the only one waiting for her at the top of the stairs.
Something strange is waiting for her.


She takes a big breath.
She cannot afford to make a mistake.
If the mountain is a place of death, then she will draw all the risk to herself.
She wants the other two to make it out alive.

She cannot hold anything back.
She can only use her holy sword twice.
She understands that she will disappear the instant she activates the holy sword for the second time.

"I do not care. He is an enemy I cannot match unless I risk my life."
The king of heroes, Gilgamesh.
She cannot think of anything else but to use the holy sword against that man with a thousand Noble Phantasms.
'Go after thirty minutes, Saber.'
She recalls Rin's words.
It is only one more minute until the appointed time.
She breathes out and sets her condition.

Wind blows down from the mountaintop.
The instant the trees shiver against the evil wind, she starts up the stone steps.

She runs up in a flash.
Her attack must have been detected the instant she stepped onto the stairs.
The last Servant should appear at the temple.
She will get to him as quickly as possible so she can defeat him before Shirou and Rin arrive.

...She cannot disobey her Master's order.
She started off after waiting thirty minutes, just as Rin ordered.
Even if she arrives at the temple before Rin expects her to, she is not going against Rin's order.
It is just that she will protect her master's life, and go against Rin's expectation as a result.


If the thing leaking out from the mountain is pollution, Saber is a raging wind that blows the pollution away.
It should not take her a minute to get to the top.
She will be five minutes faster than what Rin is expecting.
She can end her fight against Gilgamesh in that time.

"Haa!"
She runs, enduring the mountain's chill.
The silver armor shoots up to the temple like a bullet.

And when she finally reaches the mountain gate...
"What?"
Her feet, which should not stop, come to an unexpected halt.
Sweat runs down her forehead.
She looks up at the mountain gate in astonishment.

"I have been waiting for you. I am glad you made it in time, Saber."
An elegant voice echoes through the night.
Moonlight glints off the longsword.
On the stairs leading up to the mountain gate...
Stands an enemy who should not exist.

"Assassin"
There is no elegance in Saber's voice.
An enemy that should not be there, an obstacle that should not exist.
She cannot be calm in the face of these surprises.

"What is wrong, Saber? Is it that much of a surprise that I am here?
 You should know that I am the guard here."
His pleased voice is calm and composed.
The swordsman is acting casually, even with the evil wind swirling about.

"...Impossible. Why are you here, Assassin...!? Caster summoned you. You cannot exist since Caster is gone...!"
"That should be the case for normal Servants. But I am a bit special. It is not a person, but this land that is binding me.
 Masters are the hosts which keep you in this world. It is this mountain in my case."

"Whathe land is the host...?"
"Right. Servants, ones without form, cannot maintain other Servants even if they are magi. A host from this age is needed to keep a Servant in this world.
 That fox summoned me and chose this land to be my host.
 Therefore, I am a Servant that can only appear here. I will not disappear as long as the mountain exists, even if Caster, my summoner, dies."

"But that is only borrowed time.
 The fox gave me about twenty days' worth of magical energy. You should be able to tell when my limit is."
Saying so, the swordsman raises his right hand.
Inside his elegant kimono...
His white arm is transparent like glass.

"Assassinyou..."
"I will not last until dawn, as you can see.
 The appointed time of twenty days is already over. It is just luck that kept me alive this long."


She looks up at the swordsman in astonishment.
Neither enmity nor murderous intent is emitted from his sword.
He just wishes for a fight.
He is demanding a meaningless battle.

"Then you have stayed just to fight against me, Assassin?"
"Do not let me say it, Saber. It will just turn into meaningless words if I say it."

He laughs.
She can understand how he feels.
But she does not have the time right now.
The other two will make it in time for the battle unless she hurries.
No, in the worst casethey will reach the temple to face Gilgamesh even before she does.

"Move aside, Assassin. The one that ordered you to protect this gate has died. There is no longer a reason to follow that command."
Saber asks while she takes a step forward.
But
"I refuse. I had no reason to fight from the start."
Assassin points his sword at Saber, saying that he will start the fight if she comes any closer.

"No, I do not have a reason to fight. From the very beginning, I have had nothing. I do not have pride as a heroic spirit, and I do not have a wish I want granted.
 Nofirst of all, it was a mistake that I got summoned. Because I am not Sasaki Kojirou."

"!?"
Saber's confusion reaches its limit.
Sasaki Kojirou.
It should be the true identity of this Servant.
But Assassin himself said that he is a fake.

"You should not be so surprised.
 Sasaki Kojirou was never more than a fictional swordsman without a true identity.
 It is said that he existed, but records on him are too vague.
 His 'past' was falsely forged as a convenient foe to a famed swordsman."

"I am sure a man named Sasaki Kojirou existed. I am also sure that there was a swordsman who used Monohoshizao.
 But they are not the same person.
 A swordsman with the name Sasaki Kojirou is a fictional character created to be his enemy's foil."

"You area fictional heroic spirit?"
"Yes, I am Sasaki Kojirou. It merely means that I am the best suited for this role.
 I do not have a name. I do not know how to read or write, and I was not fortunate enough to be given one."

"I am a phantom that was summoned just because I could execute Sasaki Kojirou's secret technique.
 As I am a false Servant, I cannot last long. Caster treated me as a disposable Servant because of that reason."

"See, there is no meaning in this, right?
 Even if I am to perform a great deed here, all the reward will go to 'Sasaki Kojirou'. I will get nothing. As I am nothing, everything is meaningless.
 I am not even clear about myself. I am only a disposable swordsman that acts out the role of Sasaki Kojirou."
His longsword wavers.
The fictional swordsman created by a fictional story blocks her way as if to fulfill his role.

"But.
 If there is a meaning in me, it is now.
 If there is a wish for 'me' who died nameless..."
He must have...
...He must have dreamed of a match with a superior swordsman who he could not have been allowed to witness as a nameless swordsman.

"Assassin."
...She readies her sword.
She cannot convince her enemy.
The only way she can answer the swordsman who is prepared for his death is to fight him.

"Then let us start.
 My life will end no matter what. There can be no better end than to die at your hand!"
His longsword moves.
Saber's sword repels the strike like moonlight.

"Kuh!"
His longsword wavers.
She cannot match Gilgamesh if she uses up her powers here.
But she cannot afford to hold back.
Noshe does not know if she can win, even if she uses all her powers.

His longsword gets more fierce with each blow.
A fictional swordsman.
A swordsman who can match a heroic spirit without a Noble Phantasm.
She must settle her match with him right here and now
"Let us."

And the swordsman readies his sword.
The only stance for the man who does not have a stance.
A fatal technique that cuts his enemy by simultaneously executing blows from different angles.
She has experienced the move before.
...The previous one only had an arc to surround his enemy and a vertical slash.
That is why she was able to avoid it and live up to this day.

But the real technique has three slashes.
A circular slash and a vertical slash. ...And probably a horizontal slash that cuts anyone that escapes sideways.
There is nowhere to run if the three attacks are executed all at once.
Once in range, the other two attacks will cut you even if one is blocked.
One cannot escape sideways, and the longsword will reach out even if one retreats.

Demonic technique, Tsubame Gaeshi.
A godly technique that even surpasses the Servants.
The ultimate attack, perfected by an anonymous swordsman using all his life.

The longsword trembles.
His body moves in with one step.
The distance to attack Saber.
Prison-like arcs are executed from a range that does not allow any defense!

Saber does not use her holy sword.
She cannot use her Noble Phantasm at this range.
No matter how fast Saber may be, Assassin's Tsubame Gaeshi is many times faster.
Her neck will be cut the instant she puts magical energy into her sword.
Therefore, her only weapon is pure technique.

The blade begins its arcs.
She feels despair from its precision and speed.
Such an attackhow much training was needed to get this far?


Fear is the only thing on her mind.
It cannot be blocked.
This technique is a technique of carnage that challenges God with mere human skill.
Only God would be able to block it.

"Haa"
She gulps.
There is a flash as small as a grain of sand.
She does not think about what it is, nor if it is correct.
She risks everything she has on her instinct.
"Ahh!"
She charges at her "victory" with all her might.

What did the fictional swordsman think of that?
"Kuh."
Silver armor passes through the gap beside his arm.
The opening between the swordsman's left arm and his waist.
Saber must have figured out that the small opening is the blind spot of the technique.

Even though the attack still chips off her armor, Saber curls up and flies through the opening.
An exquisite skill that is only possible with her precognitionher great instinct.
She was able to predict the true Tsubame Gaeshi since she experienced it once.

But that is not the surprising part.
It is her determination that kept her alive.
She trusted her insight and put all her power into the slight opening.
She shook off the fear that she would be slashed if she was even a moment late and charged into the small opening.
Therefore...
Her determination is the "strength" that defeated the demonic technique.

"Ah, gu......!"
But the match isn't over yet.
Even though Tsubame Gaeshi was avoided, her enemy is right beside her, and she charged in with speed quicker than the attack.
It is not easy to recover her stance from such a charge!

"Ha!"
The longsword strikes.
The attack is the quickest, even if it may not be as quick as the demonic technique.
But.
Her attack is a bit quicker than his.

"Gunu."
He closes his mouth.
He shuts his lips tight and tenses up so that he will not fall down.
Blood from his lungs fills his mouth, but he swallows it so that it will not spill out.
The golden-haired girl is below him.
The way of the swordsman does not allow him to dirty her with his blood.


Saber does not say anything.
Her golden hair flutters down to the ground.
...It is a wonder that her head is still attached.
...It is a miracle that her limbs are still attached.
...She felt that her body would be slashed the instant she went into that opening.

That was the only difference.
The longsword...
The swordsman's technique would have stayed invincible if his longsword had not been bent.

The air is shaking.
Another battle is still going on behind the mountain gate.
"......"
Unsure of what to say, Saber looks up at the dying swordsman.
To that...

"Go."
The swordsman tells her without looking at her.
How much meaning was contained in that word?
Saber pulls out her sword and runs up the stairs.
She does not turn back to the swordsman.
She runs to fulfill her role.

"HahI thought she was a beautiful bird, but she turned out to be a lion."
He murmurs as if that was to be expected.
She avoided something that even a sparrow could not avoid, so she cannot be something that is admired.

"Hm. I was confident in my skills to see through women. I guess I need more training in that as well."
The swordsman complains with a shrug.
His elegant clothing has lost its colors already.
His stomach is pierced and his bloodstained feet are vague.
He looks down at them and sits.

The branches shake.
The wind coming down from the top of the mountain rustles the forest.
And when the flowers scatter, the wind stops, and the moon darkens...
...The swordsman has disappeared without trace, as if his existence was just an illusion.
At that instant...
I develop the strongest weapon I have projected.
But it doesn't even serve as a shield.
The sword of separation.
The mysterious sword cuts through the wind, destroys six Noble Phantasms, and cuts my body apart.

It's disappearing.
The circuit is disconnected, and Tohsaka's magical energy disperses without a place to go.
"Da
mn."

I curse my worthlessness.
I knew that I'm unskilled. I curse myself for never thinking twice.
Why is this all the magical energy I have?
Just a bit more...
If I could reach into that darkness just a bit more, I could have fought like him

I fall to the ground.
I fly through the air and crash to the ground with great force.

I don't feel pain from the landing.
I don't have such a sense anymore.
Even my mind is going blank.
...Before I die.
The only thing filling my head is the surprise that my limbs are still attached.

"So that is all you can manage? I guess a fraud is just a fraud. You cannot save anyone."

...My heartbeat gets weaker.
My lungs do not move, rendering me unable to breathe.

"It would have been more fun if I let Archer live.
 He was a faker as well, but his ideal was not vulgar."

I can't see anything, but it seems it's not because my eyes are broken.
My organs are just too messed up to function as they should.
Maybe it's fortunate.
I don't have any sense of pain, so I should be able to die easily

"Oh. I remember, now that I think about it. He said your ideal is a borrowed one. How conceited of you to think that you can manage anything when you have nothing you created yourself."

I can't do that.
Even if I might go crazy from the pain, I need to regain my consciousness.
The deep part of me says so as it points to that place.

"A superhero? A world where no one gets hurt?
 Ridiculous. No world can preserve happiness without harming anyone.
 Humans cannot live without sacrifices. 'Peace' is a myth created by those who cower in fear of the dark.
 You lowlife. Your ideal is just an excuse to cover up your ugliness."


I raise my arm which should not be moving.
My fallen body and my dying mind.
I raise my hand to grab something, like I did on that day.

...I don't know what's funny, but someone's laughing.
It seems like everyone in this world is laughing.

A fake wish.
A borrowed ideal.
Someone scorning me, saying that my dream won't come true.

...Yes, that's exactly right.
My wishes are all borrowed.
I just admired the wish of wanting to help someone because it's beautiful.
So there's nothing that came from within me.
My body has always been driven by a curse-like obsession with helping others.

That's why it's a fake.
Such an imitation cannot save anything.
First of all, I'm not sure what needs to be saved.

But.
But I still felt that it's beautiful.

It was not born from within me.
I just saw someone save others and copied that behavior.
I was empty back then.
Everyone died, and I could not save anyone.
I could not bear the fear in front of me unless I gave up, saying that humans are weak.

That's why...

That's why I admired the ideal.
Because it was something I did not have, and its sanctity brought tears to my eyes.
Is that wrong?
Is it a fake if it's not mine?
Even if my wish is fake, is it wrong for it to come true?

No. I don't think it's wrong.

"AhAh."

I don't care, even if it's fake.
I'll make it come true, even if it's an impossible ideal.
It's an impossible wish from the start. An unreachable utopia.

Then, even if Emiya Shirou is a fake...
What's there has to be true.

"That's right. I already knew that."

I know that I can't save everything.
I know that there's no help without sacrifices.
I know that reality is like that because I became an adult.
I know it's only an ideal, but I still continue to seek it.

It's not the end after someone gets hurt.
Even if the best possible outcome has someone get hurt to save many others, I still want to pursue a resolution where nobody is hurt.
That there is no justice in this world, and that people die meaninglessly in reality...
I don't think such words are right...!

And he reaches this place at the end.

What I believe in.
What I believed in.
He said that they are all a fake.

But the one who said so followed through on his hypocrisy.
...Then I can keep going.
I don't care, even if it's a fake.
First of all, I'm too simple-minded to worry about such a thing.

I make up my mind on this hill of swords.
...That if I can save the world in front of me, I will fight for it.
I didn't even need to think about it.
My world is small.
This small "world" is all I have ever been able to create.

That's right.
        I am the bone of my sword.

...Yes, so I can endure most things.
Emiya Shirou can keep his dream until the very end.
...Even if...
What I seek is nowhere.

"So that's it!"
"!?"

I raise my body.
I can move my limbs again as soon as my consciousness returns.
My body still moves.
It's a wonder that I'm still alive, let alone moving, after his attack, but I don't care.

If I'm alive, there must be a reason why.
It's just that I don't know why.

"Did you project a shield...? I was reluctant to use that sword, but it should have been fatal.
 You are rather tenacious, boy."

"You were reluctant...? Heh, what's there to hold back when you have so many weapons?"

I keep my distance while I catch my breath.
I know how to do it now.
I should be able to do it with the backup from Tohsaka.
The problem is the casting.
Even though I have it memorized, I don't know how fast I can get it working until I try

"Heh. That was a sword that only a ruler is allowed to use.
 I showed it to you for the fun of it, but it is not something to be used against a lowlife.
 Saber is the only one allowed to fight against it.
 I will not be able to face Saber if I sully it on one such as you."

Numerous Noble Phantasms appear.
But they are all third-rate.
The difference is obvious after seeing that previous sword.

But they are not something I can take lightly.
They are more than enough to kill me.
The difference in our powers is the same.
Even though I managed to survive the previous attack, I cannot match that Servant with my projection.

"Oh, are you done with your copying? So you finally understand that it is useless, huh?
 Then disappear. I will not even leave a piece of your copying brain behind!"

The Noble Phantasms are released.
But...
"Shirou...!"
A blue rushing wind repels them.

"Saber...!"
Gilgamesh jumps back instantly.
Even Gilgamesh is cautious against Saber.
He wants to avoid hand-to-hand combat with her, as his technique is inferior.

"Good. Are you all right, Shirou?
 Sorry that I am late. I will take over now. Please stay away"

"No. I can manage Gilgamesh by myself. You're the one to go, Saber."

"Wh"
"at?"

"W-What are you saying, Shirou...!?
 You will fight him in that state of yours? No, a magus cannot match a Servant in the first place. You should know that...!"

"Yeah. But Gilgamesh and I are an exception. Trust me.
 I'll probably be able to beat him."
...Saber gasps.
Saber is surprised because she believes my words.

"Please hurry to the back, Saber. Tohsaka is stopping the Holy Grail by herself. You're the only one who can destroy it."

She closes her eyes once.
A few seconds... No, it's not even for a second.

"Good luck. I will go save Rin."
She says what I want to hear the most and steps away from Gilgamesh.

Her silver armor turns away.
"Saber."
I stop her just once.

"I could not save you."
And I say it.
I say it in place of the one who cared for her.

"I don't think that Holy Grail is the one you seek.
 ...Go take a good look at it so that you won't make a mistake next time."
"Shirou?"

"...Sorry. I can't put this into words real well. I guess I wasn't fit to be your Master.
 So"
I couldn't even figure out your true desire.

"That is not true. You are my Master, Shirou."
"Saber."
"I shall go fulfill my role as a Servant. We shall talk afterwards."

She runs without turning back.
She is gallant and looks like the wind.

Saber has left.
She believed in my promise that I would win and went to save Tohsaka.

Let's start.

I have no hesitation now.
All that's left is for me to defeat the enemy in front of me.

"Fuhaha, hahahaha!!!!!"

"Are you mad? You are letting go of your only chance of victory so that you can save that girl?
 Idiot. It is a lie to sacrifice yourself. You are a true hypocrite for not being able to realize that.
 Yes, I shall praise you for that."

The Noble Phantasms are set.
There are about thirty of them.
If I want to block them, I'll have to create it.

"...Imitations, faker, huh? Yeah, that doesn't sound too bad. I certainly am a faker."
I raise my arm.
I close one eye and look inside of me.

"Hm?"
"...I had the wrong idea. My magic isn't creating swords. First of all, I can't do such a skillful thing."

That's right.
Tohsaka said it too. I can only use one kind of magic.
Strengthening and projection are just a byproduct of it.

"...That's right. There's only one thing I can do, and that is to put shape to my mind."
I grab my right hand with my left and glare at Gilgamesh.

"I am the bone of my sword."
I cast the spell.
Casting is only a suggestion to change myself.
These words are to connect Emiya Shirou.

"I see. I am done with hearing your nonsense."
The numerous Noble Phantasms are released.
I'll make it.
This is why one of my eyes is open.
I pull out a shield from the hill to block the oncoming Noble Phantasms!

"Guh!"
The swarm of swords batter against the shield.
The shield is me myself.
My body breaks up as each petal of the shield is pierced and damaged.

"Steel is my body, and fire is my blood."
There's only one place I need to reach.
The flowing power fills me to capacity in an instant.

"What?"
What caused his shock?
Is it his Noble Phantasms that cannot penetrate through a single shield, or is it the magical energy in front of him?

"I have created over a thousand blades.
 Unaware of loss.
 Nor aware of gain."

It breaks.
The overflowing magical energy cannot be controlled.
Magical energy ten times the capacity of the circuit breaks its foundations trying to escape
"I cannot break through?"
Blood trickles from my mouth.
The shield is full of holes now.
Even though the Noble Phantasms did not reach me, my body is full of holes.
But still
"Withstood pain to create weapons.
 Waiting for one's arrival."
The magical energy rages around.
But I don't care.
This body is a circuit specialized to use this "one magic" from the start.
Then there should be more.
There should be something beyond this if I can't make it with this circuit.

...No, it is already there.
It's just that I can't see it.
There was no limitation to the circuit from the start.
If it was darkness, not a wall, that stopped the magical energy...
Then the limit is somewhere beyond the darkness

"I have no regrets. This is the only path."

Magical energy ten times the capacity of the circuit breaks its foundations trying to escapeand I use a hundred circuits to take in a thousand times the capacity.

"My whole life was 'unlimited blade works'"

I cast the true name.
At that instant.
Everything breaks and everything reforms.

Fire runs.
The fire becomes a wall and creates a border, changing the world.
A desolate land remains.
A hill with numerous swords.


What does he think of the scenery?
The golden Servant stands there with a gruesome expression.

"...That's right. I don't create swords.
 I create a world that contains infinite swords.
 This is the only magic allowed for me."

A desolate land.
A graveyard of swords, devoid of life.
Every sword exists in this world, as swords are reproduced just at a glance.

This is Emiya Shirou's world.
A Reality Marble.
It is the greatest forbidden magic that embodies the caster's internal world.
This is heroic spirit Emiya's Noble Phantasm and the only weapon I possess.

Everything is here, and nothing is here.
That is why this is called Unlimited Blade Works.
This is the only definite answer obtained by the one who lived as a sword all his life.

"Reality Marble. So this is your ability...!"
I take a step forward.
Stuck in the ground next to me are the swords that are floating behind Gilgamesh.

"There's no need to be surprised. These are all imitations.
 As you say, these are all trifling swords."
I reach out my arms.
The swords come out as if to accept me as their user.

"But there is no rule that an imitation cannot defeat the original.
 If you say you are the original, I shall surpass every one of your weapons and destroy your existence."
I move forward.
In front of me is the Servant with a thousand treasures.

"Here I come, king of heroesdo you have enough weapons in stock?"

"Hahyou forget your place, lowlife!"
The enemy opens the "gate" and readies numerous Noble Phantasms.
I run across the deserted land.
The two groups of swords start the final match.
You...
IDIOOOOOT!!!?
What a shock! I did not think someone would see this Tiger Dojo!
Oh Shirou, how shameful of you to die!
I have no advice to give!
Quickly go back to the choice and go finish the match!
Hi, is everyone doing well!?
Since Taiga is gone...
 Some special advice for all of you!
I bet everyone's troubled by how to get to Rin's good end, right?
This is a hint corner for people like you!
I have specially called for Senpai!
Senpai, how exactly can I get to the good end!?
Bring back on the 3rd night.
Go see how she's doing on the 5th morning.
Make her happy on the 8th day after school.
Talk in the dojo on the 10th night.
Dojo on the 15th night.
That's too exact, Senpai!
So we have to do all this!?
Nope. You only have to do four of these.
There's two that you don't have to do.
You can't get past the 12th day if you're too occupied with Saber.
Osu, thank you!
I guess that's how it is, so please start over from the 3rd day if you have some time!
