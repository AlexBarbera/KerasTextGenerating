"......"
I shouldn't even need to think twice about it.
I'm a novice, and Tohsaka is at her full potential as a Master and a magus.
Considering the events yesterday, it'd be smarter to join up with Tohsaka.


......I touch my stomach, the place I got cut.
It's wrapped in bandages, and touching it sends waves of pain and nausea through me.

...It's only natural.
I wasn't just cut, I was almost split in half.
Thanks to Tohsaka and Saber, I'm still alive. But as long as Berserker is after me, I'm a dead man.

"......"
But something still lingers in the back of my mind.

The black giant called Berserker.
The girl in white, accompanied by the strongest Servant.
The innocent, whimsical, and cruel girl, Ilyasviel.
Ilyasviel von Einzbern.
That's the name Shinji's grandfather said.

"Emiya-kun. I want to hear your response."
"OhI'm sorry. I was thinking about that Ilya girl.
 Joining up with you means we'll be fighting her, right?"

"Yes. She's ready to fight, so we just need to retaliate.
 We need to defeat all the Masters anyway. If she wants to kill us, we should do likewise."

"......"
Tohsaka's mind is made up.
In Tohsaka's mind, that girl is just an enemy that must be defeated.
But
I know there's something wrong with me for thinking this way, but I don't want to fight her.

"Emiya-kun? I hope this isn't the case, but don't tell me her looks are deceiving you."
She glares at me.


She's sharp.
I didn't realize it, but my hesitation seems proof that I was being deceived.

...She is Berserker's Master.
If she has such a strong Servant, she must be a powerful magus. I shouldn't focus too much on her outward appearance.
I shouldn't, but

"I'm sorry, Tohsaka.
 I'm glad you're worried about me, but I can't give you the response you want. This is a serious matter, you know? I feel I shouldn't rush to a decision."
I look directly back at her and answer.
Tohsaka narrows her eyes a bit and nods emotionlessly.

"Then negotiations have failed. ...Well, you have a point too. If you really want to win, you can't trust anyone."
"That's not it. I trust you, Tohsaka. It's just that I can't decide on my own. If I'm Saber's Master, I can't make a promise without her consent."

"I see. That is true. You are a Master now."

Giving a nod of understanding, Tohsaka turns away.
She strides to the door, her hair fluttering behind her.

But just before leaving, the girl who could have been my ally gives me one last look, and...
"Goodbye. We will be enemies the next time we meet."
...Like the girl Ilya, she leaves a cold warning.
"Master. I have simplified things, but that is all the explanation I can give you."
"Okay. It was quick, but I get it now. Sorry, Saber."

"...You should not be 'sorry'.
 If you understand the situation, you should be deciding on a plan of action."
She leans forward expectantly.

...I see.
Saber is the same type as Tohsaka: attack first.
That's good in its own way, but I can't decide what to do when I don't know what we should be doing.

"Hmm... We should wait and see... but we can't afford to do that. I don't know anything about the other Masters and I'm curious about the Ilya girl. ...We should be going out in search of other Masters, but"

I think it's dangerous to wander around aimlessly.
...Damn.
Maybe I should have cooperated with Tohsaka.

"Ilya...? What about Berserker's Master, Shirou?"

"Huh...? Oh, no. I'm just wondering why she's after us.
 And that wasn't the first time I met her. I've met her once before, and I've heard the name Einzbern before as well."

"......"
Then.
After hearing the name "Einzbern," Saber gives me a hard look.

"Saber? Do you also know the name Einzbern?"
"...Yes, I do. Let me ask you instead. Do you not know of that name?"

"Well, I've only heard of it. An unrelated guy asked me how the Einzbern girl was doing before I even met her."
"......I see. Then you have not heard anything."
Saber closes her eyes and ponders.

"...This must be fate. You should go to the church if you would like to know about the Einzbern family.
 That priest should be able to answer your questions and guide you to the path you must take."

"The church...? You mean the church we went to yesterday? But he told us we shouldn't go back there unless I want to revoke my Command Spell."

"He must have said that for expediency's sake. That rule is only part of the face he puts up for his association. It has no power if you are not part of their association."
"Hm..."

...That is certainly true.
Tohsaka belongs to the Magic Association, but we don't.
We wouldn't gain anything from following their orders, so we can ignore them.

"Do you understand? That place may be a last resort for you, but are under no obligation to follow their orders."
"You're right. But I still want to avoid that place... And I don't think I should go see that priest too much."

Kotomine Kirei.
That priest feels strange.
It's not that I feel enmity or danger.
...I must not see that man.
I'm scared because I might crumble in front of him.

"I understand how you feel. I do not want to have business with him if I could help it."
She declares this with a straight face.
"...?"
That's unexpected.
I never thought heroic spirits would have difficulty dealing with human beings, and most of all

"I know I don't like him, but why don't you?
 You haven't even met him, right?"

Saber hesitates.
After frowning, she lifts up her face as if to shake off her hesitation.

"He took part in the last Holy Grail War.
 I do not know which Servant he had, but Kiritsugu always took him seriously."

"Huh?"
I know that.
I know that, but what did she just say?
"Saber... Why do you know my father's name?"

"I was Kiritsugu's Servant.
 Emiya Kiritsugu was a Master in the last Holy Grail War. He cooperated all the way through to the final fight.
 During the war, Emiya Kiritsugu saw the priest as his greatest enemy. He believed the priest was the only one who could defeat us."


Hold on.
Then what?
My father was a Master in the last Holy Grail War, fought along with Saber, and
He's part of the cause of that disaster?

"You're lying. That can't be true. Then why didn't Kotomine tell me? Why didn't my father tell me about it?"

"I do not know. I could never understand what Kiritsugu was thinking.
 But I am sure the priest did not tell you because you did not ask him. He is a man who will answer you if you ask. He will tell you the truth if you inquire him about it."


Saber stares at me silently.
The meaning of being a Master.
Her green eyes tell me to go to the church of my own will if I want to know about Emiya Kiritsugu.

"......"
I head to the church.
Saber must plan to watch over me, since she's following me in that outfit.

"......"
I look up at the church.
...Even though Saber urged me to come here, I'm still not prepared.
I don't feel like going in there to ask the priest about what happened ten years ago.

"Master."
I turn back to the girl behind me.
"I shall wait here. Please face the priest yourself."

"...I know. I came this far, so I won't back down now."
"Please do not tell the priest that I was summoned.
 You should not tell him that the same heroic spirit was summoned twice."

"Okay. I'll ask him only about Kiritsugu. I'll be back quickly, so wait for me here."
"...Very well. Please be careful, Shirou. Call for me if danger approaches. That priest makes me uneasy. I do not know what will happen to you if you let your guard down."

"I feel the same way. Don't worry. I'll escape and call for you if anything happens."
I take a step onto the stairs.
I enter the church, leaving Saber under the winter sky.

I don't see the priest in the chapel.
In his place, I see a man sitting in a chair.
His hair is golden.
He must be a foreigner.

"Excuse me. Is Father Kotomine here?"
I ask him, not expecting a response.


The man slowly gets up.
At that instant...
All my muscles stiffen up.

He walks to me.
There's something odd about that simple action.
He is walking towards me in a casual manner.
That's all he's doing, sowhy am I getting ready to be killed by this man?

"Oh"
The man raises his arm.
It reaches out for my neck and
...Stops midair.

"Hm. You are entranced by something unpleasant."

He withdraws.
Yes, that is only natural.
I'm actually the strange one for thinking he was going to kill me just because he was coming closer.

"Wait right there. You have business with Kotomine, right?"
He disappears behind the altar.

"......"
Several minutes pass.
"I am surprised. Have you retired after only half a day, Emiya Shirou?"
Kotomine appears, greeting me with that annoying tone I remember from last night.

"That's not it. I came here because I have something I want to ask you. I wouldn't come here for any other reason."
"Very well. I am a busy man, so I do not want people to be attached to me."

Kotomine draws closer, his firm footsteps filling the air.
...Is this what you would call invisible pressure?
He has a severe air about him that makes people conscious of their weakness.
It must be a good characteristic for priests, but could it also be their greatest fault?

"What is it? Go ahead and ask if you have a question.  There is no need for greetings between us."


...He's right.
There's no need to be friends with him.
I came here to confirm what Saber told me.
I should ask him and quickly leave.

"There's only one thing I need to ask you. Why didn't you tell me about it?"
"Hmm. What did I not tell you?"
"It's about my father. Why didn't you tell me that Emiya Kiritsugu was a Master in the previous Holy Grail War?"
He smiles.
He does not look guilty. ...This man is enjoying the fact that Kiritsugu's name came out of my mouth.

"Answer me. It's natural for you to know if you're the supervisor of the Holy Grail War. So why didn't you tell me about it?"

"Is it not obvious? What good would it do to you to know that your father was a Master? Emiya Kiritsugu's achievements have nothing to do with you."

His disinterested tone shows no opening for a rebuttal.
Kotomine's answer isn't wrong.
Even if my father was a great Master, it doesn't mean I get any benefit out of it.
But

"...No, there is a connection. Did I become a Master because I'm Kiritsugu's son?"
I was raised as his son, and I studied magic as his apprentice.
I became a Master just like him, and made a contract with the exact same heroic spirit. There has to be a meaning behind all this.

"You said I became a Master by chance.
 I would've chosen to fight then and there if you'd told me that Kiritsugu was a Master. Why didn't you tell me about it?"

"That is none of my concern.
 I have never heard of a Master's title being hereditary, and in any case, you are not Kiritsugu's son.
 It is rare for an unprepared person to be chosen as a Master."

"The Command Spell is usually not given to someone who knows nothing of the Holy Grail. I do not know why you were chosen as an exception."

"...Then I really don't have a connection with my father?
 I was chosen to be a Master by chance, and my father saved me because..."
...He saved me out of pure good will?

"As far as I know. But I cannot understand the intentions of the Holy Grail. I would like to say that you were chosen to be a Master by chance, but I suspect fate had a hand in this.
 The Grail might want you to atone for Emiya Kiritsugu's sin of denying its power."

"What...? My father denied the Holy Grail?"
"That is right. Your father came to this town to obtain it.
 His sole purpose was to obtain the Holy Grail. The Holy Grail answered his pure wish, and maybe the Holy Grail thought he would be a fit owner."

"But Emiya Kiritsugu betrayed the Holy Grail.
 He destroyed the Holy Grail at the very end. To end the Holy Grail War, he betrayed the Holy Grail which placed expectations on him and its longstanding desire."

"He destroyedthe Holy Grail...?"
If that's true, the Holy Grail certainly would not approve of Emiya Kiritsugu.

But he wasn't mistaken.
A Holy Grail that grants any wish.
Magi kill each other to obtain it.
...The Holy Grail is the cause of the conflict.
My father did not betray anyone when he destroyed the Holy Grail.
He ended the Holy Grail War as the superhero I always admired.

"...He didn't betray anyone. Kiritsugu destroyed the Holy Grail probably because he thought there was no need for it. Kiritsugu did not betray anything."

"Hm. It seems you do not know what Kiritsugu was like before.
 All right. There is little point to it, but I shall tell you the true identity of Emiya Kiritsugu."
The priest smiles.
It is the ominous smile of someone intoxicated with delight.

"Emiya Kiritsugu.
 He was a magus unrelated to the Holy Grail War. He lived for his desires and objectives, and sought the Holy Grail as a result.
 A miracle he could not make come true himself.
 An ideal he could not implement with mere human power.
 He could not cast away his immature dream that should have been given up, and that is why he sought the Holy Grail to make his wish come true."

"I do not know where he heard about the Holy Grail War.
 It might have been that someone else deemed him worthy. But I do not care how it happened."

"Either way, Emiya Kiritsugu was hired as a Master.
 He was named the greatest Master by the Einzbernsthe family of magi that is the cause of this ritual."

"Having learned from the previous three wars, the Einzbern family sought a Master specialized in battle.
 The magic of the Einzbern family is not suited for battle. Therefore, they put their trust in Kiritsugu, a strong magus who did not belong to the Magic Association."

"They taught Kiritsugu about the Holy Grail, gave him power as a Master, and gave him a woman to produce a successor who would be more suited to combat.
 He would be formally accepted into the Einzbern family if he obtained the Holy Grail. It was like accepting a commoner into a noble family.
 The Einzberns treated Kiritsugu exceptionally, and it is easy to imagine how much trust they had in Kiritsugu."

"And Kiritsugu answered their trust.
 Kiritsugu defeated many Masters in the previous Holy Grail War. I am the only one who survived after fighting him. Everyone else was killed for sure.
 He was precise, careful, brutal, and cruel. He showed no pity for his enemies. Once the decision was made, he killed. He killed a Servant, let the Master beg for help while crawling on the floor, and ruthlessly shot him in the head. He showed no emotion even after killing. Neither the supremacy of his strength nor guilt in killing the weak."

"In short, he was a machine.
 He did not have any emotions to begin with. There was no space for his human emotions to enter."

"Whatmy father was a machine...?"
"Yes, he killed.
 He did not think like you about not involving innocent people. He thoroughly attacked his enemy's weakness, allowing no chance to counterattack. He used the enemy's family as a shield and their friends as their shackles to win the war."

"Yes. If Kiritsugu were in this war, he would be the Master you would hate the most. If being heartless is evil, he would be the greatest evil of all."


"What? Are you not satisfied?
 I understand. Emiya Kiritsugu is not a machine.
 He threw away his personal feelings for his goals. It was both his strength and weakness to cast off his emotions through his own will without even using self-suggestion.
 It would have been easy to prepare another 'cold-hearted' personality in him, but he must have believed such a person would not obtain the Holy Grail."

"He went so far, butthat same weakness made him betray everything.
 The Einzberns entrusted their longstanding desire to Kiritsugu.
 The Holy Grail appeared after five Masters were defeated.
 It was a wish that no human could make come true, a wish Emiya Kiritsugu desired."

"But he threw everything away at the last moment.
 That is the end of the last Holy Grail Warthe true nature of the magus you call your father."

"The Holy Grail disappeared and the Holy Grail War ended.
 The Einzberns retreated after being betrayed by Kiritsugu, and they spent ten years preparing the next Holy Grail."

"...Hm. Now that I think about it, they must have seen this Holy Grail War coming.
 The previous war ended without any result.
 Unused magical energy carries over to the next war. They must have known the next war would begin shortly."

"......"
I can't accept Kotomine's story.
That Kiritsugu was a cold-hearted Master...
And that a noble family of magi had a connection to my father...

There's no way I can accept it all when it all comes so suddenly.
...All I can tell from this is that Kotomine did not lie, and

"Kotomine. Did you hate Kiritsugu?"
The man before me, the one who is uninterested in everything, actually displays anger towards Kiritsugu.

"Of course. We were at the opposite ends of the spectrum. We are natural enemies. Makiri and Einzbern considered us as the same kind, but we treated each other as natural enemies."

"...Natural enemies? You were on guard against my father like he was on guard against you?"
"No. We simply could not ignore each other."

"He was a saint beyond help.
 He could not forgive death, yet he killed to save other people. If one sacrifice were needed to save ten, he would kill the sacrifice himself without a second thought."

"He always prepared the minimum sacrifice to make his dream world where everyone could smile.
 That contradiction.
 A contradictory ideal is something I have as well, but we were not of the same kind."

"He lived for his ideal. He pursued his ideal until the moment he destroyed the Holy Grail.
 That is why he had pride in himself, allowing him to become a machine without hesitation."

"That is our similarity and our difference.
 He had an iron mind unplagued by inner conflict.
 The reason he was never woundedwas he was wounded from the start.
 He was an artificial brute, just as I was an artificial priest."

"......"
'He was wounded from the start'.
So that means the premise he believed in was wrong from the start.

"...Then are you saying you're different? You take wounds, and you're not already wounded. You're a normal human being that can be wounded if you get slashed at, right? Are you saying you're different from Kiritsugu because you're a priest...?"

"Hm. People would not consider us to be the same if that were the case.
 People thought we were similar in another aspect.
 ...Let's see. If you talk about being similar, you are more similar to him than I."

"You both have child-like ideals.
 Believing in simplicity and shouldering the role of a criminal for the sake of that ideal.
 Turning yourselves into the greatest evil to eliminate all the small evils in this world.
 You and Kiritsugu act like the saviors we call 'anti-heroes.'"

"......? What is this anti-hero thing?"
"It is what it sounds like. It is the opposite of a hero, an unforgivable murderer."
"Hey, that's just a villain. Are you making fun of me?"

"Oh my. It seems you are misunderstanding me. I am welcoming you. You are Kiritsugu's son. Think about having your enemy's son come to you for help. It is such a complex feeling that you cannot decide whether to be happy or sad."

The priest laughs silently.
...I don't know his true intentions, but he doesn't seem to be bored.

"Well, about the anti-hero.
 They are beings whose existence itself is evil, but their actions are good deeds according to people. They are beings who people set up as saviors, even if they don't want to be."

"Those are the heroic spirits called the anti-heroes. An example of this would be a sacrifice."

"Even if the sacrificed one is evil, he would become a hero if everyone in the village is saved because of the sacrifice, right?
 It would not matter to anyone whether the sacrifice was eaten or buried.
 If the one whom this disgrace was forced upon saves people, he would become a hero instead of a sinner."

"...... Is this like getting a high promotion for dying in combat?"

"No, you are wrong.
 The important part is the minds of the people who set up the hero.
 A proper hero is created from respect, gratitude, and feelings of guilt. You cannot become an anti-hero from gratitude or guilt.
 ...Well, humans forget their ugliness and substitute farce with tragedy. Heroes who died as evil will be treated as victims as time goes on, and they will not stay as pure evil."

"...Will not stay as pure evil...?"
"Correct. Anti-heroes have to be both victim and assailant.
 ...They are created by the people, but are not a part of humanity. It is that contradiction which allows them to be 'the enemy of the world' exempt from all the restraining forces of the world."

"...But then, there aren't many pure anti-heroes.
 They are something that does not exist. They are merely what people wish to exist."

"They are an ideal that humans have created, sacrifices to deny the original sin.
 Just think of the anti-hero as one of the wishes that will never come true; a synonym for peace."
"......?"

"...Hah. In short, it is a naive dream that will never come true.
 You want to be a superhero like Kiritsugu, right?
 Then you will be a great anti-hero. How about it? Why don't you wish to become a hero when you obtain the Holy Grail?"

"...Hey now.
 A superhero isn't like a hero. I don't know what you're trying to say, but I won't fall for your cheap tricks."

"Oh?  How is it different?"
"I-I don't know! It's just different, okay!? And a hero is not something you try to be, but something you are at the end. I bet the only thing the Holy Grail can give me is powers beyond my position."

"I see. So you truly are a son of his, even if not blood-related. You both are hard-headed."
He must be making fun of me, as his smile is friendly.

"Hm......"
...This guy hates my father.
But he doesn't anger me because...
...Well...
He has yet to say anything bad about my father.

"Hey. Wouldn't you have gotten along with my father?"
I ask him when I realize this.

"Oh. Why do you think so?"
"...For no reason. I just thought so."

"Then you are mistaken. I hate Emiya Kiritsugu.  We never even spoke. The one time we met, we tried to kill each other.
 I have already told you that we are exact opposites.
 Our wishes, our questions, are different. A question by the one who does not have it shall not be answered by the one who does."
His eyes tell me that is why they would never have been able to get along.

"......? 'The one who does not have it'? Are you saying Kiritsugu had something that you didn't have?"

"Yes. I could not change my will itself for something I believed in. Well, we cannot be compared since our goals were different."

"...?"
Changing your will for something you believe in...
Is that like saving ten by killing one, like he said earlier?

"You do not need to understand. Emiya Kiritsugu desired peace. Isn't it simple? But it was too simple for this complex world. He had to reject the extra parts that could not fit into that perfect shape."

"But he could not tolerate that.
 He sought a perfect shape, but still wanted to save the extra parts.
 ...But that is a miracle exceeding human power.
 There is no such thing as a world without conflict. He sought the Holy Grail to deny that fact."

"He sought his ideal, and after being faced with the fact that it was impossible, had no other choice but to rely on the Holy Grail.
 That is the end of the man who was cornered by his own ideal.
 His dream was an impossible sorcery that could only be granted by 'something that does not exist' like the Holy Grail."


A world without conflict.
Did my father really believe in such a thing?
He worked hard to become strong, but the more he matured, the more he was cornered by reality. But still, he still kept believing in his ideal and in the end, attained the miracle-granting Holy Grail.

Emiya Kiritsugu must have experienced many failures by that time.
First of all, to seek the Holy Grail means knowing your wish is unattainable by normal means.

He wore out and strayed far away from his ideal.
But my father still sought the Holy Grail.
For his ideal, and for everything he sacrificed.

"...But my father destroyed the Holy Grail. His wish was never granted, right?"

"Correct. It was his own self that betrayed him in the end.
 ...In that instant, I began to feel anger towards him.
 To be honest, I did not mind his wish. I was interested in the 'peace' that humans wish for."

"Isn't that the same for you as well? You're a priest after all, right?"
The priest nods, saying that a world without conflict is what everyone desires.

"But that is not my wish. First of all, I do not have such ordinary wishes."
"You don't have ordinary wishes...?"

"That's right. An ideal world is one that is the most comfortable. For Emiya Kiritsugu, it was a world without conflict. From the very beginning, his standard was different from mine."

"...?"
"It is a simple story. There is nothing that brings me happiness. It does not matter, let it be believing in people or having people believe in me. What other people called happiness did not bring me any joy."

He says this emotionlessly.
He is not talking to me. It's almost like a monologue.

"Well, that is all.
 I answered your question if Emiya Kiritsugu was a Master well enough."
"Uhno, hold on. It's not just my father I want to know about. Um, well..."

About my preparation for the role of Master and about how I should go about fighting from now on...
...I bet he'll laugh and make fun of me if I asked something so stupid.
I want to avoid that.
In fact, I will avoid it.

"If you have any other questions, make it short. That took longer than I thought."

"!"
...No, there was something else I wanted to ask him about.
Didn't I come to this church because I wanted this question answered?

"Aren't you concerned about the Einzberns?
 I would think they would want to kill you, since you are Kiritsugu's son."

"...! Yeah, it's about that...! First of all, who is this Einzbern? You said they are the cause of the Holy Grail War or something."

"Yes, they are the cause. I told you that the Holy Grail War is a ritual, yes? If there is a ritual, it is natural for there to be a ritualist."

"There were some magi 200 years ago who found out there is a distortion in the ley line on this land. They offered their secret techniques to each other to create the Holy Grail's activation circle.
 That was the start of the Holy Grail War. The three families involved in its creation are the legitimate owners of the Holy Grail."

"The ones that created the Holy Grail. The ones that devised the Command Spell which abuses the heroic spirits. The ones that offered the land and the technique to bore a hole into the world."

"Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka.
 They are the three families that started it all, with lineage and history far surpassing ours. The Tohsaka are the only ones from this land, but their fatherly master is that Schweinorg. Well, if the master is the kind of person I hear he is, it is ridiculous to group them according to race."

"......Hm. So the Einzberns are the leading family of the Holy Grail War?"

"In the past, yes. But they are only participants now that the Holy Grail summoning has failed and its ownership became uncertain.
 Now, their only role is to create the vessel of the Holy Grail.
 The same goes for Tohsaka and Makiri. They are just families whose members have a higher likelihood of being chosen as  Masters."

"...But the Holy Grail is what the Einzbern family proposed in the first place. Their history spans a thousand years. A family that lasted for a thousand years without spawning any branch families is rare."

"Do you understand, Emiya Shirou? The Einzbern family has only pursued the fulfillment of the Holy Grail for a thousand years.
 A thousand years. They are crazy, continuing their deeds from the time when barbarism such as mass murder was allowed for the sake of recovering holy ground.
 They are not fanatics, not obstinate, nor crazy. They just held the hopeless cross to enforce the meaninglessness."

"That is why the Einzbern magi are beyond the domain of magic. They are monsters, never straying from their path, always attempting to achieve a common goal.  Normally such people die off after a few decades.
 We cannot imagine their feeling of disgrace and frustration when they had to invite in a magus outside of their family."

"But their desire to complete the Holy Grail was stronger still.
 They repeated their mistake for 500 years. It took them 300 years to accept the fact that they could not obtain the Holy Grail by themselves.
 Andit took them another 200 years to realize that they could not obtain it unless they use their own powers."

"The Einzberns literally killed their emotions to cooperate with Makiri and Tohsaka.
 As a result, their ownership of the Holy Grail was taken away and they were reduced to mere participants in the war. They endured the disgrace, even going as far as contaminating their own bloodline by inviting in an outside magus. But unbelievably, Emiya Kiritsugu betrayed them with the Holy Grail in front of him."

"That is the connection between Kiritsugu and the Einzberns.
 And that is your connection with them."


...I see.
Then it's natural for that girl to come after me.
It's natural for them not to let their betrayer's son go if he becomes a Master.

"Do you understand now? All the Masters have some sort of burden, but the obsession of the Makiri and Einzbern families cannot be expressed into words. If the Makiri family have carried their burden for five hundred years, the Einzbern family have carried theirs for a thousand.
 If anyone has the right to own the Holy Grail, it would be one of them."

"......"
I'm at a loss for words.
No man can stand against an obsession that has lasted for centuries.

"Do not be depressed. Emiya Kiritsugu did betray them, but you do not need to condemn him for it.
 To put it another way, he held to his belief, even if it meant opposing a 1000-year-old apparition.
 He threw away everything for that purpose.
 Isn't that something to be proud of?"


...People who accepted him...
Something he protected by opposing a thousand years of history...
I'm not buying everything the priest has told me, but if it really is true

If I am to call myself my father's son, I have to follow my beliefs like he did

"What is wrong? Are you scared now that you've heard a thousand years?"

"No. I chose to fight, no matter what the reason is. I don't care what the other Masters think. I won't let something like the disaster ten years ago happen again."
I raise my head in determination.
The priest nods, apparently satisfied.

"That is good enough. If that is your reason to fight, put your life on the line as you do so. There will be more victims the longer the war lasts. Risk your life like Kiritsugu and lure your enemies in."

"...You're saying what you want because it doesn't concern you. You're telling me to be bait?"

"You have nothing else to risk, so it cannot be helped.
 Well, it is not entirely hopeless. You have no ability to detect other Masters, but Servants can sense other Servants. If you have an excellent Servant, you need only wait."


I turn my back to him.
There's nothing else I need to ask.
I've kept Saber waiting, so I should be going back now.

"Hold on. Let me ask you something. Do you know any healing magic?"
"No. What about it?"

"Well, then bring any wounded people here.
 As part of The Church, I cannot overlook any victims. I can handle all the treatments unless they are beyond help."

I stop.

"...I'm surprised. You can use healing magic? That's banned in the Church, right?"

"It is outside of our jurisdiction, but I have acquired it.
 I once had someone die in front of me. After that, I started to study it, and it seems I am more compatible with it than I thought."

"Oh, but I will ask for compensation if I am to heal you. I have to be fair as the supervisor."
"I refuse. I wouldn't come to you for help even if my life depended on it."

I turn away, and this time I really do leave.
The lights disappear.
It's eleven o'clock. We waited until the town fell asleep before we went outside.

"Well, Shirou. Are we going to the center of town?"
"......"

......Sakura's state didn't change after dinner's cleanup.
If anything, it got worse.
She lost all her energy and was absent-minded, as if she had a fever.
And on top of that, she didn't want me to walk her home, so Fuji-Nee had to take her.

"Or are you planning to go to the other town? It seems likely that other Masters are over there."

"......"
Come to think of it, Sakura was acting strange the day before yesterday as well.
She looked downcast and seemed afraid of something.

"Shirou? Are you listening, Shirou?"
"......"
"Shirou! I am asking you what we should do tonight!"
"Huh!?"
I raise my head in surprise.
Saber is right in front of me, looking angry.

"Sorry, I was spacing out. You're asking me what we should do, right?"
"In that case, I need not repeat myself.
 There is a slight distortion of the ley-line in both towns. I am certain that the other Masters are doing something. We may be able to defeat one tonight, depending on where we go."

"So you're saying we might fight a Master all of a sudden?
 ...But what if it turns out to be that girl?
 You can't beat Berserker, right?"

"Master. I am in perfect condition right now. Even though I do not receive any magical energy supply, I will not easily lose.
 ...Well, all we can do against Ilyasviel is retreat. We do not know their Noble Phantasm, so we cannot use ours yet."


The only one Saber is cautious about of is Berserker.
She does not talk about other possibilitiessuch as when we might encounter Tohsaka.
For Saber, Tohsaka is merely an enemy she must defeat.
But to me, Masters are people we have to stop, not kill.

"Saber, let me confirm. We will stop fighting when the Masters and Servants surrender. My plan is to make them use up their Command Spells so they won't be Masters anymore.
 ...Is that okay?"

"...Understood. But Shirou, if the enemy does not accept our proposition, then..."
"...Yeah, then we'll follow the rules of the Holy Grail War. They should be ready for it if they're fighting as Masters."

We start descending the hill.
We can patrol this town or Shinto.
Tonight, we will
"We'll search this town tonight. The town feels strange recently, so let's investigate here before something happens."
"I feel the same way. There are no obvious abnormalities, but I am sure we will find some clues if we search thoroughly."

...Yeah, we'll look around the residential district over here first.
We'll go down to the intersection after that and patrol the other side of town.
If we can't find anything wrong, we can go to Shinto to go look for some clues

We patrol the residential district and make our way to the intersection.
There wasn't anything wrong with our side of town.
We can now go to the hill with the Western-style houses, and maybe even go as far as the Ryudou Temple

"Huh?"
A sudden chill runs up my spine.
"Saber, this is...!"
Saber must have felt it more clearly, as she looks over towards Shinto.

...The presence I felt starts to fade.
But I'm sure I heard a scream and felt a strong wave of magical energy.

I knew it.
This is what I hoped would happen.
So why is my mind paralyzed?

"!"
I was prepared to fight.
After I almost died, my hesitation vanished.
But now my body would not move, and my head would not give any orders.

It's probably too sudden.
I didn't expect to find it on the first day.
That's why I can't move. I'm used to getting attacked, but I'm not used to doing the attacking.
How stupid of me.
I'm fine with getting killed, but I never thought that I might have to do it myself

"The scream has stopped. The presence is fading away. I do not know what happened, but the victim will not live long."


That erases everything.
The numbness throughout my body disappears.
The fear that I might kill, is overridden by the fear that I might let someone die.

"I'm sorry, Saber...!"
I apologize for my cowardice and start to run full-speed.
We run to the origin of the scream, where we will fight someone to the death.
I'm not prepared at all.
My limbs are shaking.
It's a normal reaction.
This fear will always be there as long as I don't desire the Holy Grail and lack the will to fight.

"I'm a big damn idiot...!"
That's right.
If I have a reason to fight, I must believe in it.
If my enemies are arming their minds with "the desire for the Holy Grail"...
I must defeat this fear with "the desire to stop all conflicts"!
We should go patrol Shinto where there are more people.
The priest said I must fight if I do not want any victims out of this war.
As I am inexperienced as a Master, Saber and I can only hope to lure out the other Masters.
...It's not like I want to go with his plan, but using myself as bait is the only viable plan I can come up with.

"Let's go to Shinto. If a Master is planning something evil, it should be easier to do it in Shinto than over here."
"Understood. Then let us go."

...Going to Shinto means putting myself in danger.
...I must accept the possibility that I'll be killed.
I decided to fight, so I cannot make the same mistake as I did against Lancer.


...You can say I'm a total rookie, but I've trained my mind as a magus every night.
I steel up my mind just like when I insert the Magic Circuit into my back and start out for Shinto.

We patrol Shinto for about an hour.
We found nothing amiss, and Saber detected no signs of other Servants.

"So there's nothing wrong with Shinto, huh? I thought there would be some kind of a reaction if we walked around so defenselessly."
I scold myself for being too optimistic.
I bet Tohsaka could've done a much better job of searching the place.

"No, your decisions are correct. If there is a flaw in your plan, it is simply that your skills are not up to par.
 This was not wasted time.  Although we did not find anything tonight, I am sure there will be results if we continue this every night."

"Ugh... well, I hope so."
But it really hurts to know we're failing due to my lack of skill.

"Let's go back to Miyama City. We'll search my neighborhood if there's nothing in Shinto."
"Yes. Your enthusiasm is laudable, but we must first confirm the safety in our area."

We return to Miyama City.
There's nobody on the bridge, there's no trace of cars.
We cross the bridge within the silent night.
"!?"
At that instant.
I hear a scream as I feel a chill run up my back.

"It's close by...! Saber, what is this...!?"
"It is the presence of a Servant. It seems to be coming from the park below."

"!"
My heart starts to beat faster.
I knew it.
This is what I hoped would happen.
So why is my mind paralyzed?

I was prepared to fight.
After I almost died, my hesitation vanished.
But my body would not move, and my head would not give any orders.

...My naivety makes me want to puke.
I was not prepared at all.
There's no way I could have been. My mind only pretended to understand everything and my body is not used to fighting.
Yes.
To go to battle means...
To kill your enemy before your enemy kills you.


I can't move.
I'm used to getting attacked, but I'm not used to doing the attacking.
How stupid of me.
I'm fine with getting killed, but I never thought that I might be doing the killing

"Please give me an order, Master. I do not know what has happened, but our enemy is close by. We may be able to save the person who screamed if we move quickly."


That erases everything.
The numbness throughout my body disappears.
The fear that I might kill, is overridden by the fear that I might let someone die.

"I'm sorry, Saber...!"
I apologize for my cowardice and start to run full speed.
We run to the origin of the scream, where we will fight someone to the death.
I'm not prepared at all.
My limbs are shaking as I run.
It's the right reaction.
This fear will always be there as long as I don't desire the Holy Grail and lack the will to fight.

"I'm a big damn idiot...!"
That's right.
If I have a reason to fight, I must believe in it.
If my enemies are arming their minds with "the desire for the Holy Grail"
I must defeat this fear with "the desire to stop all conflicts"!
"Ha, ah!"
I run into the park.
The magical energy emitted is strong and ominous.
It's like oil polluting a clean stream.
Even I can feel energy this thick.

Saber stops.
She has analyzed the situation before me.

"Wha"
My body trembles.
My head loses its cool and fills with disgust and hatred.

...It's like seeing vampires in stories.
A woman in black has her mouth on an unconscious woman's neck.
The dripping blood is excessively fresh.

...That thing is eating a human being.
I don't mean that it's eating the human flesh.
That woman in black is sucking out what's inside the womanthings like her mind and her memory.
The unconscious woman does not move at all.
Her skin is like grave wax.  She looks like she's been turned into a doll.


My throat can't move.
It's not that I'm surprised the vampiric woman is a Servant.
My eyes focus behind heron the clear figure that is watching over the woman in black.

"Oh wow, it's Emiya. This is amazing. It's almost one of your strong points for your luck to be this bad."

"Shinji, you"
My mind is numb.
I can't grasp the situation.
I can't make the correct decision.
Why is he here?
What is that book in his hand?
How can he laugh when there's a woman that's about to die?
Why... Why is such a ridiculous thing taking place before my eyes!?

"Hey, why are you frozen up like that? You came here because you sensed a Servant here, right? Then do what you came to do. I staged this scenario so that even an idiot like you would understand."


He doesn't sound like the Shinji I know.
His voice is high-pitched.
Just hearing it makes me uncomfortable.

"Did you kill her?"
I clench my fists.
I don't even take notice of the Servant standing right there before me.
I must be crazy.
I should be fleeing in terror from this inhumanly powerful being, but I feel no fear.
My mind is about to explode.

"What? Are you stupid!? Humans are what Servants feed on! This is my only option."


"Well, I can't help it. She says she can only feed on live people. We have to keep feeding them magical energy to maintain them. I bet you were also looking for handy prey, right?"
I don't know what's funny, but Shinji laughs.

The Servant in black does not move.
Her pose is like that of a trained war dog.
She will not move on her own.
Like a puppet, she will not move without orders from her Master.
But she will turn into a murderous devil once the order is given.

"Get out of my way."
I say this with the hound in front of me.
There's no time to waste.
That woman might survive if I hurry.

"Huh? What do you mean by that? Are you talking to me!?
 Hah, I refuse. Come on if you want some leftovers.
 That's your familiar, right?"

"Shinji."
"Come on, let's make them fight. I did this so that I could see a fight between Servants. You're a Master, right? But all you're doing is trembling in fear. You're just like that woman there!"

"So you have no intention of withdrawing?"
"Man, you're persistent. Come and make me.
 Well
 It won't matter even if you just stand there and cower. I'm going to hurt you either way."

Shinji's eyes light up with hatred.
That must have been the order, as the Servant in black jumps forward and
"Stay back, Shirou!"
Saber moves to meet the attack of the Servant in black.

The two shadows collide.
Having armed herself immediately, Saber uses her invisible sword against her opponent.

The sound of clashing steel rings out.
Saber readies herself firmly on the ground, in contrast to the Servant in black who runs through the park.

Saber cannot keep up with the speed and goes into defense.
Her long hair fluttering behind her, the enemy closes in as if to corner a slow prey.

"Hah, she's just like a stone statue! So a Servant of a third-class magus is third-class as well!"
Standing away from the fight like me, Shinji laughs.
...I don't know how he became a Master, but it seems he's not a very talented magus.
Shinji does not provide his Servant with any support.
Then he must have become a Master by chance, like me


Saber blocks another attack and stops.
She looks troubled.
She glares in irritation at her lightning fast enemy.

"Go ahead and finish her, Rider!
 We followed grandfather's orders! It doesn't matter even if we kill Emiya's Servant!"

The black shadow speeds up.
The Servant in black follows her master's orders, speeds up to cut Saber's neck, and...
...Is sliced in half.

The match is decided in an instant.
Saber's sword cuts Rider's body, and the Servant in black is blown away.
It was like hitting a sandbag with a bat.
Saber is the batter and the blown sandbag is Rider, of course.

"......What?"
The mood changes.
Shinji blankly stares at Rider, who is wounded...
"No way."
...And I blankly stare at Saber, who puts away her sword disinterestedly.

"WWhat are you doing...!?"
He scorns his Servant.
Shinji yells without running over to his Servant, who has her belly sliced open.

"Who allowed you to get beat!? I can't believe this! You're going against my orders! I became your Master, so you can't get beat by Emiya's Servant...!"

"! Ah"
Rider strenuously raises her body in a pool of her own blood.
...But she cannot get up.
Her wound is fatal. Even though she is a Servant, she will die if she is not treated soon.

"Get up and fight, you corpse! You're not alive, so wounds shouldn't matter! Hey, why are you so slow, you piece of shit...! Man, you're embarrassing me! You're making me look like I'm the weaker one!"

Shinji curses Rider.
But Saber is unable to bear it.

"Blame yourself before you blame Rider. No matter how great a heroic spirit may be, it cannot fight to its full potential if it does not have an appropriate Master."

"......! Y-Y-You idiot! I'm telling you to get up! Your role is to protect your Master! If you can't win, use your life to stop them!"

"......That is meaningless as well. You cannot heal Rider even if you use your Command Spell. Even if you move Rider using your Command Spell, she will not even serve as a shield against me.
 It is over, Rider's Master.
 I do not wish to ask, but I shall follow my Master's orders and ask for you to surrender. Will you revoke your Command Spell and admit your defeat?"

"S-Shut up! Don't you dare order me, you monster...! Get up, Rider! I'm your Master! You're my dog, so listen to your master...!"

"! , !"
Sparks are flying around.
It must be because she cannot follow Shinji's orders, as pallid electric charges are tormenting her.

What a vicious cycle.
Rider cannot fight anymore.
But Shinji is condemning her for not being able to get up, despite the fact that her injuries are getting worse and her life is draining away.


Saber reaches out for Shinji.

"Hee! Get up and move, Rider...! If you're going to die, at least take her with you...!"
Rider reacts to Shinji's orders.
Rider's body moves to follow the order that has her death as its premise.

But then...
"Enough. It seems I was tossing pearls before swine, Shinji."
...The voice of an old man interrupts.

"Huh?"
The sound of crackling flames.
"W-What...!? My book is burning...!"
Shinji's book is burning.

"Why...!? Damn, go out! Why is my book burning!?"
He frantically beats at the fire, but it does no good.
The book turns to ashes, and at the same time...

...Rider disappears.

"...Hmph. I did not expect much of you, but this is worse than I thought. I gave you a chance since you are my grandson, but I cannot help but forsake you."
Where was he hiding?
An old manMatou Zouken appears out of the darkness of the night.

"G-Grandfather? Was that you...?"
"Who else could it be but me? You almost killed your Servant. And you call yourself my successor?"

"......! T-Then why did you get in my way!? I just have to win, right!? I'm the successor of the Matou family! I knew I couldn't get beat by a guy like this...!"

Shinji runs to the old man as if to cling onto him.
As he has lost Rider, his grandfather must be the only person he can rely on.
But...

"...Fool. I did not expect victory from a failure like you. What I expected was enough pride to challenge others in spite of your powerlessness.
 But you failed miserably. You disgraced the name of Makiri. Hmph, you and your father are both disgraces to our family."

"What? I'm the same as my father?"
"You fool. You are far worse. Your good-for-nothing father left an even more worthless son.
 ...I did not mind since I had some hopes for you, but you spoiled not only the family blood, but your spirit as well.
 The Matou bloodline ends with your generation."

The old man turns away from Shinji in disgust and walks toward us.
...Saber retreats. She must have felt something ominous in the old man.

"...Hm. I see, no wonder Rider was defeated. I presume you are a famed heroic spirit. I do not think a heroic spirit as great as you was ever summoned."
"......"

"Well, it seems my life will end here. No matter how pitiful he may be, he is still my grandson. I have to save him, even if it means my death. Heh, compassion towards family members can be a dangerous thing."

...I'm surprised.
It seems the old man stepped forward to give Shinji a chance to escape.
Matou Zouken must be confronting Saber so that he can protect Shinji, the one crawling in fear behind him.

"Leave quickly. Your book of contract has burned up, and you are no longer a Master. They should not attack you again if you make it out of here alive. Live the rest of your life as meaninglessly as your father did."
"!"
Shinji glares at the old man as he retreats.


Saber does not go after him.
She must not see the point of going after Shinji, who is not a Master anymore.

Shinji crawls away.
And when he gets to the edge of the park...
He turns around once and runs off like crazy.

My stomach turns sour.
I smell rotten meat from somewhere.

"Oh, so you let him go? ......I see, I see. Killing such an insignificant weakling would only dirty your sword."

"......"
Saber stands like a statue, her eyes locked with his.
...It seems like she is protecting me from his gaze.

"Can you back away, Saber? I know this old man. I want to talk to him."
"No. This man is not human. You should not have anything to tell him, nor should you have anything to hear from him."

"...I know. But I still have something I need to ask him. Please, this will be quick. You can decide whether to fight him or not after we talk."
"......"
Saber pulls herself back a bit.
She does not back up, but she is giving me the chance to talk to the old man.

"I'm sorry.
 ...So, how are you going to explain this?"
"What? You're quite the rude one, demanding explanations of me.
 I do not mind questions, but I will not be able to answer if I do not understand what you are asking me about."

"...It's about Shinji. Why is he a Master? It seemed like you made him into one. What's going on?"

"Oh, is that what you want to ask me? I do not even need to answer a question like that. As you say, I am the one who chose him as a Master. It has been long since I retired, as you can see.
 As I cannot fight, I gave the stage to my grandson."
"You made him a Masterthat means..."

"Yes. It is like you, successor of Emiya.
 I found out that the Holy Grail would appear, and I let my grandson make a contract with a Servant. You are of the lowest seat in a family of magi.
 You should understand me wanting to entrust my dream to my apprentice."


...Then what?
Magi become Masters.
So that means Shinji knows magic, and his family is a family of magi?

"Magiare you saying the Matou family is a family of magi?"
"You didn't know? The families of Matou and Tohsaka live in this land.
 But... our bloodline has died out.
 The Tohsaka family has the right to this land. The Matou family is living, clinging onto its former right."

"Tohsaka...? Then Tohsaka also knows that the Matou family is a family of magi!?"

"Of course. We were once allies. We have been enemies ever since the ritual became violent, but we are still colleagues with a shared ambition. We are friends outside of the Holy Grail War.
 Oh, that girl has succeeded him, huh?
 I have been away for about ten years, so I do not know how talented his apprentice is."

He laughs.
I don't know what kind of feelings he has for the Tohsaka family, but Matou Zouken laughs happily.

"...You said the Tohsaka family are your allies, right? Then has the Matou family been here since the very first Holy Grail War?"

"Yes. We were formerly called Makiri.
 We came to this country with the name Matou, but it seems that was a mistake. The land here does not suit us. Our bloodline has grown thin in the past two hundred years, and you have seen the failure we now have for a successor."

"Makiri."
They are actually called Makiri.
If Shinji is from a family of magi, then Sakura is...

"Hm? Oh, it's just a play on words. It is to hide our identity, but we cannot use just anything. Even our false name has to tie in to our real name."

I don't care about that.
There's only one question that matters now.

"Then is Sakurais Sakura a Master like Shinji?"
"That is a strange question. Sakura a Master? Such a thing is not possible. It seems your father has not taught you anything."

"It's not possible...? Does that mean Sakura has no talent?"

"The problem goes far deeper than that.
 First of all, magi families have only one inheritor. You only pass magic to the inheritor unless you are a distinguished family.
 And a sister of all that. You do not need two inheritors. We would have sent her out for adoption if our family had not died out, but nobody would take her since she lacks Magic Circuits."

"Then Sakura is..."
"It should be obvious, since Shinji is a Master. As she is not our successor, she does not even know that we are a family of magi.
 ...Well, I considered using her if her brother proved useless, but we have already lost. I won't involve someone who knows nothing of the Holy Grail War."


I sigh with relief.
...That's good.
I'm surprised the Matou family is a family of magi, and it's problematic that Shinji was a Master.
But I'm relieved to know that Sakura doesn't need to concern herself with such a murderous war.

"You said you guys already lost. That means Shinji won't fight anymore? You've retired, and Sakura has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War, right?"

"Correct.  But I cannot promise that Shinji will not try anything.
 He is stubbornly determined to be a magus.
 The Matou blood has grown weak since we came to this country, and he is our last heir. Children of the Matou family no longer have Magic Circuits."

"Hmph... I do not know how he found out about our family secret. He has pride in being the chosen one, but he grew up knowing that he is inferior.
 It is likely my fault for not being more strict with him, but his character is not something that can be easily corrected. He is beyond help if he cannot give up after such a crushing defeat."

The old man starts shrinking.
No, it's just an illusion. He was backing up silently.

"Anyway, Shinji lost. We have been eliminated from this warbut will you still kill this old man, Servant Saber?"

"If what you say is true, there is no reason for me to fight.
 But there will not be a next time if it is a lie. That goes the same for your successor. If he comes after my master again, I shall kill him without mercy."

"Understood."
The old man disappears.
...What is this?
Matou Zouken melts into the night, just like when he appeared.


All that's left is this rotten smell.
I force down the feelings of nausea and pick up the unconscious woman.

"Let's go to the church, Saber. We'll still make it. He should be able to do something."
"I know. I shall take the woman."
"...? Oh, thanks, Saber."

I let Saber carry the woman.
There's no time to waste. Even though Saber is smaller than me, she is more powerful. I should let her handle this instead of trying to show off.

"I shall lead the way. Please stay behind me."
Saber starts running.
I run full speed after her so I won't get left behind.
I leave the church.
Saber must have been waiting under cover, as she appears as soon as I come through the door.

"Are you done with your inquiry, Shirou?"
"Yeah. I heard about my father and what kind of a relationship he had with the Einzbern family. He also warned me about what I should do. He's more talkative than he looks.
 He recommended a lot of things to me."

"Huh...? T-That priest was cooperative?"
I don't know what's wrong, but Saber is bewildered.


"S-Shirou? What is wrong? Did he ask for something in compensation? Kuh, why did you not call for me!? You said you would call for me if there was any danger...!"

I must have had a strange expression because Saber draws near and peers at my face.


"So what did he do to you, Shirou...!? Your wound has not healed yet. You should know something like last night could happen again if you let your guard down...!"
Saber draws even closer.


"Please show me your wound, Shirou! I am partly responsible for it. I cannot let you die without returning my debt. I have not helped you as a Servant yet. I cannot allow our contract to end like this...!"

Saber reaches for my shirt as if to rip it off.
She doesn't look scary at all, but rather...

"Kuh."
Oh, crap. I was trying to hold it in, but I my laughter spills out.
"......Shirou?"
Her hand stops.
She realizes what I've been trying to suppress and glares at me.

"Shirou. It is not good to enjoy someone else's confusion."
"!"
Her protest is so entertaining that it brings a smile to my face.

"Shirou!"
"KuhI'm sorry. I was just surprised because you were in such a panic. Um, it was a fortunate misunderstanding, or something like that."

"...A 'fortunate misunderstanding,' eh? I feel some hidden meaning in that. Are you going to explain to me what it means?"

I must have hit a nerve because she gets even more emotional.
Saber's like the class president type.
She seriously gets mad when I do something stupid. And since she's serious, her real character appears.

"What are you smiling for...!? Is it that funny that I misunderstood your condition!?"

"I'm sorry. To be honest, I'm just happy. You're really energetic right now."
"...? There is nothing wrong with my condition, but what about it?"

"No, that's not what I'm talking about. It's just that this is the first time I've seen your real personality. I'm glad I can see that you're a girl."

"Wha"
Saber jumps back.

"W-What are you saying? The gender of the Servant does not matter. We are here only to fight, so please do not get happy over such a thing."
She glowers at me, probably because she's mad or astonished.


But I somehow don't feel bad, and I'm still smiling.

Even though she's a Servant, she's as human as she appears.
I don't know about the other Servants, but the girl I made a contract with is not just a familiar that only knows combat.

She said she has not helped me yet.
She saved me from Lancer and she tried to let me escape from Berserker.
She saved my life twice, but she still thinks she hasn't helped me yet.

"I wonder if she's good-natured, or just a perfectionist."
"W-What is that look? Even if you are my Master, there are some remarks I cannot ignore. I have appropriate plans if you say anything more."

"All right, all right. I understand, so don't get too mad. I'm just saying I'm glad you're the one I made a contract with."

"W-What are you saying? I was only summoned by you.
 I did not make a contract with you out of choice. You were the one who chose me."

"It was only an accident, though. ...Yeah, that's what I regret. I wanted to make the conscious choice to choose you."

I hold out my right hand.
This is something I wasn't able to do at the very beginning.
I have to make the promise I should've made before.

"Shirou...?"
"This is a bit late, but can I? This is the only way I know how."
Without a word, Saber walks over to me and shakes my hand.
Her slender fingers.
I feel her warmth through my hand.

"Will you fight with me from now on? I need your help, Saber."
"My oath will not change. I was summoned to be your sword."

"And we both need each other's help.
 I will borrow your strength to obtain the Holy Grail. If you trust me, I will do my best to live up to that trust."

Her hand is warm.

The hesitation within me disappears without a trace.
It has been half a day since the night it all began.
I am finally able to realize that she is my ally who will fight alongside me.
We will wait until nightfall to go out into the city.
After some discussion, that is what we decided.

As Kotomine said, I can't sense other Masters.
Saber is the only one who can sense our enemies, and even then, she's only able to sense nearby Servants.

So naturally, our plan is to walk around and find information.
It's like counting on luck, but it's "risky but certain" according to Saber.

Masters aren't going to be holed up in their hideouts all the time.
If the Holy Grail War is a race, you have to do something to get ahead of the competition.
That means the Servants search for the enemy's hideout while the Masters use magic to set up traps.
We can use that to our advantage.

Lots of magical energy will be needed if either one does something. Even though I can't sense other magi, I can detect the lingering traces of their power.
If we patrol the city looking for that, I'm sure we'll find some signs of other Masters.

...This is information I'll be getting by using myself as bait.
I have no other method besides being bait, just like Kotomine said.

We'll start the patrols tonight.
Saber told me to stay at the house, but I refused, saying I would go with her.

After a long, unproductive talk...
"...All right. But please promise you will always be with me. Can you swear not to go outside by yourself at night?"

...Saber finally accepted my point of view.

Well.
Our course of action is decided, but there are two more problems.

"Shirou. I have explained to you before, but I cannot afford to use too much magical energy, especially if we plan to patrol tonight."

"Yeah. You're going to sleep as much as you can to preserve magical energy, right?
 Since I can't provide you with magical energy, you have to maintain your body yourself.
 So, say you can regenerate 8 units of magical energy per day and you need 6 units to sustain yourself daily. That excess 2 units is what we can save up.
 And if you conserve well, you could use about 10 units during a battle, right?"

"That is true as long as I am not wounded or my armor does not become damaged. But against heroic spirits of such rank, that is not likely.
 To put it in your terms, I used about 50 units against Lancer, and about 200 units against Berserker."

She was pierced by Lancer, and her stomach was slashed by Berserker.
It makes sense for her to have used a lot of magical energy to heal those wounds.
It makes sense, but...

"I did not use that much magical energy to heal myself. I used it more to restore the armor that was destroyed. Most of my magical energy is fixed on protecting me."

...That's how it is, according to her.

"So your armor is part of your body, right? So maintaining your body and your armor is the same thing. You have your armor off right now to preserve magical energy, right?"

"Yes. But things like this should not be necessary for other Servants. I can only disarm myself since I cannot turn into spirit form, but Servants such as Archer and Lancer can become spirits to reduce the burden on their Masters."
"I see, I see. ...Oh, I guess this is good enough."

"Shirou. It is helpful that you are preparing our meal, but do you not think it is easing the tension?"
"Huh? No, I don't think so."

I don't, but it is true my sense of urgency disappeared.
I was surprised when Saber told me about her condition after our strategy meeting.
As I don't provide her with magical energy, she has her hands full with maintaining her body.
I tried to change our course of action, saying that it should be impossible for her to fight in that condition, but...

"Hey Saber. Let me ask you again, but how much magical energy do you have right now?"
"In your terms, I have about 1000 units."
So it's something ridiculous like that.

She said she spent about two hundred against Berserker, but she still has that much magical energy remaining.
And she says it's not full. It's scary to think how much magical energy she would've had with a proper Master.
Her capacity is way beyond human, and I stop stupidly thinking how many times more of my magical energy it would take to fill her up.
I finally understand why Tohsaka called Saber "the most superior Servant".

"...Of course I'm not nervous anymore. There's nothing to worry about if you have that much magical energy and we only have to face six enemies."

"That is only if I am to fight them.
 I told you earlier, but using a Noble Phantasm takes lots of magical energy. It is hard to use my Noble Phantasm in my current state. Therefore I must save up as much magical energy as I can."

Saber's mad.
I can't tell if she's mad at me for being a burden, or because I'm keeping her here when she has to sleep.

"I understand your magical energy is important, but so is food, right? I used leftovers for lunch, so please eat a proper meal for dinner. You can sleep after you eat."

"......All right. I do not intend to use my Noble Phantasm lightly. We shall talk about this later when you have a better understanding of what Servants are."
Saber says this in a dissatisfied manner and takes a seat.

Good.
She might complain, but she always listens to me.
So the problem of "conserving magical energy" is settled now.
In the first place, it's not something we can do anything about, and the only way to help ourselves is to get a better understanding of our current situation.
So...

"But, Shirou. You said you have two problems. What is the other problem?"
"Huh? Oh, it'll come soon. Please do as I said."
I cut some white radishes and put them into the saucepan.

"...?"
Saber tilts her head in confusion.
There...
"I'm home! Are you cooking, Shirou!?"
"Excuse me, Senpai."
...I hear the usual voices from the entrance.

"......"
"......"
"......"
The silence is painful.
It's only natural. Fuji-Nee and Sakura are confused, and they're looking at me for an explanation.

"This is Saber. She's going to be staying at this house starting today. Please give her your best regards."

It's been ten minutes since that was my explanation to them.

This lack of protest feels awkward.
I want to take a sip of tea, but I feel like the sound of it would echo through the room, so the hot tea sits there untouched.
But sitting here won't solve anything.
I have to move forward with courage.

"We can't turn her away since she came here for my father. She won't stay long as she's only here for sightseeing. Also, she'll be staying in the separate building so it won't be a problem."

"......"
"......"
"......"

...The silence continues.
By the way...
I can understand why Sakura and Fuji-Nee are quiet, but why is Saber looking so surprised?

"Phew. Well, if she's an acquaintance of Kiritsugu-san, it can't be helped. I heard he had some relatives overseas, so, was it... Saber-san? She seems reliable, so I have no objections."

"...Um. Fujimura-Sensei, that's..."
"I'm sorry. I understand how you feel, but this is Kiritsugu-san's house. It would be shameful for us Japanese to throw out a foreigner who came here relying on us, right? It's been getting dangerous lately, so we can't just throw this cute girl out on the streets."

"......That's true, but... is this okay with you, Senpai?"
"Yeah, this is what I intended. I'm going to have Saber stay here for a while. Are you against it, Sakura?"
"...No, I do not mind if an acquaintance of yours stays here, butum, Saber is..."

"Hm? Oh, it's a strange name, right? She's blunt like her name suggests, but I guarantee she's a good person. She might sound strange since she's not used to Japan, but it'll really help me out if you can help her out, Sakura."

"......All right. If you're fine with it, then I am too."
Is she nervous because Saber's a foreigner?
Sakura nods while looking away from her.

So it's dinnertime.
I put extra effort into dinner to welcome Saber and to make up for lunch.

I made minced bonito salad, fried chicken with hot sauce, meat and potato stew, and lots of tempura including shrimp tempura.

The dinner I put so much effort into is...
Unpopular with the main guest and my pupil.

"Wow, what is this tempura!? 'Juicy' and 'tasty' don't begin to describe it! What did you do, Shirou!? I have a better opinion of shrimp now!"

"............"
Well...
It's all good since Fuji-Nee's enjoying it enough for the four of us.

Dinner ends without trouble thanks to her.
I don't know what happened, but Fuji-Nee gave some of her food to Saber.
I guess Fuji-Nee likes Saber because she is quiet.

"......"
Saber and Fuji-Nee left to prepare Saber's room.
And Sakura and I clean up after dinner.
Well, there's nothing wrong with that, because it's part of the usual chores.

"I'll wash the dishes, so can you clean the table?
 Oh, you don't have to throw away the tempura oil. Can you put the lid on it and store it? It's heavy. Can you handle it?"
"Huh...? Oh, yes. I'm stronger than I look, you know?"

She picks up the pot of oil.
Good, so since she does archery, I didn't need to worry.
"Well, archery isn't all about strength either..."
I wash the dishes.

Then...
"Huh? There's less towels here, Senpai. The paper towel roll is empty and the plates are moved around."
"What? Let's see... Oh, you're right. Did someone break in?"

"Hmm. I don't think there are robbers that only steal towels."
"Right. That's no robber."

The plates have been moved around.
The paper towels are gone.
Some towels are missing.
According to these clues...

"Oh. That's right. Tohsaka was here."
I remember now.

Tohsaka was the one who treated me after that incident with Berserker.
I'm pretty sure that she used the paper towels during my treatment.

"Senpai. Do you mean Tohsaka-Senpai?"
"Yeah. I had her come in.
 Um, I had a stupid accident and hurt myself. Tohsaka just happened to pass by and she kindly treated me. As expected from our school's honor student, right? She's so full of affection."

I don't mean the last half, of course.
My school's proud honor student died last night.
It's highly regrettable, but the image of "Tohsaka Rin as an honor student" died inside of me.

"...Why?"
"Hm?"
"Why did Tohsaka-Senpai come here? That's strange. She has nothing to do with this place. I'm here, and she has no connection with Senpai, so why?"

Sakura hangs her head and tries to control herself.
"......"
I'm at a loss for words at this sudden event.
She hugs herself tightly as if enduring some uneasiness.
The church is lit, even though it's midnight.
I took the woman from Saber and entered the church alone.
When I yelled for Kotomine, he came out and quickly retreated to the back with the unconscious woman.
He said that his room was the only place he would be able to treat her.

"Phew."
I sit down.
...I've done all I could.
Now, it's up to Kotomine.
I'll believe in him and wait.


...I keep waiting.
I'm worried about Saber, who is waiting outside, but I can't leave.

AndI want to think by myself for a while.
The Matou family was a family of magi.
Shinji became a Master and obtained a Servant.
Matou Zouken had his successor participate in the Holy Grail War, even though he lost his powers as a magus.

"......"
The Einzbern family aren't the only ones obsessed with the Holy Grail.
Makiri and Tohsaka.
No, in the first place, the only ones who become Masters are those who cling to the Holy Grail.

...Saber is no exception.
The Einzbern family has sought the Holy Grail for a thousand years.
Their persistence is not something I can do anything about.
They can only be saved by the Holy Grail.

My father went against them and destroyed it.
But would I be able to pursue my wish to such lengths?
Like the Einzbern and Makiri families...
Do I have the right to compete against those who have sought the Holy Grail for centuries?

"How surprising. I did say you could bring wounded people here, but I did not think you would bring one on the same exact day."
"Kotomine"
I raise my head.
He doesn't look gloomy.
Then that must mean the treatment was successful.

"Kotomine. How is the woman doing?"
"She survived, but the rest is up to her. If you were an hour later, I would've had to see her as a priest."

"I see. I'm sorry I troubled you.
 ...Um, I'm glad you were awake."
"You're thanking me? Are you sick? I will listen if something is worrying you."

"...I am worried about many things, and you are the cause of most of them. I'll pass on another long talk with you."

"Oh, so our conversation earlier was just a bother? ...Hm, I meant to give you a boost, but it only gave you more worries, huh? I should reflect on my actions as well."
The priest shuts his mouth, looking regretful.

"......"
It's not that I'm letting him get to me, but...
"......Um.
 A guy I know turned out to be a Master."
...Not being able to bear it by myself, I just have to say it.

The priest says nothing.
He just nods.

"So of course you defeated the Master, right?"
I nod in response to his short question.

"Then do not regret it. People cannot change the past.
 All we can do is to accept our own actions.
 If you still wish to be burdened with your sins, let it show in your future actions. It is your choice how to perceive something that has already happened."

"......"
His words are plausible.
...The problem isn't that Shinji was a Master, that the Matou family is a family of magi, or that the Einzbern family tenaciously pursues the Holy Grail.
The important thing is what I'm going to do from now on.

"I'm going home. Please take care of that woman."
I get up to leave the church.
Saber is waiting for me outside.
There's no more reason for me to stay here if the woman is all right.

"Hold on, Emiya Shirou. I shall give you one piece of advice."
"...What? I told you I'm not listening to your endless rambling again."
"I will be brief, but I deserve some compensation for being asked to treat a woman so late at night."
"......"
I can't object if he puts it like that.
I reluctantly turn around to see that the priest is right behind me.

"It is something I forgot to tell you.
 The Einzbern family has endured for a thousand years in pursuit of their one wish. Yes, it is a serious matter now that I say it. It is natural for you to be overwhelmed."
"......"
...This is why I don't like this guy.
He accurately points out my doubts even when I haven't said anything.

"...Shut up. Are you going to bring that up again?"

"No. I am telling you that it is nothing to be concerned about.
 There is no need to view this as anything special. This war is just a common thing.
 The Holy Grail War is the materialization of our everyday life and people's happiness. There is no crime in participating."

"Everyone desires something and people fight for what they want. That is what defines life. It is something shared by all, even if the scale of those desires is different.
 There isn't a person in this world who does not try to make his wish come true.
 The outcome, of course, is another matter. People may live to make their dreams come true, but some of them die before they reach their goals."

"There is an order to things. An appropriate accumulation of effort is needed to make dreams come true. This is what people call life.
 The Holy Grail simply removes the need for that effort.
 It is merely a simplification of life."

"So there is nothing special about it.
 The seven Masters are just trying to reduce the journey undertaken during their lifetimes via the shortcut called the Holy Grail.
 Everything else is the same. It is human nature to paint over others' wishes with your own.
 The Holy Grail War is no different from your life.
 Do as you please throughout this war and win."

"......"
He says cheerfully...
There is no difference between a vulgar wish and a noble one.
The quality of the wish is irrelevant.
I just need to trample over the wishes of others
...I don't know if it's sarcasm or not.
But he is seriously saying even an incomplete Master like me is worthy to fight.

"...That's not like you. Why are you suddenly worrying about others?"
"Well, it is because our talk earlier was not helpful. I cannot call myself a priest if people coming to me because they are worried leave with even more doubts."
...Man.
I bet Tohsaka would say he makes a lousy priest to start with.

"Don't worry about that. Bye, you fake priest."
"Yes. Come again if you have not had enough."
I snort and walk to the exit.
I leave the church for sure this time.

Saber is waiting outside.
...I think it was like this earlier too.
Saber waits for me in the cold winter night without complaining.

A Master and a Servant might have this kind of a relationship, but Saber is by my side because she is concerned for my safety.
I believe I have to answer her with the best honesty I have.

"That woman's all right thanks to you, Saber."
"You do not need to thank me. It was you who tried to save her. I only abided by your decision."
"!"
Her expression is very gentle.

"Oh... no, that's not true. You're the one who saved her. I wouldn't have made it in time by myself. And most of all"

I think Saber let Matou Zouken go to save that woman.
We would've ended up fighting if we stopped that old man there. She definitely would've died.
Saber took that into consideration and let him go.

"W-What is it, Shirou? Um, it seems you are smiling for no reason at all."
"Huh? Oh, I have a reason. I'm glad you're the person I thought you were. Thank you, Saber, for going along with my unreasonable plan."

"W-What are you saying? I do not think your plan is an unreasonable one"

"Really? You said I was too lenient and too optimistic.
 You looked like you might not go along with the plan when the time came."

"I-I never looked that way! I only told you that my own judgment would take priority if you were in danger! How can you doubt me, Shirou?"
Saber frowns.


I smile, since her expression is totally different now.

"Shirou. It seems I will need to teach you some manners one of these days."
"Yeah, please do if there's a chance. But Saber... Let's end this war for now."

"Shirou...?"
"I didn't need the Holy Grail like you.
 Before, I just wanted to stop the fighting, and then give you the Holy Grail if we survived until the very end. I wondered if an amateur like me was appropriate for you."

"I see. Then what about now? Tonight, you experienced a battle you chose to start yourself. Have your thoughts changed?"

"No, not at all. I'm still against the Holy Grail War.
 But I'll fight until the end for sure.
 I have no wish that I need the Holy Grail to grant.
 ...But I want to protect others, like a superhero.
 I don't think my wish is inferior. So I have to fight against the wishes of others, even if they are five hundred or a thousand years old."

"I see. That is understandable."

"Then I shall swear again.
 I will be your sword for as long as you are a worthy master. As long as you remain yourself, Shirou,I will never betray your trust."
"Ohyeah, I'll do my best, Saber."

Her direct smile is embarrassing, so I look up.
The winter's chill makes the starry sky more beautiful.

'I will never betray you.'

I look up at the night sky, a world apart from tonight's events.
The girl that waited for me in this cold weather said that.
Then I'll believe in myself...
...So that I can always be worthy of her trust.
...So that I will be able to look back on my actions without regret.
"Well."
I take a breath and analyze the situation.
I haven't had time to think since I saw that fight between Lancer and Archer last night.

"...Oh. I see. Then that must've been Tohsaka."
I finally realize it.

I was stabbed by Lancer after that, was saved for some reason, and attacked by Lancer again
"Saber saved me, and I became a Master."
What I heard at the church.
The killing called the Holy Grail War.
The Holy Grail which grants any wish, given to the winner.

...I can't absorb all the facts, but I have been attacked three times already.
So I can't sit here in confusion forever.
I said I would fight, since I could not sit by and do nothing.
I won't allow any innocent people to get hurt.

Since that day ten years ago, I have trained to become a superhero.
I never thought I would be tested like this, but I won't back out now.

I'll cast off all hesitation.
Come to think of it, this is an opportunity.
This is a chance to "help others" just like Emiya Kiritsugu.
"......"
But something lingers in the back of my mind...

    Rejoice, Emiya Shirou.

The backwards desire that should not be wished for...

    Your wish will finally come true.

...Might be a distorted wish for a superhero...

"That can't be. I didn't want the Holy Grail War."
...There's no need to hesitate.
There is nothing wrong with the wish I've had for ten years.
Emiya Shirou will become a superhero.
I have trained in magic to help others.

"All right. I need to talk with Saber."
I shake off the priest's words and exit into the hallway.

I look through the house.
I look everywhere someone could possibly be, including all the guest rooms, but I can't find her.

"That's strange... She's in that outfit, so you'd think it'd be easy to find her."
And yet I can't find her anywhere.
I guess Servants can become spirits, but I can't turn her into one anyway.
No, first of all

"Even though they call me a Master, I don't know anything about her."

I don't know who she is or how she can exist.
The only thing I understand is...
No matter how superior they are, they can still get hurt in a fight and bleed if they are wounded.

"Oh."
Saber is in the silent dojo.
But her appearance is different from yesterday.
She sits Japanese-style on the wooden floor without her armor.
Her clothes are now refined and suit her well as she sits quietly.


...I lose my voice at the sight.
Sitting with her back straight and eyes closed, Saber looks beautiful.
Melting into the silence, she reminds me of pure water.


And that removes the last of the doubts within me.
Even if she is a Servant, there's something holy about her.
SoI won't be led astray if I'm with her.

"Saber."
I call out.
Saber slowly opens her eyes and returns my gaze.

"You are awake, Shirou."
A calm voice.
Surprisingly suited to this place, her voice echoes through the dojo as if permeating it.

"Yeah. I just got up. What were you doing here?"
"I was resting. I cannot treat you, so I thought I'd make sure I was in perfect condition."

"!"
Saber looks at me as she speaks.
...Well, um...
I feel a tension, different from the kind I felt with Tohsaka.

"Shirou? What is it? Could it be that your body is still...?"
"...! N-No, there's no problem...! I'm just perplexed for my own reasons, so don't worry...!"
I take a step back and shake my head.

"...?"
Looking away from Saber, who is tilting her head questioningly, I calm my pounding heart.

"...Calm down. What am I so tense about!?"
I take a deep breath.
...But it doesn't seem to die down quickly. In fact, I don't think it ever will.
"...Man, why did she get changed...?"

I complain without meaning to.
Saber's clothes are so real that they make me conscious of her womanhood, whether I like it or not.

...She is terribly beautiful.
I thought I figured that out yesterday, but she really hits me with it now.
Perhaps her armor looked so surreal I didn't notice yesterday.
But when she dresses like a girl, I'm flustered, as any healthy guy would be.

"Shirou."
I tense up the moment our eyes meet.
But I didn't look for her just to say nothing. I'm troubled, but I can't stay quiet forever.

"All right.
 May I, Saber? It'll be the first time we sit down and talk"
I make up my mind and talk to her.
And then.

"Shirou. Before that, there is something I would like to address regarding last night."
Her previous gentleness goes away and she stops me in displeasure.

"? All right, what is it?"

"It is about last night.
 You are my Master. It is troubling if you take such actions. Battle is my duty, so you must concentrate on your role. If you go and die in vain, there is no way I can protect you."

She states it clearly.
That makes the tension I was feeling vanish.

"W-What do you mean!? You would have been slashed if I didn't do that!"

"In that case, I would have just died. It was not something you should have been hurt over.
 I repeat myself. Please do not that again.
 There is no need for my Master to protect me, and there is no reason for it either."
She says this rather simply.
It must be because she sounds so practical.

"Whadon't be stupid. You don't need a reason to save a girl...!"
I react without meaning to.

Maybe she was surprised at being yelled at, but she pauses for a moment as if I did something unexpected.
And then, she stares at me with indescribable dignity.

"Uh..."
I back up a bit, being stared at.
Her look makes me realize what I've said, and I suddenly feel embarrassed.

"A-Anyway, I'm grateful you brought me home. Thank you."

I thank her while looking away.
...It's awkward to thank her in the first place, but it's even more awkward to thank her in this situation.
But still, before anything else, I have to thank her for helping me.

"You are welcome. It is natural for a Servant to protect her Master, but I am happy to be thanked. You are very polite."
"No. I'm not polite."

So there's something I need to clarify right now.
It's something I should have asked her the moment we got back last night.
If she really is my Servant....
And if she really is going to be joining this battle...

"Going back to our conversation, Saber.
 ...Oh, I'll ask formally. Can I call you Saber?"

"Yes. Since I have formed a contract with you as a Servant, I am your sword. I shall follow your orders, defeat your enemies, and protect you."
She says without the slightest hesitation.
There's no room for argument.

"Become my sword, huh? Is that to win this Holy Grail War?"
"...? Is that not why you have summoned me?"

"No. I only summoned you by chance.
 As you know, I'm only an amateur magus. I'm sorry, but I have neither the knowledge nor the power of a Master.
 But I've decided to fight, so I'll fight. I'm an unskilled Master, are you okay with that?"

"Of course. You are my Master, Shirou.
 This fact will not change. A Servant does not have the freedom to choose her Master."

...I see.
Then I should try to respond to her to the best of my ability.

"...All right. So you're content with me as your Master?"

"Yes. But Shirou, I shall not allow defeat for my Master.
 If you have no chance of victory, I shall make one for you. I will use any means possible to have you obtain the Holy Grail.
 We Servants do not serve the Masters without compensation. We serve because we also desire the Holy Grail."

"Huh? Hold on. The Holy Grail, you mean you want it too...!?"

"Of course. After all, the only ones who can touch the Holy Grail in spirit form are we Servants, who are also spirits.
 The Master that wins the Holy Grail War will obtain the Holy Grail through the medium of their Servant. After that, the Servant who served the winning Master will have its wish granted in compensation.
 That is the relationship between Masters and Servants."


...I see.
Now that she says it, it's obvious something like a "heroic spirit" would never obey a mere human being.
Since they have their own objectives, they serve the Master in exchange.

...Then that means Saber has a wish she wants granted.
That is why she has no doubts.

But...

"...Hold on, Saber. You said any means possible, right? Does that mean you don't care what measures you take to win the war?
For example"

Doing something like what that priest said.
Involving innocent people and creating a disaster like what happened ten years ago

"Shirou, that is not a possibility.
 I can only do things I allow myself to do. I cannot betray my beliefs. It is against the knight's oath to hurt those who are unarmed."

 But I must obey your orders. You will have to use one of your Command Spells to compensate for trampling over me."
I am overwhelmed by her angered voice.


But still, I'm happy and relieved.
Her lack of doubt gave her the image of a cold fighting machine, but I know now that she is not a cold-blooded killer.

"Yeah, I won't let you do that.
 Like you said, we have to do our best with what we can do. ...I'm really sorry. I insulted you without realizing it."

"Ah... no, I leapt to a conclusion without knowing your intentions. You are not at fault, so please raise your head..."
"Huh? Oh, sorry, I apologized without realizing it."
I raise my head.


I don't know what's so funny, but Saber has a small smile on her face.

"...?"
Well, I'm glad she's smiling, so I won't ask her about it.

"...All right. Then can I ask you something else? A Master is a magus that summons Servants, right?
 That's fine, but I don't quite understand you guys. Like, Saber and Lancer, I know those aren't your real names."

"Yes, those are only the names of the classes given to us. ...Very well, I shall describe it briefly since we have the chance."

"We Servants are heroic spirits.
 We each have won fame during our lives or have accomplished some great deed beyond human ability.
 Whatever the means, we are beings that have reached the rank of gods with our own strength."

That doesn't even need to be said.
Heroic spirits are heroes that had supernatural abilities while they were alive, whose fame was such that they were promoted into the ranks of spirits after death instead of becoming mere ghosts.

"But that is also to our disadvantage. As we are heroes, our weaknesses have been recorded.
 Revealing our names, revealing our identities, means revealing our weaknesses.
 It is no problem if we fight lower spirits, but we are all capable of defeating each other. If our weaknesses are revealed, the enemy will take advantage of them to defeat us."

"...I see. Heroes usually do have opponents they're weak against. That's why you're hiding your real name and using the name Saber?"

"Yes. However, I am not called Saber only for that reason.
 There are seven Servants called forth by the Holy Grail, and every one of these is selected according to their class."

"Class...? You mean like Saber and Archer?"

"Yes. Summoning a true heroic spirit is already almost a miracle. To summon seven is too much even for the Holy Grail.
 As a solution, the Holy Grail prepares seven vessels in advance and only calls forth heroic spirits compatible with these vessels.
 Those are the seven classes.

 Saber.
 Lancer.
 Archer.
 Rider.
 Caster.
 Assassin.
 Berserker.

"The Holy Grail calls forth from all times the heroic spirits, with abilities corresponding to each of these classes.
 And those who receive these classes are called Servants."

"...I see. So you were a heroic spirit skilled with swords, so you were summoned as Saber?"
"Yes. There are heroic spirits that have multiple attributes, but I believe I am the best when it comes to swords."

"But that is also the weakness of the Saber class.
 Since I am not a magus, I can only defeat your enemies as your sword."

"So you're not well-suited to trickery. No, I don't think that's a weakness. You're powerful, so that should be enough, right?"

"Shirou, you cannot win this war just by being strong in battle.
 For instance, if your enemy is stronger than you in combat, what will you do?"

"Huh? Well... if I knew I couldn't beat them in combat, I'd have to do something without fighting"

Having said that much, I understand.
If the enemies are strong, you wouldn't fight a proper battle.
Beating opponents with your sword isn't the only way to fight.
If you can't beat an enemy head-on, you'll have to do it some other way.

"Exactly. If your enemy discovers you are skilled in combat, your enemy will most likely not challenge you in combat. ...And in that sense, Servants that lack ability will use any means possible."

"The Servant Assassin has low attributes, but has a special ability to hide its presence, and the Servant Caster is versed in magic that does not exist in this age.
 You cannot be optimistic because of a mere difference in power. And on top of that, we have our 'Noble Phantasms'. No matter what kind of Servant we are, as heroic spirits, we have our guaranteed fatal attack."

"Noble Phantasm?"
That's not a term I've heard before.
I think I might know what it means from the sound of it, though...

"Noble Phantasms are special weapons carried by Servants.
 Weapons like Lancer's lance, Archer's bow, and my sword are such.
 Heroes are not called heroes by themselves. Heroes have weapons that symbolize them and make them heroes."

"The hero and his weapon are one. So those who became heroic spirits wield a powerful weapon.
 That is the 'Noble Phantasm'the trump card for Servants, and the thing we must take the most care of."


...Saber says that Noble Phantasms are weapons that heroes wielded when they were alive.

I recall that blue knight.
The lance that absorbed magical energy from the air and pierced Saber's chest with incredible movements.
That was certainly not something fit for humans.
That lance itself carried a strong curse, but I also felt an overwhelming amount of magical energy in the word Lancer said back then.
Then could it be...?

"Saber. Are Noble Phantasms magic?
 Lancer's lance certainly seemed like a lance with history, but the lance itself wasn't extraordinary.
 But that lance went beyond the realm of weapons with his words. Isn't that some sort of magic?"

"Yes, Noble Phantasms are certainly similar to magic.
 For example, Lancer's lance itself is a Noble Phantasm, but it demonstrates its full potential only when he puts magical energy into it and says its true name."

"A Noble Phantasm could be called a materialized divine mystery.
 As spells are necessary to activate magic, recitation of the true name is necessary to awaken and to activate the Noble Phantasm.
 But that is also dangerous. By saying the true name of their Noble Phantasm, the identity of the Servant is revealed."

"...Oh yeah. Heroes and their weapons are one. If you know the weapon's name, you naturally know the identity of the owner."
Saber nods silently.

That is why the Noble Phantasm is a trump card.
In exchange for revealing the name, it launches an unavoidable fatal blow.
But when it does not prove fatal... the Servant will expose all its weaknesses.

"Then, Saber. Is your Noble Phantasm that invisible sword?"

"...Yes. But I have not revealed its identity yet. No Servants should know my true name at this point."
Having said that, Saber looks down awkwardly for a second.

"Shirou. I have a request about that matter."
"Huh? What kind of request?"

"About my real name. Usually, Servants give their true names to their Master only, to determine future plans.
 But you are an inexperienced magus.
 A superior magus would be able to read your mind, so"

"Oh, so you can't tell me your real name? ...Yeah, you're right. Like hypnotism, suggestion, or... well, I don't think there'd be any, but if any other Master had mystic eyes, I might just start babbling about it.
 All right. Let's do that. I'll rely on you to decide when to use your Noble Phantasm."

"Uhum, can you really decide that so quickly?"
"It wasn't easy. I thought it through.
 I agreed after thinking about it, so don't worry."


...Well.
I get most of this stuff, but I still don't have a grasp of the situation.

This is strange, now that I think about it.
Even though I've decided to fight, the only enemy I know is Tohsaka, and I don't intend to fight her.
Well, I shouldn't be thinking like that because Tohsaka is ready to fight me any day.

"Hey Saber, do Servants and Masters have some sort of mark? I don't really know what I should be doing."

"No. Unfortunately, there is no clear way to distinguish them.
 But if other Servants are near, Servants are able to sense them. All the more if they are materialized. Servants themselves are powerful magic.
 I am sure you felt Berserker's presence."

"Ughthat is true. But it's bad to be able to tell only when you're attacked. I need to at least know before they approach, so I can take some sort of countermeasure."

"Then, how about searching for the Master's presence? Masters are magi. Since they use magic for a living, they will leak magical energy. If you search for that, you may be able to identify the Masters in this town."
"...Sorry. Unfortunately, I can't do that sort of thing."

After all, I didn't even realize Tohsaka's real identity, and she goes to the same school as I do.
We were in the same building for two years, and on top of that, I've seen her several times.

"Geez. No wonder people call me an amateur. The only evidence I'm even a Master is this Command Spell. It seems there'll be lots of difficulties ahead."
I sigh.
And then.

"Shirou. Could you close your eyes for a moment?"
Saber speaks with a serious expression on her face.
"...? Close my eyes? Why?"
"To prove that you are a Master. Just close your eyes and breathe normally."

"......"
...I close my eyes.
I feel a faint pressure on my forehead.
Hey, it's prickling. Could this be the end of her sword!?

"Saber? Hold on, are you doing something weird?"
"...Master, please stay silent and concentrate on my fingertip. If you are a magus, you should be able to feel my magical energy."

"Hm."
I see, so it's Saber's finger that's touching me.
I pull myself together and calm down.

Then.
What is this?

"Saber, what was that?"
"You should not need to ask. You and I are connected by our contract, so it is only natural for you to be able to understand my status."

"Understand? You mean, what happened just now?"
"I do not know how you saw it. It is your standard that measures the Servant's ability. Some Masters classify according to color, and some classify according to animals."

"So in other words, you perceive it in a way most comprehensible for you.
 This is a standard concept for a Master, so please check frequently. Like me, once you see someone, you shall understand their details."

...I see.
I was a bit surprised since it was so sudden, but I might be able to act a bit like a Master now.
This is a story from a winter five years ago.

It was a night with a beautiful moon.
I wasn't doing anything, just watching the moon with Kiritsugu.
Even though it was winter, the air wasn't cold.
The corridor was a little chilly, but it was a good night to enjoy the moon.

Back then, Kiritsugu didn't leave the house often.
Not going outside, he would just laze around the house carelessly.
...I regret it even now, thinking back to it.
Why didn't I notice that it was like the actions of an animal that knows its time of death?

"I wanted to be a superhero when I was a child."
Suddenly.
That man, himself a superhero in my child's eyes, said that as if yearning for it.

"What? What do you mean by 'wanted'? Did you give up?"
I became angry and asked him.
Kiritsugu laughed apologetically and looked up at the sky.

"Yes, unfortunately. Being a hero is a time-limited thing, and it becomes hard to call yourself that when you grow up. I wish I'd found that out earlier."
I agreed with that.
I didn't know why, but I thought it couldn't be wrong if Kiritsugu said it.

"I see. Then I guess it couldn't be helped."
"Yeah. It really couldn't be helped."
Kiritsugu answers.
So of course, my response was determined.

"Yeah, it can't be helped, so I'll take your place.
 It's impossible since you're an adult, but it should be all right for me. Let me take on your dream."

"I'll make it come true."

Before I could finish, my father laughed.
He made a face like he didn't even need to hear the rest.
After breathing in, Emiya Kiritsugu said...
"YeahI'm relieved."
He quietly closed his eyes and ended his life.

I did not cry because he looked so calm, as if he would wake up the next morning.
It must also have to do with the fact that I'm used to seeing death.
I just silently looked up at the winter moon and my sleeping father.

There were no sounds of insects in the garden. All was silent.
In the bright night, I remember only my eyes burning.
I did not cry out, nor did I feel sad.
But I could not stop my tears until the moon sank.

That is the story from a winter five years ago.
Perhaps I cried ten years worth of tears, since after that, there was nothing.

Fuji-Nee's father planned the funeral, and I started living in this house by myself.
Even though Kiritsugu was gone, nothing changed.
Emiya Shirou would become a superhero like Emiya Kiritsugu, so there was no time to be playing around.

Yes.
I never said it, but I clearly remember it.
The figure of the man who saved a lone boy from an inferno.
Emiya Kiritsugu held up the dying child and said "thank you".

Since then, he was the subject of my admiration.
No one saved me.
I couldn't save anyone.
In it all, I was saved, and a person was there to save me.
That's why I decided to become like him.

Become a superhero, so that I could save people and let no one be killed... just like him.
Kiritsugu died peacefully, leaving me his dream of becoming a superhero himself.

It's only natural for a child to succeed his father.
Emiya Shirou must become a superhero and save someone just like the old me.

I swore that oath as a child.
To fulfill the dream of the man I admired most.

...But honestly, I don't get it.
What this superhero thing is supposed to be, how to become one, how to make everyone happy like Kiritsugu always said... and I became this thing called a Master and things like the blond-haired girl following me around is confusing my head and really

"......!"
When I open my eyes, I'm in a familiar room.
"What, I'm in my own room?"
As soon as I speak, I start to feel terribly sick.
"...Ugh... it tastes bad... in my mouth..."
I taste blood.
Maybe it was filling my mouth, but I breathe in thick air.


I'm not sure why I feel like this.
I feel really sick to my stomach, so I want to go to the bathroom and wash my face.

"All right."
I get up.
I feel dizzy.
I almost fall and support myself by putting a hand against the wall.
"...Ugh."
The nausea increases when I move.
...No, this is more like pain than nausea.

My body is heavy and it feels like my stomach is turning every time I move. Maybe someone would feel like this if they had burning lead poured into their stomach.
"...Ugh... Imagining that gives me a headache."
I wipe the sweat off my forehead and wobble out of my room.

"...All right. I feel better now."
I wash my face and wipe the sweat off my body.
"...?"
There are bandages wrapped around my stomach for some reason.
I can't recall anything about them, so I leave them be for now.

"...I'm hungry. I wonder if there are any leftovers..."
Even though my stomach feels terrible, it seems my body wants energy.

"Guh..."
Putting my mind into it, I start to walk along the wall.
I still feel dizzy, and my body feels dull.
"OwOwww"
I walk forward, crying out miserably.
...Really, what did I do before going to bed?
I don't remember any training that could have caused this pain.

I reach the living room.
Sakura and Fuji-Nee must be at school.
There's no breakfast prepared in the living room, and there's none of Fuji-Nee's loudness.
The living room is quiet, like an ordinary Sunday
"Good morning. I'm afraid I came in without asking you, Emiya-kun."
No, it's not.

"Wha!?"
Tohsaka Rin is sitting on a cushion.
Her calmness makes me think I'm the guest in this house and not her.
Yeah, that's why I'm even more surprised.

"......"
I don't know how to answer her, so I sit down.
And then, I take a deep breath and ask, 
"Tohsaka, why..."
"Hold on. Could you apologize first? I can't calm down until I hear an apology for last night."
I don't even have time to ask her why she's here.

Tohsaka is glaring at me like she's really mad.
It seems she's really angry about last night, but what happened?

"Hold on."
I recall it now.
That's right, why am I so relaxed?
I tried to save Saber and... Berserker blew away my stomach.

"...Ugh."
The nausea returns.
I feel a chill, remembering the feeling of having a hole in my body.
Something in my stomach moves.
It makes me feel sick.
It makes me feel sick, but that proves I'm still alive.

Wait, that's weird.
Shouldn't that have been instant death for me?

"That's strange. Why the hell am I alive?"
"Do you remember? The stupid thing you did last night? If you do, then please reflect upon your actions."

Tohsaka lets out a "hmph" as she scolds me.
...Huh, that's really annoying.
My head, which was frozen by the fact that Tohsaka is here, finally resumes activity again.

"What are you saying? There was nothing else to do at the time! Oh... well, it does look stupid if you just look at the results, but I was going to do it better.
 So it wasn't a mistake."
I protest, glaring at her.

"...Hmph."
W-What?
Why is she sighing?

"Didn't I tell you Servants disappear if their Master is killed? It's crazy to try to protect your Servant."

"Look, Saber will disappear if you're killed. If you want to save Saber, think of a way to do so from a safe place.
 ...Geez, don't you understand that protecting your Servant with your life is just meaningless?"

"It's not that I protected her with my life. I tried to save her, and it just happened to work out like that. I didn't think things would end up like that either."
I did think I would be killed if I went near that monster, but that's a different matter.

"...I see. You seem to be misunderstanding."
As if she's read my mind, she sulks even more.

"Look, Emiya-kun. I'll come out and say it.  I didn't take you to the church to help you win.
 I was trying to help you stay alive even if you were left on your own. It seems you didn't understand that part of it."

"Help me stay alive...?"
"That's right. You shouldn't take risks if you realize that a loss equals your death. You seem to be someone who would walk out at night by yourself even in a situation like this. 
 If I threatened you, I thought you wouldn't take risks and you might get through this."

"I see. I didn't notice that."
So that's why she's complaining to me about not realizing that and running at Berserker.

"...? So why are you mad, Tohsaka? It shouldn't bother you if I'm the one that made the mistake."

"Of course it bothers me! You made me worry for a whole night!"

Tohsaka loses her temper.
...But I see.
Honestly, I'm happy she's worrying about me.
Looking at the situation, it seems Tohsaka was the one who treated my injuries.

"I see. I guess you helped me out. Thank you."
I bow my head to show my thanks and apologize.


"Heh, if you undersand, then we'll let it slide. If you've learned from this, then think before acting next time."

Tohsaka looks away.
Her gesture is snappy, but it seems she's in a good mood again.

"Then we're done with what happened last night.
 I'll move on to the main topic, but which do you want to talk about? Last night or something serious?"

"...?"
Tohsaka starts a conversation as if it's natural to do so.
Her straight-forwardness surprises me, but thinking about it, she came here for a reason.

If she didn't have business with me, she would have gone home already.
What is it that Tohsaka, my enemy, wants to discuss in her enemy's territory?

I'm interested in that, and I also want to know what happened last night.
It's stupid not to ask, so I

"I want to know what happened yesterday first."
"That's right. Knowing the current situation comes first. Wow, you're pretty smart."
Smiling in satisfaction, Tohsaka describes yesterday's events.

It seems that Berserker left after I lost consciousness.
She tells me that my body started to heal itself, and that it looked fine after about ten minutes.
And she says she brought me here since I didn't regain consciousness even after my wound healed, and that's where we are right now.

"The important thing is you survived on your own. I did help, but it was your own power that healed you. Don't mistake that part."
"It seems that way from what you told me. So you didn't heal it?"

"Of course not. I can't do anything like revive a dying person any more. Emiya Shirou himself healed his own wounds."

"Hm."
What can I do, now that she said that?
My stomach is certainly healed, but I have doubts about Tohsaka's story.
I can't use healing magic, let alone revival magic.

"Then the cause must be the Servant.
 Your Servant must be really powerful, or something went wrong during the summoning. ...Well, I think it's both, but I think some kind of line formed between you two."

"A line? You mean like the karmic line connecting a familiar and a magus?"

"Oh, so you have a working knowledge of familiars?
 Then this should be easy to explain. In other words, Emiya-kun and Saber's relationship is not a normal relationship like the one between a normal master and their familiar.

"It looks like Saber has natural healing powers, so some of that may be flowing into you.
 Normally, the magus's power flows into the familiar, but in your case, the familiar's power is flowing into you and helping you out."

"...Hmmm. So putting it simply, it's like a river flowing upstream?"
"That's a good way to put it. It is not naturally possible, but I bet Saber's magical energy is so great that it can even change the flow of a river. That's the only reason she is able to go against Berserker with her small size."

"Not naturally possible... then is the relationship between you and Archer that of a normal magus and familiar?"
"Yes. He doesn't listen to much of what I say, but we do still have such a relationship."

"The connection between a Servant and a Master is like that of gasoline and an engine. We provide the magical energy, and the Servant uses it.
 ......Well, I guess there have been some Masters who shared their physical bodies with their Servants to obtain false immortality. Not dying until their Servants are dead, something like that... hey, are you listening, Emiya-kun?"

"Huh...? Yeah, I'm listening.
 Then, are you saying most wounds on my body will heal even if I don't do anything?"

"Using your Servant's magical energy. I don't know how, but I'm sure the cause is in Saber's materialization. I know you haven't learned the curse of self-healing."
"Of course not. My father never taught me anything that difficult."

"No, I mean that if that's the case, I've nothing to worry about. Don't worry about it, it has nothing to do with you."

"...?"
What is it?
Tohsaka's words are indirect and hard to follow.

"Oh well. Just don't do anything too reckless.
 It's good that you survived this time, but you won't survive if you get hurt like that again. You shouldn't get optimistic and think that you'll survive any major injury."

"I understand. I feel bad about getting hurt and having Saber helping me."

"Idiot, that's not the reason. I'm sure you're not just using Saber's magical energy to heal your wounds.
 You're definitely using something.
 I don't know what it is... your life span, your luck, or your savings account, but you're definitely using something up."
Tohsaka gives a "hmph" once again.
I feel the same way, but...

"Tohsaka, isn't my savings account completely unrelated?"
"Of course it's related! Magic uses up your money, so it's something that drains your money the more you use it!
 I won't allow myself to be wrong!"
Tohsaka Rin erupts with the fire of a personal grudge.

It's strange.
The more I talk with her, the more I understand this is the real Tohsaka Rin, and that the Tohsaka at school is just a mask she puts on.
...No, it's something I realized already yesterday.

"Well, putting the part about money aside.
 Is it okay if I ask you a serious question, Emiya-kun?"
"That's why you stayed here, right? All right, I'll listen."

"Then I'll be direct about it. What are you planning to do from now on?"
She confronts me with the one question I don't want to be asked.

...No, that's not it.
It's not that I don't want her to ask me, but I haven't made my mind up yet.
I'm the one who wants to ask what I should do now.

"...Honestly, I don't know. You say I should fight for the Holy Grail, but I've never been in a fight between magi.
 First of all, I"
I want to try to avoid killing people, and most of all

"I'm not interested in something mysterious like the Holy Grail.
 I'm not too sure about risking my life for something I don't want."
"I knew you'd say that. You'll be killed by your Servant with an attitude like that."

"Wha... Why would I!?"
"Because the Servant's goal is also the Holy Grail.
 They can be summoned by the Masters because obtaining the Holy Grail is a condition of their summoning."

"The most important thing for a Servant is to obtain the Holy Grail.
 They obey their Master and risk their life for their Master, because they have a chance of obtaining it.
 So just try saying that you don't want the Holy Grail. You can't complain even if they kill you and call you a traitor."

"...What?  That's weird.  Servants are summoned by the Masters, right?
 So"

"Do you think a Servant would obey a human without being rewarded? 
 The Holy Grail grants the wish of whoever obtains it. The Servant of the Master who obtains it is no exception.
 Even Servants have their own wishes. That is why they respond to the otherwise impossible summoning."

"It's not that Masters summon Servants to obtain the Holy Grail.
 Servants answer the Masters' call so they can obtain it."


Servants have their own desires...?
Then, does that mean Saber has a wish she wants the Holy Grail to grant?

"That's why the Servants try to eliminate other Servants even without orders from their Masters. Only one can obtain the Holy Grail. They cannot accept other Masters obtaining it.
 Unlike their Masters, they don't have the power to take away the Command Spells. So the only way they can disarm other Masters is to kill them."

"So even if the Master has no intention of fighting, battle is inevitable.
 A Master who is attacked by a Servant must fight it off with their own Servant. You heard enough from Kirei to know that this is the nature of the Holy Grail War, right?"

"Yeah, he told me that last night.
 But"

That means allowing your Servant to try to kill other Servants.
I thought it would be over if I reached a compromise with other Masters, but if Servants are summoned to obtain the Holy Grail and they will not give it up, then a battle between the Servants is inevitable.
...Then...
The girl who fought to protect me is also ready to kill or be killed to obtain the Holy Grail?

"...That's awful. I don't know about this heroic spirit thing, but Saber is human. She was bleeding badly yesterday too."
"Oh, don't worry about that. There's no life or death for Servants. Even if Servants are eliminated, they just go back to where they belong. Heroic spirits are a phenomenon, they can't be killed. The only ones that can be killed during a fight are Masters."

"No, but still..."
Even if it's a temporary death...
There's still the fact that something human-like has disappeared from this world.

"What? Are you saying it's murder? Are you still carrying such a sense of justice even though you're a magus?"


Her comment is only natural.
As a magus, death is always right beside me.
I understand it and I'm already prepared for that.
But stillI'm not strong enough to judge people's deaths as good or bad.

"Of course. I won't fight anyone to the death."
"Oh? So you're just going to wait for the others to kill you? You're ceding the victory to other Masters?"

"That's not it. The point is to survive to the end, right? I don't have any intention of killing others, but I'll have no mercy in a fight to protect myself.
 ...If the enemies are out to kill me, they can't complain if they are killed in return, right?"

"Oh, so you'll be staying on the defensive. Then you'll just be observing what other Masters are doing, right? So even if someone like yesterday goes around killing everyone, you're going to ignore it?"

Someone like yesterday...?
She must mean that inhuman monster.

Superhuman strength that allows the destruction of a house or two with a single blow...
...Certainly, if that thing wished it, this town could be in ruins in just one night.

And on top of that, the problem is that the Servants are normally in spirit form.
Humans can't see those in spirit form.
But since the Servants can affect the real world as spirits, you could call them the most powerful weapon.
With the technology we have now, there are no weapons that can affect spiritual beings.

Our attacks are useless against them, while theirs can still harm us.
It's more than just an unfair game.
Murder by a Servant is like natural death for normal people.
Death caused by an invisible killer will just be treated as an accident or suicide.

"What is that? Servantsno, Masters and Servants don't just attack other Masters? Don't other people have nothing to do with them?"
"Yeah, I really wish that was the case. But if it were, you wouldn't need a supervisor like Kirei, would you?"

"I should have said earlier. Servants are spirits. They are already complete, so they don't grow.
 But magical energy used as fuel is different.
 The more they have available, the more they can use the powers they had in life.
 In that respect, they're just like us magi... Do you understand?"

"I do. So they can use magic repeatedly, right?"

You could say magical energy is the gunpowder to fill a gun, and the magus is the gun itself.
The type of gun depends on the abilities of the magus: pistol, rifle, machine gun, shotgun...
Continuing with that metaphor, Servants are cannons.
Using a large amount of gunpowder, they fire a large bullet.

"That's right. Servants aren't given their mana by nature. They act with the magical energy inside them.
 We Masters support them, so Servants can only use their powers using their own magical energy plus the magical energy of their Masters.

"But that means an amateur Master like you would be no match for other Masters, right?
 So there's a loophole... well, I guess you could call it an obvious answer. Servants can supplement their magical energy from other sources.
 Servants are spirits, so they can get nourishment from eating things that are like them."

"Hm?"
Nourished by eating things that are like them...?
"Things like them? You mean other spirits? But what kind of spirits would they eat?"

"It's a simple answer. Nature spirits obtain power from nature itself.
So where do you think Servants, human spirits, get their power from?"
"Oh."
It is a simple answer.
Just as we humans eat meat, the human spirits

"Exactly. Usually, they replenish enough magical energy from their Masters.
 But it's obvious that one gets more magical energy from many people than from just one person, right?
 So, to put it bluntly, a weak Master makes his Servant eat humans."


"Servants transform human emotions and souls into magical energy.
 That is the most efficient way to make your Servant more powerful. There are many Masters who kill humans as sacrifices for their Servants."

"As sacrifices... so you're saying that if a Master didn't care about his methods, he would kill humans to make his Servant stronger?"
"Yes. But I don't think a smart Master would do such a thing."

"You see, even if Servants are powerful, there is a limit to their magical energy capacity. They can't store magical energy beyond it, so there is a limit to how much they can kill to collect magical energy. 
 The Association wouldn't ignore you if you went around killing people, and most of all, other Masters might figure out your Servant's abilities and identify them from the cause of death. Not to mention the identity of the Master as well.
 It is highly advantageous in the Holy Grail War to keep your identity a secret, so most Masters should use their Servants sparingly."

...I see.
Certainly, if nobody knows that you are a Master, there's no danger of other Masters attacking you.
Conversely, if you know who the other Masters are, you could definitely pull a surprise attack on them.
By that theory, there won't be many Masters that would have their Servants attack humans and reveal their identity

"...I'm glad. Then there's no problem. That means Servants won't indiscriminately attack humans without orders from their Master."

"Right. They are heroes, right? Someone who would go out and kill people wouldn't be called a hero in the first placewell, no, I can't really say that for sure.
 There are many examples of people becoming heroes just because they were mass murderers."


Tohsaka makes an ominous comment.
As it seems to be her true feelings rather than just sarcasm, a bit of strain in her personality might be showing.

"Let's get back to the point. What are you going to do?
 Since you don't want to kill people, you're just going to watch, is that right?"

...I take back what I said.
She really has a bad personality. She's a real bully, putting me on the spot and asking me that with a smile.

"I'll just have to stop them. The Masters will calm down once they lose their Servants, right?"
"Unbelievable. You say you won't go out and kill other Masters, but you also say you'll kill them if they do anything bad.
 Emiya-kun, do you realize you're contradicting yourself?"

"Yeah, I know it's selfish, but I can't think of any other choices. I won't change my decision no matter how much you argue against it."

"Hmm. But there's one problem with that. Would you like to know what it is?"
She's plotting something. With that face, she's definitely plotting something.
But as a man, I have to listen.

"O-Okay. What is it?"
"Do you remember the Master yesterday? The girl who was talking about killing you and me?"

How could I forget?  They attacked us mercilessly.

"That girl will come to kill us. I think you know that too."

I... see.
That girl is a Master too.

Since she knows Tohsaka and I are Masters, she will come and attack us sooner or later.
I don't know if it'll be today or tomorrow, but I do know it's a death sentence.
At least, I know I can't stop such a monster.

"Her Servant, Berserker, is on a different level.
 You can't match it, being an inexperienced Master. You say you won't do anything except defend yourself, but you won't even be able to do that."

"Sorry. But you wouldn't be able to beat it either, right?"

"I wouldn't be able to beat it head on. It's the most powerful Servant in hand-to-hand combat. I don't think any previous Servant could match it. Even I wouldn't be able to escape if Berserker attacked me."

"...I feel the same way. I don't think I'll get another chance if they attack me again."

Unconsciously, I place my hand on my stomach.
The wound on my stomach is healed now.
No, you couldn't call it a wound. It was pretty much instant death.
My nausea returns just at the thought of taking another blow like that.

"That's right. Do you get it? You can't choose to wait until the Holy Grail War is over without doing anything."

"...Yeah, I get it. But what are you trying to say? I don't quite understand.
 Or are you enjoying watching me be condemned to death?"

"I don't have such bad taste.
 Geez, don't you get it after I've said so much? In short, I'm asking you if you want to join up with me."

"...?"
Hm? Hmmmm, hm?
Um, if I take that at face value, that's...

"Join up!? You mean, me and you!?"
"Yes. My Archer received a fatal wound and is healing right now. It will take a while for him to heal fully, but he should still be about half as useful.
 And there are no problems with your Servant, but her Master is dragging her down, so she is half as useful as well. See, it adds up fine."

"Huh. I'm not that bad."
"Even though you've almost died three times from what I know of? I think you're the first person I've ever seen almost die three times in one day."

"Guhbut that's..."
"I'll make the alliance worthwhile. I'll forgive you for beating Archer and I'll teach you about being a Master. Oh, and if we have time, I can look at your skills as a magus. How about it?"

...Ugh.
That certainly is an attractive proposal.
As I don't know anything, Tohsaka would be a useful teacher.

And if I can help it, I don't want to fight against her.
Not because she's the girl I admired at school.
In fact, if I didn't know her like this, I wouldn't feel this much resistance.

...The Tohsaka Rin in front of me is so different from how people describe her as an honor student.
But talking to her, she is just Tohsaka and it seems she's just as she appears.
Wellin other words, I'm saying I find her so much more attractive this way that I'm wondering why I even have to tell myself this

"Emiya-kun? I want to hear your answer."
She urges me to respond.
I

I go up the stairs.
Leaving Saber to watch the house, I end up at school, but I'm still a little gloomy.

"...Emiya-kun!?"
"Oh."
She's here.
The one person I can discuss anything with appears out of nowhere. It's almost too good to be true.

"I see.
 You must think I'm soft."
She must have something to tell me as well, since she stops and talks to me.

How fortunate for me!
I'll
"Fine. If that's how you want it, we'll settle things here and now. I can't believe you came to school without your Servant"
"Sorry! I'm begging you! Please let me talk to you!"
I close in on Tohsaka and push her against the wall.
I can't let the other students hear this.

"H-Hey, what are you thinking...!? I didn't mean that, and there are people here...!"

"Please, you're the only one I can depend on. Sakura might get involved in the Holy Grail War, and I don't know what to do. You know a lot, so tell me, is there a way to protect Sakura without telling her anything!?"


Tohsaka stares at me in complete surprise.
"Oh... I-I'm sorry. I got flustered because the timing of you being here was perfect.
 ...Um, Sakura is my underclassman. She might get involved in the Holy Grail War, and I don't want that. But I can't come up with any good ideas, so..."

"I don't care about your excuses. Can you just let go of me?
 Homeroom is going to start."
"...! O-Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't notice...!"

I quickly let go of Tohsaka.
...I feel my face burning.
What was I thinking, pushing Tohsaka up against the wall like that...!?

"I'm sorry. I know I'm apologizing a lot, but please hear me out. I"
"...You want to ask me something, right? All right, I'll listen."
"What? R-Really!?"

"...Hey now. You look like you're going to die if I don't listen to you. Come up to the rooftop during lunchtime. I'll listen then."
Tohsaka turns and goes up the stairs.

As I look up at her in blank amazement...
"You idiot. You'll be late if you don't hurry."
...Tohsaka leaves with those words.
Tohsaka is the only one I can consult with about Shinji.
No, the real problem is the bruise Sakura had this morning, but that problem involves Shinji as well

"Fine. If that's how you want it, we'll settle things here and now. I can't believe you came to school without your Servant"
"Sorry! I'm begging you! Please let me talk to you!"

I close in on Tohsaka and push her against the wall.
I can't let the other students hear this.

"H-Hey, what are you thinking...!? I didn't mean that, and there are people here...!"

"Please, you're the only one I can depend on. Sakura might get involved in the Holy Grail War, and I don't know what to do. You know a lot, so tell me, is there a way to protect her without telling her anything!?"


Tohsaka stares at me in complete surprise.
"Oh... I-I'm sorry. I got flustered because the timing of you being here was perfect.
 ...Um, Sakura is my underclassman. She might get involved in the Holy Grail War, and I don't want that. But I can't come up with any good ideas, so..."

"I don't care about your excuses. Can you just let go of me?
 Homeroom is going to start."
"...! O-Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't notice...!"

I quickly let go of Tohsaka.
...My face starts turning red.
What was I thinking, pushing Tohsaka up against the wall like that...!?

"I'm sorry. I know I'm apologizing a lot, but please hear me out. I"
"...You want to ask me something, right? All right, I'll listen."
"What? R-Really!?"
"...Hey now. You look like you're going to die if I don't listen to you. Come up to the rooftop during lunchtime. I'll listen then."
Tohsaka turns and goes up the stairs.

As I look up at her in blank amazement...
"You idiot. You'll be late if you don't hurry."
...Tohsaka leaves with those words.
I'll run away.
I mean, I should hurry to my classroom.
Consulting Tohsaka seemed like a good idea, but...

The school's number one honor student exudes the aura of a cat about to pounce on her prey and tear it apart.
Discretion is the better part of valor.

"Good morning, Tohsaka. Goodbye, Tohsaka."
I sprint up the stairs.

"H-Hold on, I'm not done yet...!"
I ignore her and run into the hallway.
...I think I'm making things worse, but there's nothing more dangerous than talking to her right now.

I made it.
It's three minutes before homeroom starts, and Fuji-Nee isn't here yet.

Shinji's desk is empty.
It'd hard to face him after what happened yesterday, but I wanted to settle things.
But I can't do anything if he's not here.
Going to Shinji's house will only provoke him, so I have to come up with a way that won't involve Sakura.

"...Huh?"
There's another empty desk.
That's Issei's desk.
"That's rare. So even Issei can be absent, huh?"
I set my bag down and prepare for homeroom.

"Sorry to keep you all waiting! Isn't this a new record!?"
Fuji-Nee arriving before the bell rings is a rare spectacle indeed.

...I'm relieved.
I thought she slept in since she didn't come to my house this morning, but she's more energetic than usual.

"It's lunchtime! Let's go eat some meat at the cafeteria!"
Someone screams in joy the moment the lunch bell rings.
Only the guys would say something like that, and the girls move their desks to the corner as if to distance themselves.

"Oh, I'm eating at the cafeteria today too. I'll go with you, Saitama."
"I'll pass. I ate some meat yesterday."
"We'll pass as well... Please give it up already, guys. We're tired of the food there."

"What!? The B meal at our cafeteria is the best! The croquette tastes just like meat!"
"Well, that might be enough for you, but I don't like how the vegetables taste like meat as well."

"What about you, Emiya? The amount of people who go to the cafeteria depends on if you brought your lunch or not. Make some lunch for me sometime, will you?"
"Hey, that's no fair! Come over here, Emiya-kun. Let's trade your stuff for our sandwiches."

"Come on, you only got that at the convenience store! You're a girl and you didn't put effort into cooking!? You don't deserve our lunches! You have to make omelets if you want some of our good food!"
"Hey, that's rude! I can make an omelet. You just pour water on it and heat it up. Isn't that right, Emiya-kun?"

"......No, that's wrong.
 You guys have it all wrong. And I didn't bring my lunch today. I won't have time to make lunch, so I'll be eating at the cafeteria until finals."

Whaaaaaaaat!!?

The people that didn't bring their lunch all pout in unison.
My classmates are in harmony only at times like these.

The guys come back, arguing if fried shrimp that tastes like meat is a good thing or a bad thing.

It's almost fifth period. I should sit down and get ready

"...What is this?"
I find a strange piece of paper in my desk.


...I'm at a loss for words.
She must have disguised her handwriting, just in case.

"Tohsaka."
...It has to be her.
She's the only one that would know about "this morning".
"......"
I want to pretend I didn't see this letter, but the last line really catches my attention.

"...She must know I can see the words she scribbled out... Or maybe not."
...I really don't want to, but it's great to have a chance to talk to her.
I don't know what to do about Sakura, so I'll consult Tohsaka about it

With the end of sixth period, school is over.
It's time.
I don't know what Tohsaka intends to do, but there are students staying in the building.
The archery club should be practicing until five, so I can take cover there if something happens.
Tohsaka is a legitimate magus, so she shouldn't attack me in front of people.

Miyama City is located in a valley between mountains.
There are hills all over town, and there are roads that lead up to small mountains.

And this school is on one of them.
The back of the school isn't landscaped at all.
Instead, it is woodland that stretches across the back of the school.

So.
In this place, where even the athletic clubs never enter...
...A furious demon awaits me.

"......"
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I ought to go home.
But I'll be killed for sure if I turn my back to her.
I bet she'll mercilessly shower me with her magic.

"Um, I'm here, Tohsaka. What's up?"
I call out to her from the edge of the woods.
I really can't go in any further.
There would be less chance of survival if I did go into the woods.

"Hey, Tohsaka! Do you not hear me!?"
I yell out to her.
My voice echoes through the woods.

"I hear you! Don't shout

 my name so loudly!!"
Her voice comes ringing back.
She yells at me after she rushes in at me.
Her voice echoes even longer than mine.

"...Wow, that's amazing, Tohsaka. I bet they heard you in the archery range."
"Oh... Crap, you got me carried away again."
Gritting her teeth, Tohsaka backs up a step.

"Heh. It's fine, this is expected. I knew you would show up defenseless."
So...
I don't know what the deal is, but she seems to be getting angrier as we talk.

"...? What are you so mad about? Was it that embarrassing to scream out like that?"
"I-I wouldn't get mad about something as trivial as that.
 What's irritating me is your harmfulness that's taken as harmless."

She glares at me.
I guess I should be nervous about being alone with her, but because of where we are, I don't panic.

"...? What do you mean by that? Are you saying I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing?"
"That's just imitation. You may be a sheep, but you are so mutated you could kill a wolf."

"...???"
I'm even more confused.
Actually... isn't a mutated sheep not a sheep anymore?

"Oh well. We don't have time to waste on chatter.  Let's get to the point. I'm glad you didn't run away, Emiya-kun."
"Of course not. I can't ignore such threats. Those words themselves even felt cursed."

"Huh?"
Then...
Tohsaka freezes once again.

"Wait, what do you mean by threats?"
"It's this."
I show her the piece of paper that was in my desk.

"Geez, don't scare me like that. I thought someone other than me lured you out here."

"You're really hasty. It's true that I was irritated, but I won't curse a memo. That's just a normal message
 ...Hey, why are you frowning like that?"

"......"
My expression is only natural.
Tohsaka honestly thinks that it's an ordinary memo.
Well, it doesn't really matter what she thinks of it, but the image in my head of Tohsaka Rin crumbles to dust.

"...Uh... Could it be that I unconsciously cursed it with my Gandr...?"
"Huh? No, the letter itself was normal. But this is a threat, no matter how you look at it.  Any other student would've told the teacher right away."

"I-I couldn't help it. I didn't have time, and it's not like I could write you a formal letter. So that's all I could do."

"Okay. ...But you didn't have to change your handwriting. And the last line was really scary."

"That's your fault as well.
 You ran away this morning, so I thought I had to write something extra to make you come here. I was being considerate when I put some emotion into it."

"Heh, fine. I don't care if you think it's a threat.  You're here, and that's what matters."

She looks away angrily.
...Well, I'm glad Tohsaka knew that the memo sounded like a threat.

"Fine. So, what do you want, Tohsaka? Calling me out to a place like this... do you want to fight me?"

"If you want. But don't get me wrong. I'm not attacking you because Archer is healing his wounds. I would've taken your Command Spell this morning if he wasn't wounded.
 ...I really wanted to when I saw you walking around this morning, after I've told you so many times not to act carelessly."


I'm stunned.
So, Tohsaka is angry about...
"...? So you were worried about me, Tohsaka?"
...I don't know why, but is that the case?

"T-That's not true! I wanted to talk to you because I was concerned about what happened this morning.
 You were about to say something, right? I was worried, so I decided to hear you out."



I'm even more surprised.
I never thought Tohsaka would insist that I consult her.

"Why are you so quiet? ...It's all right, I won't force it out of you if you don't want to talk about it. I'm not angry now, so I'll go home if you have nothing to say."

"Ohhold on, Tohsaka.
 I do have something I want to ask you. No, I really do need to consult you."

"Then tell me. I can keep any secret, and I'll help you if I can."

"Yeah, thanks.
 ...Um, this has nothing to do with you, but there's this girl called Matou Sakura.
 She's a year below me, and I've known her for a long time. Her older brother is Matou Shinji, and I've known him for a long time as well.
 To put it simply, I fought a Master last night, and that Master was Shinji."

"...Matou Shinji was a Master...?"
"Yeah. I'm sure of it because his grandfather, Matou Zouken, told us. I heard that the Matou family is a family of magidid you know about that, Tohsaka?"

"Of course. The only magus in this town that I didn't know about is you. But I never thought it was possible. Because Shinji is..."

"He's not a magus. He doesn't have a Magic Circuit, right? That's what Matou Zouken said.
 ...But that's a condition to be a magus.
 I think the conditions for becoming a Master are different. I'm like Shinji. You shouldn't assume that only magi can become Masters."

"......I see. So, what about Shinji? Did you defeat him?"
"Yeah. Saber defeated his Servant, Rider. His book, his Command Spell, burned up, so he isn't a Master anymore.
 ...But I don't think he's given up. That alone is dangerous, but on top of that, Sakura has to live with him."

"I heard from Zouken that magic only gets taught to the successor. Sakura was raised without being taught anything, so she doesn't know what Shinji is doing.
 As long as she doesn't find out, she won't get involved in this war between the Masters."

"......You're right. So why do you think Sakura is in danger?"
"I told you that Shinji is dangerous right now. He might take out his anger on Sakura, and who knows what'll happen if he does something even worse.
 So, um..."

"So you want to end it before Shinji involves Sakura? Your idea is good, but it's not possible. Just look at the Ryudou Temple. The other Masters are tricky. I think this Holy Grail War will last longer than expected."


...I see.
The best outcome would be for Shinji to give up, but that's not realistic.
The only option is to separate Sakura from Shinji

"Then there's only one possible solution. If you don't want to involve Sakura, you have to put her under your protection."
"I thought about that, but I'm a Master too.
 It's too dangerous to have her at my place, and Shinji will never stand for it.  Besides, I doubt she wants to stay at my house."

"...Geez. You really are dense, Emiya-kun."
"Huh?"

"Never mind. Just go ahead and ask her. Protecting Sakura from Shinji and protecting her from other Masters are one and the same.
 Shouldn't you choose the option that lets you do something? ...Um, if this Sakura person is someone important to you."


Tohsaka's words hit me hard.
It feels like she smacked me upside the head.
"You're right. You're absolutely right. I should ask her before I start worrying about what I think."
"......"

"Thanks, Tohsaka. I'll try to convince Sakura once I get home... Hey, why are you quiet all of a sudden?"

"Nothing. I'm quiet because this is nothing you have to thank me for.
 But I owe you one now. I didn't think you'd tell me that Shinji was a Master.
 I guess I have to show you one of my cards as well."

"What? One of your cards...?"
"I have to give you information. The information that Shinji was a Master helps me out, so I'll give you some information I have as well.
 You know about the people who have gone into comas around town, right?
 That's a Servant's doing, and the Master is at the Ryudou Temple."

"...!? Oh, you were saying something about the Ryudou Temple earlier. ...Wait, that Ryudou Temple?"

"Yes. They're cunning enemies, so watch out if you're planning on attacking them. They aren't taking lives, but they are attacking indiscriminately.
 Since they're getting stronger by the day, I want to beat them as soon as possible, but the wound Archer suffered hasn't healed yet.
 Well, I'm going to sit and watch for a while since they can only use a set amount of magical energy at once, no matter how much magical energy they may store."


...A Master is at the Ryudou Temple.
Tohsaka is doing her best as a Master, even though her Servant isn't fully healed yet.

"That's all.
 Goodbye, Emiya-kun. You should go home quickly and comfort your precious underclassman."

"Hey, Tohsaka...!"
I stop Tohsaka, but she ignores me and walks to the archery range.

"...?"
...What was that?
Tohsaka was in a bad mood all this time, but something was different at the end there.

"Oh, it's time to leave... I certainly should go home quickly."
I hear the five o'clock bell.
The sun will set soon.
I need to get home and deal with the Sakura issue.
I hurry to my classroom.
It's three minutes before homeroom starts, and Fuji-Nee isn't here yet.
Shinji's desk is empty.
It'd hard to face him after what happened yesterday, but I wanted to settle things.
But I can't do anything if he's absent.
Going to Shinji's house will only provoke him, so I have to come up with a way that won't involve Sakura.

"...Huh?"
There's another empty desk.
That's Issei's desk.
"That's rare. So even Issei can be absent, huh?"
I set my bag down and prepare for homeroom.

"Sorry to keep you all waiting! Isn't this a new record!?"
Fuji-Nee arriving before the bell rings is a rare spectacle indeed.
Heh.
I thought she'd slept in since she didn't come to my house this morning, but she's even more energetic than usual.

The lunchtime bell rings.
I sprint out of the classroom, buy some bread and tea, and hurry up the stairs.

"Haa, haa, ha!"
I dash to the rooftop, startling students as I go.
My heart's beating fast.
It's been pounding faster and faster the whole day.

"...Haa, haa, ah"
To be honest, I'm nervous.
I'm glad that I can consult her, but that hardly seems to matter now.

I must've been crazy to make arrangements with Tohsaka Rin.
She's the school idol, the perfect honor student, the girl I've admired!

"Man, calm down, you idiot!"
I try to catch my breath as I run up the stairs.

...Anyway, this is a big event.
Tohsaka is Tohsaka even though she's a Master, so I can't be late.
And I'm asking her a favor.
So I have to get there before her and act cool.

But...
"T-Tohsaka?"
"You're late, Emiya-kun."
...It seems there's a line no ordinary person can cross.

"You want to talk to me about something, right? Let's sit down."
Without waiting for a reply, Tohsaka walks over to the water tower.
I see.
Nobody will see us there, and it'll block the wind.

"So, tell me what's on your mind. Who's this Sakura girl, and what happened yesterday?"
"Eho-okay. It's a bit long, but do you mind?"
"Try to make it short. Lunchtime isn't that long."

...!
Having her this close is just making me more nervous.
But now's not the time.
I have to ask her about Sakura.

"T-Then I'll try to make this simple.
 Matou Sakura is my underclassman, and I've known her for a long time.
 Her older brother is Matou Shinji, and I've known him for a long time as well.
 To put it simply, I fought a Master last night, and that Master was Shinji."
"...!? Matou Shinji was a Master!?"

"Yeah. I'm sure of it because his grandfather, Matou Zouken, told us. He also said that the Matou family is a family of magidid you know about that, Tohsaka?"

"Of course. The only magus in this town that I didn't know about was you. But I never thought it was possible. Because Shinji is..."

"He's not a magus. He doesn't have a Magic Circuit, right? That's what Matou Zouken said.
 ...But that's a condition to be a magus.
 I think the conditions for becoming a Master are different. I'm like Shinji in that respect. You shouldn't assume that only magi can become Masters."

"......I see. So, what about Shinji? Did you defeat him?"
"Yeah. Saber defeated his Servant, Rider. His book, his Command Spell, burned up, so he isn't a Master anymore.
 ...But I don't think he's given up. That alone is dangerous, but on top of that, Sakura is living at his house."

"I heard from Zouken that magic only gets taught to the successor. Sakura was raised without being taught anything, so she doesn't know what Shinji is doing.
 As long as she doesn't find out, she won't get involved in this war between the Masters."

"......You're right. So why do you think Sakura is in danger?"

"I told you that Shinji is dangerous right now. He might take out his anger on Sakura, and there's no telling what'll happen if he does something even worse.
 So, um..."

"So you want to end it before Shinji involves Sakura? Your idea is good, but it's not possible. Just look at the Ryudou Temple. The other Masters are tricky. I think this Holy Grail War will last longer than expected."


...I see.

"...Geez. You really are dense, Emiya-kun."
"Huh?"

"It's nothing. Just go ahead and ask her. Protecting Sakura from Shinji and protecting her from other Masters are the same thing.
 Shouldn't you choose the option that lets you do something? ...Um, if this Sakura person is someone important to you."


Tohsaka's words hit me hard.
It feels like she smacked me in the head.
"You're right. You're absolutely right. I should ask her before I start worrying about what I think."

"That's right. First of all, nobody would go make meals for a person they hated. Sakura trusts you, so have a little confidence in yourself."

"...? Did I tell you that Sakura comes over to make meals for us?"

"...! Y-You did! You told me at the very beginning! You told me, you probably told me, you certainly told me! You told me, so don't worry about it!"
Her quick shout stops my rebuttal.

"......"
Oh well.
I've already learned that Tohsaka wears a mask at school.

"All right. Thanks, you really helped me out.
 I would've taken longer to make up my mind."

"Oh. You're pretty bold now. Are you showing off, telling me that you would've arrived at the same conclusion by yourself?"
Tohsaka smiles.


Her smile attacks me by surprise.
"Oh, that's not what I meant. But wouldn't you have Sakura stay over if she was still depressed tomorrow?"

"Oh, your face is all red. So you really can't lie, huh? You're acting cool, but you're actually innocent inside."

"...! Who are you to say that!? Is it fun to make fun of people when you're supposed to be an honor student!?"
"Hey now, I choose who I make fun of. I only make fun of people if it's worth doing."

"Come on. It's cold, so come closer and block the wind."
"...!!!!! Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-You idiot, it'll be terrible if we get any closer!! I'll take you on if you're picking a fight with me, so get away from me, you devil!!!"
I arc back and get my face away from Tohsaka.

!!
T-This is bad.
Having her close was bad enough, but just now was fatal.
After getting to know Tohsaka, the person I admired became a dangerous associate.

...That's fine by itself, but that was too much.
When she gets this close to me, I can't ignore her beautiful hair, her soft-looking body, her pretty face...

My heart's pounding so hard that it feels like it's about to explode.
...I hate to admit it, but she is beautiful.
Her true nature is different than what I thought, but I still admire her.

"A-Anyway, thanks for your help. That's all I have to say.
 I'll listen to you now."
"What? I don't have anything to talk about."
"Huh? Weren't you saying something this morning?
 ...Well, I wasn't listening because I was in a panic, but you looked like you were in a bad mood."

"Oh, that. It's fine now. It's true that I had business with you, but I don't feel like it now. I'm surprised, to be honest."
"...??? What do you mean, 'surprised'?"

"I mean that part of you.
 ...Oh well. I'll tell you one good thing while we're at it.
 You know about the people who've been going into comas around town, right?
 That's a Servant's doing, and the Master is at the Ryudou Temple."

"Oh, you were saying something about the Ryudou Temple earlier.
 ...Wait, that Ryudou Temple?"

"Yes. They're cunning enemies, so watch out if you're planning on attacking them. They aren't taking lives, but they are attacking indiscriminately.
 Well, I'm going to sit and watch for a while since they can only use a set amount of magical energy at once, no matter how much magical energy they may store."


...A Master is at the Ryudou Temple.
Tohsaka is doing her best, even though Archer isn't fully healed yet.

"Well, you owe me one, Emiya-kun.
 I told you something you didn't know."
The honor student smiles boldly.
I feel like a frog in front of a snake.

"W-What? I told you about Shinji too. That should make it even."
"Oh, that's been paid for with the advice about Sakura. Or what? You didn't mean those thanks you gave me?"

"Ugh"
S-She's a devil! She's a real devil! Don't let her fool you, everyone! The school's peace is in danger!

"Well, what should I take? Equivalent exchange is standard for magi."
Damn... I think my father said something like that as well.

"Hmmmmmm."
I look down at my hands.
This is the only thing I have right now.

"Do you get it now? You have no information to give me, so tell me Saber's true iden"
"...I guess I can't help it. You haven't eaten yet, right? I'll give you half of this."
I break my bread in half.
...Reluctantly, I give her the whole can of tea as a show of sincerity.

"Heywait, Emiya-kun?"
"Here, eat up. The cafeteria's closed by now. It should fill you up a bit."
I hand her the bread.


Does she not like it? She looks astonished, and...

"Thanks. Then I won't hold myself back."
...And, she really eats the bread without holding back.
School's over, and the commotion is dying down.
The students scatter to go to their clubs or head home.

"...All right. I have to go home and get ready."
Even if Sakura is going to stay over, I need to mentally prepare myself.
I should go buy groceries and wait for her to come after her club activities.

"Well. What should we have for dinner tonight?"
I stand in front of the supermarket and think.
Having Sakura stay over means convincing Fuji-Nee.
Then dinner should be something that they'll both enjoy

"...I already made a huge dinner yesterday. I'm not going to be working for a while and there's one more person to feed, so I shouldn't be spending money..."

But this month is an exception.
I have my savings, and I can't be distracted by money during the Holy Grail War.
And I should be repaying Sakura every chance I get.

"Phew..."
I leave the supermarket with bags full of food.
I think I bought too much, but it's all good.
I got some fresh codfish, so maybe I should make stew tonight.

"All right, anti-Fuji-Nee measure taken care of"
I stop walking.
"...?"
Someone's pulling at my shirt from behind.

"What's going on...?"
Still wondering, I turn around.
There...
...Stands a young girl with silver hair.

"W-What!?"
I quickly jump back.
I tense myself to act, but the girl just stands there and smiles.

"...?"
I don't feel any murderous intent or hostility from her.
"I'm glad you're alive, Onii-chan."
She looks at me with a big smile.

"Wha"
...I'm sure of it. This girl is Berserker's Master.
She controls the monster who nearly killed me.
The girl of the family of magi who started this war, the family which my father betrayed.
Why is she here in the shopping district during daytime?

She doesn't feel like a stranger at all... it must be because the priest's story was so vivid.
That's why...
"Ilya...?"
"Huh?"
...I blurt out her name without knowing what it means.

"Ohsorry, that's wrong...!
 Ilyayeah, it's Ilyasviel...!
 I-I'm sorry for getting it wrong...!"

I quickly apologize.
It doesn't matter if she's Berserker's Master or the daughter of the Einzbern family.
It's just that...
I can't leave her alone when her face looks so sad.

"......"
She's glaring at me, probably because I shortened her name.
"OhI didn't mean to make you mad. I just blurted it out."

"......Tell me your name."
"What?"
"Tell me your name, Onii-chan. It's unfair that I don't know your name."

Oh, she's right.
Ilyasviel told me her name, but I haven't told her mine yet.

"I'm Shirou. Emiya Shirou."
"Emiyashiro? That's a strange name, Onii-chan."
"No. Emiya is my last name, and Shirou is my first name. If it's hard to say it, just call me Shirou."
I correct her pronunciation.


I point right at her nose, and she stands there in surprise.


Even though I regret it, it's too late.
Looking like she's about to cry...

"...Shirou, Shirou, huh? Yeah, I like the name.
 It's simple, but it sounds pretty. It suits you, Shirou.
 I'll forgive you for what you just did!"
...She embraces my arm.

"What!? H-H-Hold on, Ilyasviel! What are you doing...!?"
"No, you can call me Ilya, Shirou! I'm calling you Shirou, so this is fair!"

"Whawell, that's easier to say, but hold on!!!"
I shake my arm, but Ilya only screams happily and enjoys it.

"...!"
This is bad. The neighbors might spread bad rumors about me if I keep this up.

"Damn, what do you want...!? Do you want to fight me right now...!?"
I pull her off by force.

...Oh.
Ilya looks unhappy.

"W-What? Making a face like that won't do you any good. I don't know what your intentions are, but I'm a Master. You can't defeat me that easily"
Groceries in hand, I glare at her.
...But she only looks back at me in wonder.

"......Um, Ilya?"
"Yeah!? What, Shirou!?"
"Ugh."

She isn't like before.
...Well, she was laughing back then too, but her smile is different now. Could it really be?
"...Ilya. You didn't come here to fight...?"
I ask timidly.

"What? Do you want to be killed?"
"!"
Her gaze sends a chill down my spine.
No matter how young this girl may be, she is the strongest Master.
She laughs innocently, but she can also become a ruthless Master.

"...Hmm. I don't get it, but I don't mind you saying so, nor do I mind going ahead with my plans. Do you want to die along with Saber?"
"...Don't kid around. No way! I don't want to die, and I don't want to fight you here."

"Right? Masters can't fight during daytime. You don't have Saber with you, and I don't have Berserker with me."

"...You're right. Then why did you come here? Did we meet up by chance?"
"It's not chance. I snuck out past Sella and specially came to see you. You better feel honored."
She puffs up with pride.


I feel dizzy.
Every time I think she turns into a cruel Master, she returns to being the innocent girl.
I can't tell which is the real her.

"...All right. So you came to see me.
 But you have no intention of fighting me. Am I correct?"
"Yup. I came to talk to you. I've waited all this time, so I can, right?"

I don't know what she means by "all this time", but it seems Ilya just came to talk with me.

"Or do you not want to talk with me? ...I'll go home if you don't want to. I really don't want to go home, but you'll hate me if I make you do something you don't want."
Ilya looks me straight in the eye.

"!"
...As a Master, it's dangerous to spend any time with Ilya. If Saber were here, I bet she wouldn't hesitate to make herself heard.


...But I can't leave her alone when she looks like that.
I know it's reckless, thoughtless, and rash, but...

"I don't mind talking with you. To be honest, I wanted to talk with you."

"All right! Then let's go over that way! I found a small park over there earlier!"
Ilya starts running.

"Come on, come on! I'll leave you behind if you don't hurry!"
She twirls about as she runs.

"Well, I guess it can't be helped."
I accept this turn of events and follow after Ilya.
She called me Shirou.
So I should treat her as a normal girl, and not a Master.

There is no one in the park.
Nobody is playing in the sand pit or on the swings.
It feels desolate, but I sit down on a bench with Ilya.

...This must look weird to other people.
Ilya's a foreigner, so we don't look like siblings, and our ages are too far apart to be friends.

"...So. What do you want to talk about, Ilya? You came to me, so do you have something you want to ask me?"

"Why? I have nothing I want to ask you."

Well.
How should I react to this incomprehensible girl?

"...Ilya. You're the one who wanted to talk.
 So why do you say you have no business with me? You wouldn't have come if you had no business with me, right?"
"O-Oh, really? We can't talk if we don't have business?"

"Uhh... that's not what I meant. Sorry, I put it in the wrong way. We can still talk.  Actually, I guess it's better to talk without purpose.
 ...But, man. I don't know you really well, so I don't know what I should talk about. I don't know what you like, or anything. You don't want me asking you about something you'd rather not talk about, right?"

"Y-You're right... but what should I ask? Will you promise me you won't get mad, whatever I ask you?"
"I'll try. I'm your Onii-chan, so I'll try to act mature."
"I see. Then Shirou, do you like me?"

"WHA!?"
W-W-W-W-W-What the hell is she asking!?

"Oh, you're a liar! You said you won't get mad, but you're mad!"
"Hey, anyone would be shocked by that question! Y-You shouldn't be asking that question when you've already attacked me!"

"Hey, that was different! It's because you jumped out even though you're weak! It's not my fault!"

"It is your fault! You were ready to kill from the beginning! So why are you talking about me liking you and everything!?"
Ilya quivers up and goes quiet.

"...Oh."
...Crap.
I decided that I'd forget about us being Masters, but I guess I didn't.

"...Um, Ilya?"
"......It's important to me. You're an idiot, Shirou!  If I hadn't stopped him you'd be dead right now, but you still want to talk big."
Ilya looks down, trembling.

"......Man."
I guess I have no choice.
I'm the one who started this whole Master conversation, I'm the older one here, and Ilya is a girl.

"Ahem. Um, Ilya..."
I prepare myself for what I have to say.
I
"I'm over it. My wound healed up, and you let me go.
 ...But I won't bring it up again if it bothers you. Is that okay?"

"Oh... yeah. Um, so you're not mad, Shirou...?"
"I probably should be mad, but I'm not for some reason.
 Actually, I want to talk to you now."

She was about to cry, but now she smiles.

That smile makes me happy as well.
I don't feel any hostility from her.
Then I should stop thinking like a Master.
I guess I'll have to talk with her, just like she wants
"I don't know you really well because we just met, but I don't hate you. At the very least, I want to be friends when you are like this."

"Really?"
"Um, you feel more like a little sister to me. And I won't bring up that incident again. ...That's all I can promise you. Can you believe me?"

"Yeah!
 I'll believe you if you say so...!"
Ilya tackles me and embraces my arm again.

"......Man. What are you?"
I complain, but I accept it. It's not bad.

I don't feel any hostility from her.
Her hugging me won't kill me, and it wouldn't be older brother-like to panic now.
I guess I'll have to talk with her, just like she wants
My talk with Ilya lasts for about an hour.
She listens to my pointless rambling and mundane stories.

...Since when did it start getting painful?
She is an innocent girl.
She's a Master and has no doubts about it...
I think her lack of fear about going into battle is sad.


A family of magi called Einzbern.
She is sent out as the greatest Master, a result of their thousand-year-old history.

If that is Ilya's goal, then...

"Ilya. Can I ask you something?"
"What?"
"Do you recognize the name Emiya Kiritsugu?"
...I have to ask her this question.


The air freezes.
The silence is dead.

"No. I don't know anyone like that."
...Her silver hair flutters.
Fairy-like, she gets up from the bench and turns around.

"It's getting late. Berserker's going to wake up at night, so I have to get going now."

Ilya waves goodbye.

"Yeah, I should go home too."
I get up.
This is all the rest I'll get.
We will be enemies again once the sun sets.

But...
"Can I talk with you again, Ilya?"
...I ask the question as if it's only natural.

"U-Um, I don't know. Do you want to see me again, Shirou?"
"Of course. I wouldn't ask you if I didn't want to."
"......! Okay, then I'll come again tomorrow if I feel like it. Don't expect too much and keep waiting, okay?"
She runs out of the park.

...But.
She suddenly stops.

"I was lying. He is someone I know."

"Ilya?"
"...I was given birth to this world to win the Holy Grail War. My mission is to kill you and Kiritsugu."

She sprints off.
She doesn't turn around.
I watch until she's out of sight.
"I'm home... huh? Fuji-Nee's home already?"
I take my shoes off and go into the hallway.
What is the archery club advisor doing, coming home so early?

"Welcome home, Shirou."
"...Hm, so you're finally home, simpleton."
Saber is sitting Japanese-style in a good manner, and Fuji-Nee has her head on the table in a bad manner.


Fuji-Nee looks utterly defeated.
...I'm curious as to why, but I'm sure it's nothing that important.

"I'm home. Did anything happen while I was gone, Saber?"
"No, I saw nothing unusual. How about you, Shirou? Did you find anything noteworthy at your school?"

"No, me neither. Shinji was absent, but school was like always. I don't think we need to worry about anything happening there"
With Fuji-Nee sitting right there, I can't just come out and say "there isn't a Master at my school."

"...Hm, I smell something. I feel a sour presence, like an old 10000 yen bill you forgot about hiding, a presence of a secret."

The lazy dog sniffs the air.

"You smell like rusted shackles, Shirou. Very suspicious.
 Are you hiding something from me-nya?"
"Whoa."
I can't believe it.
She's acting crazy.

"...Saber, did something happen with Fuji-Nee? It takes something really big to turn her this way."
"Uh... no, I did not do anything. I believe Taiga is lethargic because she is hungry."
She says those awful words quite casually.

"You're lying! You're the one who beat me up, saying you wanted to know how strong I am, Saber-chan!"
Fuji-Nee pounds on the table.

...It must have been a frightening, humiliating experience, since she's hiding behind me even as she glowers at Saber.
And I don't know when she started calling Saber Saber-chan.

"...Saber. Did you have a match with Fuji-Nee?"
"Um... I proposed that we move around if we had some free time. Since a match using shinai would not prove fatal, Taiga agreed with my proposal"

"Don't let her fool you, Shirou. Saber-chan was really about to kill me. I can tell. I know about guns.
 She was about to kill me. She really was about to kill me. She'll turn me into butter if I let my guard down!"

Fuji-Nee trembles.
"...Saber, um..."
Did she go all-out against Fuji-Nee...?

"Eh... um, I believe I let my guard down a bit.
 I was angry that you were late, and Taiga was stronger than I expected, so my reflexes took over"
...Wow, that's scary.
Fuji-Nee is a fifth-degree black belt in kendo, but Saber's on another level entirely.

"Anyway, don't go sneaking into Saber-chan's room at night if you don't wanna die!
 You'll see hell if you make a move on her! It'll be your own fault if you die!"
"......Ugh."

...Oh yeah.
There's another problem for me.
I have to do something about Saber, who is determined to sleep in the same room as me.
I'm a teenage guy. I don't know what'll happen if I sleep in the same room as someone like her

"You need not worry, Taiga. If that is Shirou's command, I can only obey.  I will never fight back."

"Hmmmm? Did you say something outrageous?"
"No. Taiga, I will be sleeping in the same room as Shirou tonight, but please do not misunderstand."
Saber states it as a matter of course.

Fuji-Nee freezes.

"......"
Here it comes...
Considering the power balance between us, it's going to be me.

"Fuji-Nee. I've kept this a secret until now, but..."
I try to pacify Fuji-Nee, who is standing behind me.

"Alrighty."
She completely ignores me, and I hear sounds of her stacking something like telephone books.

"Listen to me.
 Saber doesn't understand Japanese."
"Here I go."
Oh, I knew it.
She's doing something like a sleeper-hold on me.
Fuji-Nee doesn't know how to go easy, so it's really dangerous for her to choke someone

"No, this isn't the time for this! F-Fuji-Nee, you got me good! I'm really going to pass out...!"
I hear my bones creaking.
Continued grappling is Fuji-Nee's only reply.

"Whoa, I give up...! No, don't throw me now!"
I start to pass out, and as a last resort, I start to tap out.
But...

"Shut up, you spoiled brat! I never raised you that way!!!!"
Oh, I'm really passing out now.
...Man... Why don't my troubles come one at a time?

"Man, that was terrible."
I crack the joints in my neck.
Thanks to my training, I only got some bruises, even though I was thrown down to the floor.

"Um, I'm sorry... I was going to let go halfway so you could break your fall, but you were heavier than I thought and I had my hands full with just throwing you."

"Of course. I'm not a kid anymore. Don't try throwing me with those thin arms of yours. At worst, you would've fallen with me."
"...Sorry."

"You're at fault too, Saber. You'll be sleeping in the room next to mine, so we're technically not in the same room."
"Uh... But I need to protect you, so..."

"You can protect me well enough from there. First of all, I'll wear out if you sleep in the same room as me. I'm sorry, but that's the best compromise I can offer you.  If you want more from me, you're going to have to fight for it."

"Hmm... This is a difficult matter."

"It's fine if you two understand. Well, I guess I'll go cook dinner."
I get up while trying to loosen up my neck.

"Oh, Fuji-Nee.
 I'm thinking of having Sakura stay over starting tonight. What do you think? I figured I'd let her use the outbuilding where Saber stayed last night."

"You're going to let Sakura-chan stay over? I'm fine with that, but what's going on? You've been acting really strange these past few days."

"...Well, um, Sakura doesn't seem to be doing well recently. Shinji's not home much, so I thought it'd be better for her to have people around."

"Okay... I don't mind, but have you actually asked her? She seemed all right during club practice."

"No, I was going to ask her laterwait, what did you do about the club? Why did you leave so early?"
"Hm? Oh, someone got injured, so I left Mitsuzuri-san in charge, took the person home, and came straight here."

...So that's what happened, huh?
It's disturbing to hear someone got injured in the archery club, but Fuji-Nee wouldn't be here if it was serious.
I bet it's something like a jammed finger or anemia.


Well, this is my chance.
Fuji-Nee considers Sakura a part of the family, just like I do.
Then
I guess I'll have Fuji-Nee ask Sakura.
She's older than all of us, so she might be able to talk Sakura into staying here.

"Fuji-Nee. Can you ask Sakura to stay over at my place?"
"Why? There's no way I'm getting involved with what's between you two.
 You're the one who came up with the idea, so you go ask her."

"Hey, I want to ask her myself, but I'm sure she'll refuse.
 I bet she'll be troubled if a guy asks her to stay over at his place.
 ...Normally it wouldn't bother me if she refused, but I can't afford to screw up this time. I need her to stay over here for a while."

"......Geez. You're always so dense.
 All right, I'll ask Sakura-chan. So, should I have her stay over for like a week?"
"Yeah. I think things will calm down by then."

Oh.
The doorbell rings at just the right moment.

"Excuse me."
I hear Sakura's voice.
"I'm going to go ask her. You go prepare dinner, okay?"
Fuji-Nee unenthusiastically goes to greet Sakura.
...Hmm.
Did I choose the wrong person for the job?

"Sakura-chan agreed. I showed her to the guest room and she'll be here in a minute."
She says this rather carelessly as she sits down by the table.

"HuhSakura agreed to stay over?"
"Of course she did, you blockhead."
She answers while peeling a mandarin.


Okay.
I don't know how Fuji-Nee did it, but I guess asking her was the right thing to do.

No, this is an important matter.
I can't let other people handle it when it was my idea in the first place. It's not in good faith if I don't ask her myself.

...Oh.
I hear the doorbell.
"Excuse me."
I hear Sakura's voice from the entrance.
I guess I should strike while the iron's hot and go ask her right now.

"Oh, hello, Senpai. Are you about to cook dinner?"
"Yeah. I'm going to cook by myself today, so you can relax. But please look after Fuji-Nee. She lost confidence in herself because Saber beat her mercilessly. Try to finish her off and play something like Othello with her."

"Oh, that's terrible, Senpai. Today was a hard day for Fujimura-Sensei."
"...Oh yeah, she did mention something about that. Then play shogi with her."

"Shogi, huh? Okay, Fujimura-Sensei is the master at that.
 She beats me even when she gives me a handicap."

Sakura's in a good mood.
Her bruise appears to be healing, and her earlier gloominess seems to have disappeared.
Yeah, this is a good time to ask.

"So, Sakura. I know it's a bit sudden, but could you stay over at my place starting tonight?"
"Huh? Stay over at your place...?"
"I'm telling you not to go back to the Matou household for a while. Let's see... I want you to stay over for like a week. Oh, I already got Fuji-Nee's approval."

"......"
Sakura's face stiffens.
She stares at me, as if peering into my mind.

"I know I'm being unreasonable. But I'll have you stay over no matter what. I don't care what you think of me, but please stay at my place for a while."


Sakura doesn't answer.
She stares at me silently...

"Why is that?"
...And then asks me that question.

"......"
I can't tell her why.
I can't tell her that Shinji's a Master, and anything else would just be a lie.
Everyone has their secrets.
I'm a guy, so I have many secrets I can't tell Fuji-Nee or Sakura.

...There are things you just can't say, not even to the people most important to you.
But that's also why I can't lie.
Sakura's an important family member to me, so I can't lie to her.

"......"
The air feels like it's freezing over.
The silence seems to last forever, and Sakura hangs her head awkwardly.
I put my stupid brain to work, trying to come up with something to say.

"Do I really have to tell you, Sakura?"
She doesn't respond.
Instead, she just looks at me with a concerned expression.
"...Is it because you're worried about me?"
And she clearly states this.

"Yeah, I'm worried about you. It'll help me out if you stay here."
...Her long hair sways.
Sakura nods in response...
...She answers not with her words, but with a brilliant smile.
A high-pitched sound rings out.
The brilliant moonlight glints off the drawn sword as it clatters to the stairs.
"Hah."
Blood is on his lips.
The man on his knees on the stone steps bids his longsword goodbye as it falls away.

His arms are the next to fall.
Wet with blood, the elegantly-patterned fabric of his battlecoat looks like a giant red flower.

"My. I did not think you were of the serpent's kind."
In steep contrast to his bloody body, his lips are white.
Neither breath nor blood passes his throat now.
Sasaki Kojirou's internal organs no longer serve their original purpose.

The mountain gate is quiet.
The Servant that guarded the place, the shadow that appeared...
Neither of them move.
The battle has already ended.
Assassin was defeated by "someone" who came up the stone steps.
He had no time to identify the intruder as an enemy, let alone cross swords.
This "someone" was on a different level to begin with.

Assassin's body bursts open.
Torn, mutilated, and weaponless, he cannot even take his own life.
The shadow approaches.
It strokes Assassin's cheek with a scornful cherishing gesture.

A deformed, spider-like hand comes out of his stomach.
His bones crack.
His flesh rips apart.
It feels as if his organs are turning into someone else's.

"Guh!"
Assassin suppresses the regurgitating blood.
The swordsman swallows the blood and smiles with his pale lips.

"...Very well, do as you wish. After all, this is coming out of me. I'm sure it is nothing noble"
He smiles, even though he is denied an honorable death.
If one talks about a grand spectacle...
His smile is grander than the spawning of this abomination.

And thus, it is summoned.
Taking the false Servant's flesh as its own, the true Assassin enters our world.
"KiKiki, kikikikiki"
His first cries sound like those of an insect.
The black insect that crawled from the swordsman's stomach devours the body that was his own nursery.

He giggles while tearing the flesh apart.
He laughs while crunching on the bones.

Every time he does so, the insect becomes more like a man, and the empty brain acquires human wisdom.
And after a while...
He has finished sipping every last bit of the blood and blesses the birth of his own self, the "assassin".

The only ones to witness are the chorus of insects and the shining moonlight.
The high-pitched birth cry melts into the darkness.

An ominous moon.
    A white skull laughs under the black-burned sky.
After eating dinner, one only needs to take a bath and go to sleep.
This is common knowledge, barely worthy of mention.
So there's no problem.
Something so mundane couldn't possibly cause a problem.

       But...

"...Um, Fujimura-Sensei. I need to discuss something with you..."
"What is it? Go ahead and ask me."
"Um... Well......"

"Oh, right. You need something to change into.  Hmm, I guess there are school uniforms at my place. I can give you some of my clothes if you don't mind. Oh, or would you rather go to your place to get some clothes?"
"...No, I would rather not go home, since I wouldn't be able to come back here. Um, about Nii-san..."

"Oh, that's all right. I just called your place and got your grandfather's permission. He said he doesn't mind having you over at my place since I'm a teacher."
"R-Really!? Then I can really stay over here!?"
"Yup. So, about your change of clothes... you don't mind using my pajamas, right? Oh, do you want to use the same underwear too?"

"Oh... No, um... I think your bra would be too tight on me..."
"Hm. Yeah, you have big boobs.
 ...............Give me some of that."
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa! What are you doing, Sensei!?"
"Ahahahahaha, I'm just joking. ...But this is troubling. I don't have a bra your size. Are you the kind that keeps your bra on when you sleep?"

"Uh... um, yes."
"Yeah, people with big boobs tend to do that. But isn't it uncomfortable?"
"...I-It is, but what you do is........."

"I see, I see! It sure is good to be young! Then I'll get the guys at my place to buy some for you by tomorrow morning. So don't worry, just go ahead and take your bath."
"......"

"!"
S-So why are you two having this conversation right in front of me!?
I'm a guy! If you two talk about that, I won't even be able to look at Sakura without thinking...

"Ohhh? Why the red face, Shirou? Are you curious about what Sakura-chan had to say?"
"! H-Heh, what are you talking about? It's a secret between you two. I didn't hear it, and I'm not curious!"

"Oh, really? Then I'll give you an interesting piece of info. Sakura-chan is an 85. She's an E-cup. Isn't it amazing? It's 13 centimeters bigger than last year.
 I bet you noticed it too. How sexy her body is and how much you want to touch her."

"Y-You!"
"F-Fujimura-Sensei!
 I told you in secret so that he wouldn't hear it!! Why are you telling him like that!?"

"Huh? Huh? Kyaaaaa!?"

"Youidiot, Fuji-Nee..."
I finish my thought in a whisper.
Fuji-Nee falls to Sakura's counterattack.
Sakura's face is red, and she is trying to cover Fuji-Nee's mouth.

...Sakura...
I understand wanting to prevent Fuji-Nee from talking, but if you keep this up, you'll kill her...

"Haa, haa, haawow, I didn't know you were that strong, Sakura-chan. I'm surprised that you came to stop my breath right away."
"Geez! Please contemplate your actions, Fujimura-Sensei!"
Sakura gets away from Fuji-Nee.
Naturally...
Our eyes meet.

"Oh."
"Ehh, um, the towel's in the dressing room."
"O-Okay...! Um excuse me for a while, Senpai...!"

Sakura hurries out to the hallway.
"Oh"
But if she runs like that...

"Ow... I hit my nose......"
...I wanted to warn her that she'd fall...
...But she exceeds my expectations and runs straight into the wall.

"Are you all right, Sakura!?"
Was she that eager to get away?
"Yeah, I'm all right. I'm fine, so I'm going to go take a bath."
Sakura disappears into the hallway.

"Phew."
With Sakura gone, I relax.
...As tense as things were getting, I would've had to flee the room in embarrassment if she hadn't left first.

"Hah."
"...What? Go ahead and say it if you want to say something, you failure of a teacher."

"Noooothing. I'm just thinking how hard it must be for Sakura-chan. 
 I bet Sakura-chan was even more embarrassed in front of you."

"I-I'm not blushing! Hey, Sakura is like a family member to me. She's cooked for me and we've eaten together for a long time! I-I'd be a failure as her Senpai if I were embarrassed!"

"Oh, so you don't want to be a failure?"
"Of course not. Sakura is Shinji's sister. If I'm having a friend's sister over, I have to take care of her."

"What...? Oh, I see now. I just thought you were dense, but that's part of it too, huh?"
Fuji-Nee sighs.
This is troubling.

"Sakura-chan has a lot of trouble ahead of her."
"Hey, where are you going?"
"I'm going to the dressing room. I have to go get Sakura-chan some change of clothes. You can go to the outbuilding and prepare a room for her. Get her some new sheets, okay?"
Fuji-Nee leaves after giving me an order.

"...Heh. Stay here, Saber. I'm going to go prepare the guest room."
I leave after seeing Saber nod.

I make the bed and check the furniture.
I decided to have Sakura use a guest room that isn't normally used.
This room is more suited to her, and the door can be locked.
...Sakura's a girl, so that should be better for her.

"...Well, it's not like Fuji-Nee made me choose this room."
I make the bed.
This bed has never been used.
The moment I think that Sakura will sleep in this bed tonight...

'I bet you noticed it too.'

"!"
...Indecent thoughts fill my head.

"D-Don't be stupid! I"
...I already know that, without being told.
I've seen Sakura hit puberty, getting more beautiful by the day.
It was a good thing, but I also persuaded myself not to notice it.
I've always told myself that she's Shinji's sister and that she only comes to cook for me because she feels guilty about what Shinji did.

"...It's been a year and a half, hasn't it? It's nothing Sakura should care about."
The accident that caused me to quit the archery club...
I injured my shoulder, he complained about the burn, and I took the opportunity to leave the club.
...And Sakura proposed to help me out until my injury healed.

She was like a child back then.
She waited for me in front of my house one day, but it took two hours of awkward silence before she worked up the courage to say she wanted to help me.

"That shy Sakura is the rising star of the archery club now. Man, how a person can change."

Sakura is cheerful now.
I first met her four years ago when I went to Shinji's house after getting to know him.

She was quiet and had a habit of hiding her face with her hair.
...Well, she still is, but she was really lifeless back then. She always looked depressed and would just absent-mindedly stand there.
Considering that, it's wonderful to see how Sakura is doing now.
It relieves me to see Sakura, the girl who only used to look downcast, smile.

'I bet you noticed it too. How sexy her body is, how much you want to touch her.'


...I don't really know.
She was always just my underclassman.
But recently, that changed.
...I don't know if it happened recently or if I only started to notice it just now.
Or...
Was she so close to me that I didn't have to notice?

"...Damn. It's been peaceful until now. So why..."
Why is my mind going crazy from just having Sakura stay over?
I'm being inconsiderate of her.
I'll finish cleaning and show her to her room

"Huh? Where's Sakura, Saber?"
"I do not know. She is not here yet, so I would assume she is still in the bath."
"...? But it's been an hour already."

...Well, perhaps she takes long baths.
After all, she has more places to wash

"! Stop, stop, stop...! Don't imagine indecent things!"
I shake my head and sit down at the table.
I pour myself some tea and drink it.

"Phew."
I shake off the image in my head and relax.
...Then.
"Shirou. Does Sakura have bad eyesight?"
Saber asks me a strange question.

"...? No, Sakura has good eyesight.
 I think she has 1.5 vision."
"I see. She often runs into walls, so I was worried that she might have bad vision."

"Oh, I see. Thanks for worrying, but Sakura's fine. She's clumsy now because she's tired. She's usually more reliable than me."

"I hope so. ...But even in that case, it is a problem if she is tired enough to mistake the wall for a door. This is only my personal opinion, but I believe it was not caused by fatigue."


That's a very natural conclusion.
Even if you're tired, you still shouldn't be running into walls.

"......"
Where is Sakura anyway?
Even if she's taking a bath, an hour is too long.
I
I should go check on her.
If Saber's right, this isn't the time to be hung up on embarrassment.

"Sakura."
I call out to her from the hallway.
There's no reply from inside the dressing room.
No, I don't even feel a presence in there.

"Sakura...? Hey, are you in there, Sakura?"
I knock on the door.
...I gradually start to knock harder, and I'm banging on the door before I notice.

"Sakura...! Hey, say something...!"
My anxiety turns to cold certainty.
...Something's wrong.
I can't go inside, so I'll have to get Saber or Fuji-Nee

"Huh? S-Senpai? Why are you so flustered?"
"S-Sakura...!? ...Oh, it's nothing. I was wondering if something was wrong, since you were in there for a while."

"A while...? Was I in here that long?"
"...?"
Sakura sounds absent-minded.
She sounds lost in thought, as if she'd just woken up.

"...Sakura. Don't tell me you were..."
"......Yes. It was so relaxing that I fell asleep a bit..."
"YYou idiot. Don't scare me like that."
I crumple down to the floor.

"...I'm sorry. I'll get out right away."
"Please do. ...Man, you'll catch a cold if you sleep in the bathtub."

I lean against the wall.
...It turned out to be nothing, but I'm glad Sakura's okay.
She should be better once she gets a good night's sleep.

"Huh?"
I hear the sound of something heavy falling.
It came from the other side of the door.

"Sakura!?"
There's no reply.
I feel no presence on the other side of the door.

"...! I'm coming in, Sakura!"
I rush into the dressing room.
There, I see Sakura on the floor.

"Sakura, Sakura...!"
I hold Sakura up in my arms.
Her body is soft and surprisingly hot.

"Ahhm"
She doesn't seem to be conscious, but she's moaning in pain.
Her hand grabs her chest, as if wanting to take her shirt off.

"Haa......"
She gasps.
...This is way too much for me.
Her body is soft, and her hair is unraveled.
Her shirt is the only thing between my arms and her body, and this isn't the Sakura I know.

Her shirt sticks to her body and emphasizes her large breasts, and I can't take my eyes off of them.
Her breasts move up and down along with her breaths, exposing her white neck.


It feels like my heart will leap out of my chest.
My head wouldn't be this hot even if I drank a love potion.
I realize that my mouth is watering, and I swallow with great difficulty.

"Ah... Hm......"
Her beautiful lips make my head go wild.
Her body is so hot and soft that it makes me imagine how good it must taste.

My head goes blank.
It's not a girl's body I'm holding, but a woman's.
This isn't the Sakura I know.
Thenit shouldn't be a problem if I hold her a little

"...! What the hell am I thinking...!?"
I shake my head.
This isn't the time.
Even considering that Sakura just got out of the bath, her temperature isn't normal.
Moreversimple anemia wouldn't make her clutch at herself like that.

"Sakura! Hey, are you all right, Sakura...!?"
I call out to her.
"Ahfua...?"
...The hairs sticking to her forehead drop down.
Sakura slowly opens her eyes and stares at me.

"Huh? Senpai...? Why are you here...?"
"Hey, it's not 'Why am I here?'...! You should've told me if you're sick!"
"Huh...? II'm sick?"

"Who else would it be...!? Try feeling your forehead! It's burning hot!"
"Huh? But I don't feel hot at all..."
Sakura must still be half-asleep, as she is still in a daze.

"Just don't move! I'm going to take you to your bed...!"
"Kya...!? What's going on, Senpai...!?"
"I'm taking you to your room. Don't struggle, okay? I don't know if I can keep a hold if you do."
I lift up Sakura in my arms and go out to the hallway.

"...! S-S-Senpai, you're carrying me!?"
I must have surprised her, as she clings on to my neck.

"!"
I feel something soft on my chest, but I have to ignore it for now...!

"Man, this is harder than my daily training...!"
It's a matter of speed now.
I have to carry Sakura to her room before my reasoning disappears...!

"Let's see. Your temperature is a bit over 37 degrees. Oh, it's lower than I thought."
I put the medical thermometer down and look at Sakura.

"...I'm sorry... I guess I got dizzy since I was so nervous."
Sakura hides her face with the futon.

"You can't help catching a cold, right? You should be better by tomorrow if you drink some medicine and get a good night's sleep.
I'll leave some water here on the chair, so don't go out of the building, okay? You'll cool your body if you go outside."
I put another blanket over her, just in case, and turn the lights off.

"All right. I'll come wake you up tomorrow morning, so you just take it easy until then."
I pat her on her head, then start to walk to the door.
Then...
Something pulls me back.
"...?"
I turn around to see that Sakura's holding my sleeve.

"Sakura...? Um, I can't leave if you're holding onto my shirt like that."
"Huh?"
She must have been doing it unconsciously, since she jerks her hand away when she realizes it.

"I-I'm sorry, Senpai...! I-I-I wasn't thinking...!"
Sakura jumps up and tries to make an excuse.
Even in the dark, I can tell that she's blushing furiously.

"Um, are you scared, Sakura?"
"......I am. It's scary to sleep alone in a place I don't know."
Her hair is hiding her face, so I can't see her expression.
...But right now she seems just like the shy girl I met years ago.

"I see. You must be uneasy, sleeping in an unfamiliar room with a cold."
I sit down on the floor.
I lay my back against her bed.
It's for the best, because I don't think I can face Sakura right now.

"U-Um, Senpai...?"
"I'll stay here for a while. You should get used to the room in a little bit, and I'll go if you fall asleep before that.
 To be honest, I'm worried that you might push yourself. I'll stay here for at least thirty minutes, so lay down and relax."
I raise my hand and flutter it.

"Okay. Then please keep me company for just a bit."

I feel a slight movement of air.
It must be Sakura pulling up her blanket.
...I'm glad I can help Sakura like this.
This is nothing compared to what she has done for me.



The sound of the clock ticking echoes through the dark room.
I don't know if it's because I have my back to her, or because I saw her sad face.
But the emotions that assailed me when I carried Sakura have disappeared, and I'm able to calmly stare at the clock.
...And after a long period of silence...

"Are you awake, Senpai?"
A gentle voice lights up the darkness.

"..."
I nod in response.
That must have been good enough...

"...Okay. Thank you for everything you did today."
...And Sakura falls asleep peacefully.
...Yeah.
Fuji-Nee would make fun of me for a whole year if I did go and happened to walk in on Sakura changing.

"I can't do that to Sakura."
Yes, I should sit tight and wait.
She might be already out and drying her hair.

"You are restless, Shirou."
"Huh? I-I don't think so. I'm eating my mandarin and drinking my tea."
"So you relax by not eating or drinking and looking often at the clock?"

"Ugh. Um, I have no appetite because I'm full."
"I see. I do not mind if you say so. But I do not believe it is a good idea to hold yourself back."

Saber elegantly sips her tea.
...Man, I'm hopeless!
It hasn't even been five minutes yet, but I'm really worried about Sakura!

"Man, I don't care what Fuji-Nee says!
 Saber, I'm going to the bathroom!"
I make up my mind and stand up.
At that moment...

Fuji-Nee comes running in.

"Fuji-Nee...? Why are you in such a rush? Weren't you preparing for Sakura's stay?"
"I finished that already. More importantly, can you look after Sakura-chan? I'm going back to my house to get some medicine."
"...!? What's wrong with Sakura, Fuji-Nee?"

"That's what I want to know. Sakura-chan was on the floor when I went to the dressing room, and she has a fever of almost 38 degrees."

"Whawhere's Sakura, Fuji-Nee...!?"
"I just carried her to the guest room. I think she just has a cold, so don't worry too much.
 But we can't push her. I'm going back to my place to get some stuff, so you just be there for Sakura-chan, okay? That should provide plenty of energy for her all by itself."

Fuji-Nee fires off my instructions and goes back to her house.
The Fujimura household has perfect preparations for illness and injuries, as it has lots of "those" kind of people.

"......!"
This isn't the time to stand around in shock.
I have to go check on Sakura...!

"Let's see. Your temperature is a bit over 37 degrees. Oh, it's lower than I thought."
I put the medical thermometer down and look at Sakura.
It's been thirty minutes.
Her condition wasn't that bad, just like Fuji-Nee said. She has a slight cold, and she collapsed in the dressing room because she felt dizzy after staying in the bath for too long.

"...I'm sorry... I guess I got dizzy since I was so nervous."
Sakura hides her face with her futon.

"You can't help catching a cold, right? You should be better by tomorrow if you drink some medicine and get a good night's sleep.
I'll leave some water here on the chair, so don't go out of the building, okay? You'll cool your body if you go outside."
I put another blanket over her, just in case, and turn the lights off.

"All right. I'll come wake you up tomorrow morning, so you can rest easy until then."
I pat her on her head, then walk to the door.
"...Yes. Good night, Senpai."
Sakura sounds apologetic.
I bid her goodnight and leave her room.
The lights go out.
It's eleven o'clock, and the town is going to sleep.

"So there is a Master at the Ryudou Temple?"
"According to Tohsaka. She said we shouldn't fight them because they are troublesome enemies, but it seems the coma incidents in town are their doing. ...I don't know if it's true or not, but we have to find out."

"...You are right. I do feel something intentional in the ley line pointing to the Ryudou Temple. I am sure that a Master is on that mountain."
"...? What's wrong, Saber? You seem like you're not up for it. You have less spirit than last night."

"You are right. That mountain is an ominous place for Servants.
 I would like to avoid careless attacks."

"...Hm. Should we just patrol the town tonight and put off attacking the Ryudou Temple until we get more information? It is reckless to go attack them when we don't know anything about our enemy."

"No, there is no need for that. A Master that would set up his base in the Ryudou Temple would not readily reveal his identity. If we are to quickly defeat him, we must face them straight on and power through."

Saber is determined.
...She must believe we have a chance.  Either way, if the Master at the temple is responsible for all the recent coma victims, we have to do something.

"All right, let's go to the Ryudou Temple.
 But we're only going to investigate tonight.
 We'll retreat once we find out who the Master is and what Servant he has. I'd like to do more, but I can't support you, so I want to be cautious."

I can't allow Saber to get hurt, just like the fight with Berserker.
If I can't help her directly, I have to protect her in some other way.

"......Understood. I shall entrust you with the final judgment. Please decide then if we are to retreat or fight."
"...Hm. I'm glad to hear that, but it's also scary. I might wuss out even if the enemy is weak."

"I see. That is certainly a possibility, since you have little experience in battle."
"Yeah, that's right. I want to avoid heading into a minefield, so please warn me."

"Understood. Then I shall do so if you make a wrong choice.
 You will learn little if I merely warn you, so I shall impose a penalty if you make a mistake."
"...Hey, what do you mean by 'penalty'?"

"Where would the enjoyment be in telling you?  I shall keep it a secret, since this is one of the few pleasures I have."
...Ugh.
That joke isn't very Saber-like. It must be Fuji-Nee's influence.
I really do hope it's just a joke.

"But putting that aside, Shirou... will Sakura be all right?  She seemed unusually distressed."
"I thought so too, but I didn't see anything unusual when I took her temperature. I'll let her get a good night's sleep and see how she is tomorrow."

"I see. Then we can head out into battle without worry."
I nod and look at the outbuilding.
Sakura's room is on the second floor.
I have to leave without her noticing, and I have to come back as if nothing has happened.

"Let's go, Saber. I have to act like a Master now. I won't think about anything else."

I leave with Saber at my side.
High overhead, clouds pass before the moon, and the darkness deepens.
The wind is blowing the overhead clouds.
Lit by fading moonlight, we start running towards enemy territory.
It's already after two in the morning.
Despite my daily training, running to the Ryudou Temple and back is still tiring.

"...Oh. Can you go ahead to your room, Saber?"
"...? Where are you going, Shirou? Are we not finished for the night?"

"Yeah. I'll be back in a minute, so don't worry. I'm tired too, so I want to rest soon."
"I see. You must be worried about Sakura."

"Uh, I have to go take her some water. You go sleep in the room next to mine, Saber. Close the door, okay?"

"Oh, yes.  It will do little good if we are not in the same room, but there is nothing to be done if you insist on being stubborn. I shall stand by in the room next to yours."

Saber looks discontented.
...Humph.
You're stubborn as well.

"Oh... Man."
I return to my room, filled with self-hatred.
"It's 3 AM... What was I doing for an hour in there?"

I let out a heavy sigh.
There's only one simple explanation.
Sakura looked like she wasn't sleeping well, so I took time adjusting her blanket and bringing her fresh water.

Such simple tasks were really painful and difficult for me.
It's all because...
...Sakura looked so alluring in her sleep.

"I wish I had a blindfold or something."
That would've solved everything.
...Well, I had my eyes closed anyway, but a blindfold would've prevented me from giving in to temptation and opening them!

"Man, why am I so easily excited!?"
Man, I have a hyper imagination.
It's all Sakura's fault for growing so big.
How can she mature like that in just a year...!?

"That's it, I'm going to sleep. I'm gonna sleep, I'm gonna sleep, I'm gonna sleep!"
I pull the blanket over my face and shake off my indecent thoughts.


I'll close my eyes and clear my mind.
...See.
My body's tired, so I should be able to go to sleep right away

  Hmm...!! Aha, ahh, ahh, ha...!

It's red.
I'm in the depths of pitch black sleep, but there's someone in this red classroom.

Fua, haa, ahit feels good, Emiya-kunit's in so deep...! ...Ah, I can feel it all the way up into my head

I hear a familiar voice.
I hear dripping sounds along with smacking sounds.

...! Ah, don't mix me upnha, hah, nhaaaaa...!

I hear a perverted voice.
I feel skin beneath my fingers.
The haze in my mind clears a bit.
...I'm sleepy.
I'm sleepy, but if I hear that voice, I have no choice but to get up.

I open my eyes.
When did the sun set?
I'm joining in her secrecy in this desolate classroom.

"Good. You're here, Emiya-kun."

Her sticky voice is filled with anticipation for an outrage.
Her cheeks are flushed, and she smiles lasciviously as if she cannot contain her lust.

"What's wrong...? Nobody will trouble us here.
 You can do whatever you want with me, just like always."

The woman comes near me.
Unable to wait, I pull her closer.
"Mm, fuh......!"
We kiss.
We devour each other's mouths. We fight for each other's tongues, saliva, and even the air in our lungs.

"Mm, haa, hm......!!"
I feel dizzy.
I'm still groggy from waking up.
Wanting to feel something, I let my hands roam over the woman's slender waist, her firm breasts, and her sculpted collarbone.
Not knowing who I am, I keep violating the person in front of me.

"Ahhmm... You're rough. You're acting different today, Emiya-kun."
Does she want to catch her breath, or does she want it now?
She pushes away, and...

Look.
       I'm already like this.

...She takes off her skirt.
The classroom is instantly filled with the smell of woman.
The light shines wetly off of her exposed flesh.

The scent of woman fills the air.
The sight of her bare legs makes it even harder to focus.

I'm like an insect attracted to honey.
I expose my erect self and advance to devour the flesh in front of me.

"...Geez. This is no different from usual."

She gives a mischievous smile.
She pokes my nose with her finger and...
"Herefuck me from behind."
She twists her hips suggestively.

"...Hm, ku!"
I penetrate her without hesitation.
There's no need for foreplay. She's so wet that her juice will start dripping if I wait any longer.

"Ahh...! Emiya-kun's penetrating me"
I push myself in.
My dick feels like it's boiling, but she feels hotter still.

I feel nauseous.
It's like she's squeezing the cum out of me.
The pleasure courses through me like electricity, blowing away my drowsiness and blanking my mind.

"Haahh, ah... What's wrong...? Won't you come deeper inside of me...?"
Her sweet voice pulls me back to this world.
I expand inside her in response to her warmth.

"Hmm...! Aha, yes, like that, more...!"
It's as if there's no limit.
My penis expands her walls and the sexual desire fills up to my fingertips.

"Auu...! Hmm, hm...! It's coming in...!"
I move my hips.
Even when I try to pull out, her walls contract to draw me back in.

"Ahh, ha! Ahh, it's so bigahh, haaI'm going crazyI... feel like I'm penetrated, all, throughout my body"
She clamps down even more.
I break myself loose and keep moving.
I move slowly at first, then faster and faster.

"...!? Ah, nha, ahh...! Ahh, no, ahn, oh, fuh, haa...!"
I show her no consideration.
My grotesque meat stabs into her, striking against her womb.

"Haa, ah! You're tearing me!"
Her body stiffens.
Her breathing matches the rhythm of her hips and her hair tosses in the air.

"Ahh, it, ahh... it feels good, Emiya-kunmore, push it in harder!"
The dizziness intensifies.
This feels too real to be a dream, but this could never happen in real life, and those facts confuse me.

Her lewdness is a great nightmare.
Her anus is defenseless.
It contracts every time I move, looking like a second reproductive opening.
Tohsaka's anus.
The dirtiest part of her is right in front of me.

"Hm, ah...! Ahh, hah, ah...! Ahh, it feels good, Emiya-kun, ah, it's rubbing me...!"
Our intercourse does not stop.
The sensation of squishing a ripe fruit.
The drilled holeno, the point of our connection is wet and the juice dirties her thighs.

It's not just her that's dirtied.
Her vulgar juice overflows from her crevice and sticks to me.

"Haa, nha, ah! ...Ahh, ahh... ahaha... aha, I'm like a dogthis feels good"

The woman raises her hips higher.
The movement gets heavier.
Her ass is larger than one would imagine just by looking at her.
I dig my fingers into it and hold her in place.

"...Haa, hah, haa, ah...!"
I hear the sweet sound of her juices.
The woman's voice is close to a scream.
She puts her chin up with every stroke, begging for more.

"Aha... ahh... it's so loud
 Ahh, it feels goodgive me more, Emiya-kun...!"
Her firm butt shakes.
She frantically keeps control of her body that's about to crumple from the pleasure.

The dizziness turns into pain.
The sperm in my testicles is about to burst out.

"Nha...! It's getting biggerfuh, ah, ah, hmm...!"
It must be the same for her.
She struggles, as if to get away from my thrusting.
Her arching back, the different angles, the squeezing walls...
She convulses in response to my wild thrusts.

"Hi, hia, ah, hm! Ah, it hurts...!"
Her walls entangle around my penis. Her skin is covered in sweat.
The wet flesh wraps around the head of my shaft.
It's like a diving suit that's too small.
I force myself into the tight hole.

"...!! Ah, haa, nhaa...! No, ah...! I, I...!"
I reach it.
I can't put a lid on my overflowing desire.

"Hmlet it out! I want your cum, Emiya-kun...!"
She's right. There's no need to hold back.
I thrust myself into the deepest part of her and release my cum.

"Nha... hm, it's hot... it's... still coming out and hitting me."
It doesn't all splash out.
I slowly ejaculate over a long period of time.

The sheer, impossible volume makes me realize.
This is a dream.
I'm so tired, as if I ejaculated all my blood.
The ejaculation spanning a few minutes is a great pleasure as well as torture.

"Wowyou let out a lot... and it's splashing inside of me."
...I'm starting to pass out.
Everything, from my unending climax to Tohsaka's trembling back, feels like an impossible dream

So, why is it not ending?
All that's left is to sleep, but it doesn't end.
Noif this is a dream, then there's no guarantee that I'd return to reality even if I did fall asleep.

"Hm... Let's keep going, Emiya-kunyou want to feel better, right?"

Her voice echoes in my brain.
My body does not move.
I've ejaculated half my organs, after all.  What human could move after such a feat?

"......I see. Then it's my turn."

I hear her snicker.
...When did I fall onto the desk?
I'm on my back, and the woman crawls over my body like a lizard.

"Hm... hold stillI'm going to eat you."

She blows her sweet breath on my neck.

"!"
My body jumps.
Despite my numbed brain, my sexual desire still rushes forth.

"Hm... it's already in... Hm, fuh... it's a bit hardbut yours feels good, Emiya-kun..."
We become one with a sound.

"Ah, haa... Does it feel good...? It's already erect, Emiya-kun, ah, haan...!"

Tohsaka's flesh is completely wrapped around me.
My empty body is filled anew with pleasure.
She's demanding too much. Even if she demands it, I have nothing I can give back to her.

"Ahh... ahh, nha, haa, ah!"
But she doesn't care.
She grinds her hips against me.
She wraps around me and tries to take me in, just like a pure girl's confession of love.

"Haa, like this? I'm letting it loosebut does it feel good...?"
Tohsaka lowers herself onto me in an almost gentle caress.
But her slow movement has the opposite effect.
I'm going mad with the torture.

"Hm... is it painful, Emiya-kun...?
 Hmm... I'm sorry... I'll make you feel good right away"
Tohsaka contracts her muscles and moves.
She doesn't notice my limit and keeps caressing me with her clumsy knowledge.

"Ah, hm...! Hah, so you did want more. See, it's fully erect now."
I... can't believe it.
I ejaculated so much, and there's still more?

"Ah, mm...! Haa, aha... Don't move. I'll movenfu, hmm, ahhh...!"
...She slowly starts to move faster.
I don't know if it's because I'm not moving, or if she's just too caught up in the pleasure.

"Ah... ha, ah... it's so good... and this is rather pleasant. Having you under me to do with as I please."
She's panting like a girl indulging in masturbation.

"Hmm, faa, mm...! Ah, it feels so good...!"
She looks too horny to be called lovely.
But Tohsaka is pure, a virgin who knows no men.

"Aha, ah...! ...Emiya-kun!
 ...Fuaa, noI can't stop my fingersyour dick is enough to fill me up, but...!"

I get an urge to violate the girl in front of me.
My erect penis pushes into her.

"...! Ah, haa...! It's coming in so deep...!"
I break through her hymen.
The sequence of events is backwards, but I don't care.
Pain turns into pleasure, and Tohsaka demands even more.

"Haa, aha, hau...! I need more, keep moving! Mix me up...!"
Tohsaka moves her fingers while drowning in pleasure.
She seeks greater pleasure by fondling herself.

"Fua...! Ah, mm...!"

She doesn't stop.
The slit holding me in is wet with both our fluids.

"Ahh, fuaa, ahh, nohmm, ou... Ah...!!"
She rubs her own juice onto her clit and puts even more weight on me.

The pleasure doubles.
My dick expands to avoid being crushed.


I want to ejaculate.
It feels so good.
Her ass is soft and her thighs are smooth, urging me to orgasm.

"Haa, mm, no, ahh...! No, it's hot inside...!"
She squeezes down on me like a leech.
Many needles poke at my nerves.
Her walls stimulate, penetrate, and release my sexual desire.


I bear it with all my might.
The tattered remnants of my reason tell me that it's dangerous to succumb to the pleasure.

"Hmno, you can't do thatyou have to"

Be devoured by me here.

", "
I let it out.
My brain burns up from the great ejaculation.

"Ahahm, it tastes so goodyour sperm is so strong that it tickles"
Tohsaka accepts my cum.
...Is it because this is a dream?
It should be dripping out of her, but none of it is flowing out.

...But that's a trivial matter.
I can finally go to sleep now.
I am utterly dry, and it should be impossible for Tohsaka to go on.
She pushed herself in spite of this being her first time, so her pussy is covered in blood.
Tohsaka is at her limit, just like me.

So this is the end.
The dream should end here, but...
"Hmm... I want more"
Our sex starts again, like a tape that has been rewound.

It doesn't stop.
Our bodies start convulsing again, declaring it's not enough.
Ignoring the protests of my mind, they seek more pleasure.


It's a long afternoon.
I melt into Tohsaka in this empty classroom.

"Yeah... this is great, Emiya-kunI'll serve you nicely"

Her lovely voice echoes inside my head.
As we desire each other, I will stay in this dream until the afternoon ends
Light flows in.
The warmth I feel through my eyelids informs me that it is morning.

I turn over and look away from the light.
"Hm"
I still feel sleepy.
Judging by the feel of the air, it's around 5:30.


I went to bed late last night.
I came home from the church, forced Saber to sleep in the other building, and finally went to sleep myself around 3AM.
...I don't know if I can cope with getting only two hours of sleep.
It was a frenetic, exhausting day yesterday.
Nobody can blame me if I sleep for another 30 minu

"Huh?"
I think I saw something.
It's by my futon.
It seems something big is by my futon.

"......"
...Come to think of it, I feel someone's presence.
I feel restless, as if someone is watching me. So this means

"Saber......!"
"Yes, what is it, Shirou?"
"W-Why are you in my room!? I gave you a separate room last night!"

I leap up from the futon to my feetno, I stop myself at the last second.
I can't show her my lower half because... um... it's morning.

"Yes, and I think there is a problem with it. You directed me to a room, but that room is not close enough to yours. I need to be by your side so that I may protect you."

"H-Hold on, just get away from me...!
 Just get away, please get away, no, I'll get away if you won't...!"

Still rolled up in my futon, I scramble away from Saber.
"...?"
Saber looks at me with wonder.

Man, what does she think of a healthy guy of my age!?
I get nervous from just having her close to me, so it's really shocking if she's sitting by my side when I wake up. And it was a surprise attack too!  If my composure were an army, that would've just annihilated it.

"Shirou. As I was saying."
"Ugh... you mean the room?"

"Yes. We should sleep in the same room to be safe.
 The boundary field on this house is excellent, but it only serves as a warning. It will do nothing to shield you if we are attacked here."
"......"

Saber has a point, but I wish she would consider the state of my nerves.
I'll go crazy before any enemy attacks us if I sleep in the same room with Saber.
It's not like I'll be with Saber all the time, so we should distance ourselves

"Oh."
I totally forgot about it.
I have school today...!

"Shirou? Why are you so pale? I have noticed that you make that face whenever you are about to suggest something foolish."


She's sharp.
Her previous aura of loyalty is gone, and she keeps me at bay with a distrustful look.

"Well, there's something I forgot to tell you."
I kneel and face her.
...Well.
How can I phrase things so that she'll approve of me going to school?
"......"
"......"
I feel her staring at me, and it hurts.
Saber is sitting Japanese-style while I cut the tofu...
...Staring at me with that expression of hers.

'I will go to school like usual.'
We never reached a compromise after I said that.
Saber objected, of course.
She says it is dangerous for me to be alone.
But I have my personal life too.

Fuji-Nee will get suspicious if I skip school, and I won't know what's going on outside if I stay indoors.
And to go somewhere with Saber means warning other Masters.
I think the results will be good enough if I go out on my own. And most of all...

"Masters fight where there are no people, right? Then I'll be safe during the day. Nobody will attack me unless I go someplace deserted."
But Saber insisted that it's not going to be enough.
...Her excessive concern pissed me off, so I stubbornly insisted that I'm going to school, and this is the result.

"......"
Her glare feels like it's burning into me.

The moral of the story is...
She'll bear a big grudge if you make her mad. And she gets out of hand because she is emotional.
So I should be careful not to act stubborn again.

"...Man, you inflexible blockhead."
"Did you say something, Shirou?"
"No, I'm just talking to myself. This tofu's really tough."

...And she has sharp ears. She's not the type you want to get into a cold war with.

"Huh? It's that time already?"
After the doorbell, I hear the front door opening.
And I also hear the familiar tone of Sakura's voice.

"Oh, so I lost 30 minutes while I was arguing with Saber."

But breakfast is almost ready.
I thought about having bread to please Saber, but it seemed too much like bribery, so I changed my mind.
Japanese people eat rice.
I'll counter her violent glare with pressure of "when in Rome, do as the Romans do".

"Good morning, Senpai. Are you already done cooking?"
"Yeah, I'm pretty much done. Good morning, Sakura. Fuji-Nee should be coming soon, so help me serve the food."

"Okay! I'll be helping you."
Sakura sets her bag down in the living room and greets Saber.

"Good morning, Saber-san. Were you able to sleep well last night?"
"Yes. It was not a familiar room, but it was not a problem since I am familiar with this house."
...Oh, they're talking.
They didn't talk much yesterday, but I guess Sakura's gotten over it after one night.

"Sorry to keep you waiting, Senpai. What should I start with?"
"Can you get one big plate and four small ones? The salad's done, so you can serve it."

"Okay. Wow, we're having German potato salad this morning?
 You're elaborate this morning, cooking Western food."

Sakura is surprised, but she scoops out the salad onto the big plate.
The salad is the only Western food I made.
...You have to understand, I'm not giving in to Saber.  I'm just... proactively trying to clear the air between us.

"Oh, it smells good. Can I try some, Senpai?"
"Yeah, but it's hot. And it might be sweet, too."
"...?"
Sakura picks up a piece of potato with the cooking chopsticks.

"Hmm... Oh, it really is sweet. That's not... onion, is it?"
Licking her lips, Sakura tries to figure out the ingredients.


Her gesture surprises me.
I should be used to seeing Sakura sample my food, but when she's so close, I can't take my eyes off her.

"Wow, this is really good, Senpai! I like this taste!"
Sakura must really like it, as she happily scoops the salad onto the big plate.
There's nothing unusual about it.
The surprise fades, and I sigh with relief.

"Oh, hold on, Sakura."
"Yes? What is it, Senpai?"
She's the same as always.
She's no different from yesterday.
It should not concern Sakura even if Shinji was a Master or even if her family is a family of magi.

There's no way Sakura would be involved in the conflict.
There's no way, but...
"Sakura. Let me see your right cheek."
There's a bruise on her right cheek, as if she's been punched.

"Oh... it's not what you think, Senpai. I, um, fell on the stairs."

There's only one person who Sakura would make excuses for.
She's been like this for a long time.
She would be strangely lively or unnaturally depressed.

It always meant Shinji was taking things out on her.  When I first found out about it, I went and punched him.
...But he's never done something this bad before.
About half a year ago, I spotted a bruise on Sakura's arm.
I hit Shinji when I realized he'd done itbut he's never punched a girl's face!

"Damn him..."
"S-Senpai"
I hear a sharp crack.
It seems I broke the chopsticks in my hand.

"I'm pissed. I told him never to hit his sister again, but he couldn't keep such a simple promise...!?"

"No, Senpai. You've got it all wrong. I just fell, really. I fell when Nii-san bumped into me."
"Sakura."

"That's all that happened, Senpai.
 ...Please don't concern yourself with Nii-san right now.
 He's been acting weird since last night. He's really annoyed, so he might say odd things to you."


Sakura is defending her brother.
If the person who got hit isn't complaining, I definitely can't.

...And I know why Shinji's acting strange.
Shinji was abnormal last night.
His rights as a Master were taken away, and he was humiliated by his own grandfather.
He must have taken out his anger on Sakura after he went home.

"Kuh."
Sakura doesn't know anything.
Nobody's told her about her brother, or about the secret of the Matou family.
Thenis it safe for her to live with Shinji when he's in such a state?
He hasn't given up.
Sakura is a convenient outlet for his violent personality.

"...Um, Senpai? I'm sorry to trouble you so early in the day."
"You idiot. Don't say that."

I'm the one who caused the trouble.
I should've expected this when I fought Shinji last night.
I have to think of a way...
A way to keep Sakura smiling

A dismal air hangs over the rest of the morning.
Fuji-Nee didn't turn up for some reason, and Sakura was quiet all through breakfast.
Saber doesn't talk much to start with, and I'm not the garrulous type.
It doesn't take long to finish breakfast, so Sakura leaves 40 minutes early to go to her morning practice.

"...Um, I'll be going now, Senpai."
Sakura forces a smile as she puts on her shoes.

"Oh, don't push yourself too hard with your club activity. You always tried to go there even when you were sick, right? Just practice moderately and go sip some tea in the back. If Mitsuzuri says something, tell her I'll owe her one."

"Okay. I'm sure Captain would love that."
Sakura opens the door.
She bows and turns to leave
...And walks right into the door.

"S-Sakura!?"
"Oww."
She holds the nose she banged onto the door.

"A-Are you all right, Sakura!? Is your nose bleeding!?"
"No, I'm fine. I'd die if you saw my nose bleeding"
Sakura staggers and gets up.
...It doesn't seem like it was Sakura's usual clumsiness.

"...Are you really all right, Sakura? It looked like you fell. If you got dizzy, then..."
"Huh...? No, that can't be. I was just careless, so, um... this is embarrassing."
"......"

"Then I'll be going now. I'll tell Fujimura-Sensei that your breakfast was good, like always."
Sakura leaves, as if to shake off my worries.


I guess she's all right.
If anything, she's suffering from mental exhaustion.

"...And then there's Shinji. I can't just leave her be..."
But I have no clear solution.
I can't consult Saber, nor can I tell Sakura the truth. Fuji-Nee is out of the question, of course.


...Damn, if only there were someone else at school who I could talk to about the Holy Grail War
"...Man. People like that don't just conveniently appear out of nowhere..."
We run up the stone steps.
Saber is already armed.



We're both straining our nerves in preparation for an enemy attack.
The steps are long, and the wind is warm even though we're near the mountaintop.

According to Saber, this mountain has a boundary field that repels Servants.
Servants will lose most of their power and magical energy if they enter the mountain from anywhere other than the front gate.
Therefore, the only way we can enter is through the front gate, but...

"...I thought they would be setting up an ambush. Do you sense a Servant around here, Saber?"
"No.
 There are no other Servants around"
Saber suddenly stops and looks down.

"Saber...? Did you see something?"
"...No, it must be my imagination. I thought I saw a katana, but I cannot find it anywhere.
 The mountain gate is not guarded. Let us go inside the temple."

Saber starts running again.
"...?"
I tilt my head in wonder, but hurry to keep up with her.

...The compound is dead silent.
The wind is strong.
All around is thick darkness.
Despite the moon overhead, the terrible darkness remains.


I look up.
The moon is there, of course.
Its rays shine down on the compound.
But the area is still shrouded in darkness.

"Saber."
"Yes, something is wrong.  No one would let us come this far without offering resistance. Andthis place is too quiet."
"...Let's go inside. The Ryudou Temple has close to fifty people living in it.
 It can't be this quiet."

We head for the temple.
There's no one around.
After confirming that the compound is empty, we go inside.

Everyone in the temple is sleeping.
They do not even twitch.
They don't react even when we touch them.
All the monks, without exception, are weakened.
No matter how hard we try to rouse them, they just lie there, breathing peacefully as if enjoying a dream.

Of course, my classmate is among them.
Ryudou Issei is sleeping peacefully as well.


We quickly move across the wooden hallway.
...It's because Saber felt a presence.
Saber pointed toward the main temple building.
The Master responsible for this disaster is there.

We step into the shrine.
The first thing we see is the red blood spreading on the floor.

"...!?"
A red flower blooms in the center of the temple.
There is a man lying there as well.
His chest must be pierced, as the man is dyeing the floor red.

The wound is fatal, and the man has lost enough blood to die.
He's already a corpse.
I know this man, and it seems he was Master to the one standing beside his body.

The Servant is looking down at her Master with a mysterious dagger in hand.
"......!"
Pain lances through my head, accompanied by a sense of apprehension.
It's not that I'm scared of this scene.

That
That dagger is ominous.
It seems Saber does not feel anything, but I can tell that the dagger has dreadful power.

"Caster...!"
Saber readies herself.
The Servant in a purple robe, Caster, does not answer.
I don't know if Saber took it as an opening or as an insult...
But she tries to charge

"No, hold on, Saber...!"
"Shirou...!? Why are you stopping me? This is our best chance to defeat Cast"

"No, just don't go near that dagger...! That thing can break contracts. It might even cut the bond between a Servant and a Master."
"ThenCaster killed her own Master?"

"......"
I don't know if she did.
But I'm sure the dagger she's holding has unearthly power.

"Casteryou killed your own master...!!"
Saber rushes in with an angry roar.
...Caster turns around.
With her vigor gone, she looks more like a ghost than a heroic spirit.

The sword flashes through the air.
It slices the robe, but Caster manages to jump back.

"Saber...?
 I see.  You must have come to finish me off. I don't know whose plot this is, but he is quite thorough."

"Silence. I do not want anything from a person who betrayed her master. Regret your actions and take your punishment."
"HahI killed my Master? I killed Souichirou-sama?
 Fuhhaha, ahahahahaha! That is funny! Perhaps I should have done so, if it was going to turn out like this...!"

She starts laughing maniacally.
The black-robed magus puts her dagger away and points at Saber.

"You're an eyesore, Saber. Disappear along with your Master."

Saber does not even need to answer.
She raises her sword without hesitation.

...Caster disappears.
The battle between the two could not be called a battle.

Caster's magic was supreme, but it did no good against Saber, who has high magic resistance.
Saber nullified every magic Caster used and killed her in one blow.

"I have defeated Caster. Please give me your order, Master."
"Eh? O-Oh. ...Well, we can't do anything here. Let's contact the hospital... no, Kotomine first. We should be able to save the people here that way."

...But we can't save the corpse in front of us.
Caster has disappeared, leaving only her Master's corpse at our feet.
...His death will likely be kept a secret.
Nobody will know what happened to him, and he will disappear from everyone's memory.

"Shirou."
"...I know. There are still four more Masters. We have no time to waste."
"That is a wise decision. I understand your feelings, but this is not the time for sentiment."

Saber turns and starts to walk.

Engraving the sight of the corpse into my mind, I follow.

"Huh?"
Wait...
What was that...?

"Shirou? Why did you stop?"
"Eh... um. I felt someone's gaze on me, like we're being watched. Didn't you feel it?"

"No, I did not feel anything. We have already determined that there is nobody here. Is it not your imagination?"
"Uh... maybe. If you put it that way, I guess that's right. Yeah, it must be just me."

"Then let us hurry. The people should wake up now that Caster is dead. It would be troublesome if somebody saw us here."

...She's right.
Tonight will leave a bad taste in my mouth, but it should put an end to the mysterious coma incidents.
That should be good enough for tonight.

"All right. Let's get out of here and contact Kotomine, then go home and rest."
Saber nods in satisfaction and leaves the temple.


I follow after Saber, even though it's really hard for me to leave this place.
...The man who used to be a Master lies silently in this holy place.
The lead actor has left.
The only ones remaining on the stage are silent corpses.
And...
...Something is devouring the corpses.
No bodies remain.
The wooden floor turns into a bottomless swamp, swallowing up the man's flesh and spilled blood.

It consumes not only the man, but the one who obeyed him.
The soul that was Servant Caster is swallowed into the darkness.
It is not a legitimate flow.
The defeated Servants are to be consumed by the Holy Grail.
If anyone interferes with this balance, it will only bring his own death and destruction.


It cries silently.
It writhes in pain, sobs, exposes itself, and finally consumes the first one.

IT IS NOT ENOUGH

It walks on.
Lacking a voice, it expresses its pain with the whole of its body.

IT IS NOT ENOUGH

There are no words, nor emotion.
It never had those functions in the first place.

IT IS NOT ENOUGH

But it still grieves.
As if...
...It has become aware of its existence for the first time.

It's hot.

Why did it happen?
I went to bed, closed my eyes, and said good night... but in the next instant, my world turned red.

It's hot.

My mom woke me up before the loud noises did.
It was bright even though it was night-time.
My dad held me as he ran through the burning hallway.

It's painful.

I heard my mom's voice behind us.
My dad told me I should be fine by myself.
He patted my head and told me to wait here.
I nodded and did as I was told.

It hurts.

It wasn't much different outside.
My eyes were hurting because everything was red.
That's why I closed them and ran. I wanted to go to a place that wasn't hot.
When I looked back, my house was no longer there.
I probably got punished because I didn't do as I was told to.

My eyes hurt.

I cried as I walked.
I had to go back to my house and wait.
But I didn't know where my house was anymore.
I raised my head which I'd kept hidden with my hands until now.

AndI finally confronted the scene.

The town was burning far away.
The fire that cannot be put out was an event that cannot be redone.
It happened ten years ago.
The fire was far away, not in the sense of distance, but in the sense of time.

"Ahh, guh"
My skin was hurting.
My throat hurt when I breathed in.
My skin creaked by staying alive.
I moved my legs wanting to escape, but something heavy entangled around my legs like shackles.
I knew that it's the presence of death wanting to take me.

"Huh?"
...But it sure was hot.
My nails tearing my throat were discolored.
The air I breathed in stung my burned esophagus.
My eyes abandoned their function, and my brain was being steamed inside my skull.

"Why?"
It's hot.
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot it's hot it's hot it's hot it's hot it's hot it's hot it's hot......!!!!

"Haaa."
I remember now.
This place was hotreally hot.
But it was colddreadfully cold.

It passed the boiling point to reach the freezing point.
The burning blood froze up, and everything in my view was inverted.
Everything was hot.
That's why it was cold.
And still, it was ridiculously hot.

    ...But.
    What was the cause of it?


A black sun was in the sky.
I didn't find it strange that the sun was up during night or that the sun was black.
After all, everything was inverted.
So such things should have been normal.

"AhAhh......!"
But I ran away.
I got scared and ran away.
I wasn't afraid of the raging fires.
Compared to that black shadow, burning up and dying seemed like a human death.
That's why I ran away.
I knew I'd be taken someplace even worse if that thing caught me.

I blankly stared at the sky.
I found out that it was going to rain soon, and my outstretched hand slowly fell to the ground

"Agh."
I slowly open my eyes.
I look around my room, my mind still asleep.

"It was a dream."
I sigh with relief in my futon.
How many years has it been since I sighed with relief after seeing a nightmare?

"...But... that was a vivid dream."
My temples feel hot.
I used to have this nightmare all the time.

...It all happened ten years ago.
Back then, my memories of the event were still terribly vivid, and I would wander through the fire every time I fell asleep.
I thought I would never be able to forget about that day.
That sky, the smell of the burning air, the surrounding wall of fire... Everything was real again once I fell asleep.


That doesn't change even now.
But the vividness should change.
Wounds heal, and memories fade.
For the past few years, all I saw when I had that dream was a field of red.
Why did my dream contain as far as the smell of the burning air?


And what was that?
I don't remember such a thing, nor do I recognize it.
No, first of all, I did not see such a thing.

"!"
...I feel sick to my stomach.
I get dizzy when I try to think about it.
The breaker in my body trips, telling me not to think about it.

"I'll get up. I'll wash my face and clear my mind."
My body is sweaty, probably because of the dream.
My pajamas are damp with my sweat, and my head feels light.

"Huh...?"
...My arm feels heavy.
I realize that I don't even have the strength to get up.

"Heywhat's going on?"
Damn, even talking takes effort.
When I place my hand on my forehead, I realize that it's hot.

"...Wow. Did I catch a cold...?"
I'm surprised.
This is the first time I've caught a cold.
I've had bruises pretty often, but I've never caught a cold.

"...That must be why I had such a dream. My body was hot, so the dream was hot as well."

Oh, that makes sense.
My head is blank, so it's natural for me to dream such a
"Oh."
W-W-W-W-Wait, what am I just lying around for!!!???

"Why!? How can this be!?"
I jump up.
I check inside my futon.
This isn't the time to worry about little things like being sick.
I have to check something far more important.

If "it" happened, I have to go take a bath, bleach and dry the evidence, or it'll hinder my future ability to have a say in anything.
To put it simply, the value of the Emiya Shirou stock in this house will plummet.

"Wait. It doesn't seem like it."
...Good.
There's no one in my futon with me, and there's nothing wrong with my body.

"...It was a dream. Yeah, it had to be."
...I didn't go to school in my sleep, nor would Tohsaka ever want to... um... do it with me.
So it had to be a dream.
I have my pajamas on, and Saber was sleeping in the room next to mine!

"...Yeah. There's no way Saber would miss me leaving the house."
I sigh with relief.
The strength floods out of me, and I fall back to the futon.

"Shirou...? What was that sound?"
I hear Saber's voice from the other side of the door.
...See?
That's all it takes to alert Saber, so that had to be a dream. It's a dream. It's soooooo a dream. I'll never be able to look Tohsaka in the eye again if it's not.

"Shirou?"
Saber comes in.
"Y-Yo. Good morning, Saber."
I try to act calm.

"What is wrong, Shirou? It is not like you to greet me lying down."
"Well, something unexpected happened."

Saber tilts her head in wonder.
Well.
It's great that the whole event was just a dream, but the troubles keep coming.
My body feels heavy, and I can't stand up. How will I make breakfast?

"37.6 degrees. Wow, it's rare for you to catch a cold."
She gives me her diagnosis after looking at the medical thermometer.
...Well, that's about what I expected, but I didn't know a cold could make your body feel so heavy.

"So, does it hurt anywhere else? Does your throat or head hurt?"
"...? No, nothing like that. It's just that my body feels heavy and hot. Is that weird?"

"Hmm... I guess we should just be glad that nothing's hurting.
 Then again, you might not have noticed the pain because you're the type who just deals with it. ...I'll have some other medicines ready, just in case."

Fuji-Nee takes out some cold medicine and cough drops from the first-aid kit.
She's good at treating wounds, but I guess she's not used to treating sick people.

"Thanks, Fuji-Nee. And I'm sorry. I don't think I can cook breakfast."
"Don't say such a stupid thing. Which do you think is more important, food or Shirou? It's good Saber-chan came and got me. I would've been really mad if you tried to make breakfast like that."

She really is mad.
...And she's right. That should have been obvious.

"And you don't have to worry about food. Sakura-chan made some rice porridge for you, so you can eat that when you get hungry."
"What...? Sakura made some rice porridge...?"
...That must mean she's feeling better.

"Are you all right, Sakura? You seemed to be doing worse than me."
"You don't need to worry since I've recovered.
 I wasn't scared at all at night, and I got a good night's sleep. It's all thanks to your treatment."

...That's good to know.
I thought she would take longer to get over the cold, but I'm glad she recovered in one night.

"Ohhh, I forgot about that. Sakura-chan was the one with the cold yesterday, wasn't she?"
"Huh...? That's true... but what about it? Stop making that face."

"Ohhhh. So you did something that made you catch her cold?"
"Huh? What do you mean by that?"
"Oh, you don't get it? Sakura-chan's recovered, right? Then you must've done something. I hear that you recover from a cold if you give it to someone else."

"...?"
I look at Sakura in confusion.
"Oh."
And I finally understand what Fuji-Nee is talking about.

"A-A-A-A-A-A-Are you stupid!? I just gave her some medicine yesterday...! Don't even joke about it, Fuji-Nee! That's rude to Sakura...!"
I can tell that my face is getting red.
My temperature shoots up another degree.

"I'm kidding. I know you're not man enough for that."
"...That's offending as well, but I'm glad the misunderstanding has been cleared up."

"Good, good. Then I'll report to the school about your absence, so you're to rest today. Please take care of Shirou, Saber-chan.
 He'll keep trying to do something if you let him be, so you'd better just tie him to the futon."

"That is my intention. I am to look over him so that he does not escape, and feed him appropriately?"
"Wow, that's a scary way to put it, but you have the right idea. Please do."

Saber nods silently.
...Is it just me, or did I feel a chill run up my spine?

"Well, just listen to what Saber-chan tells you until we get home. I'll buy you something nutritious for dinner, so you're going to rest today and cure that cold of yours."

Fuji-Nee smiles at me while making unreasonable demands.
"...?"
I notice Sakura behind her, looking like she wants to say something.

"We're leaving. Look forward to my souvenir!"
Fuji-Nee waves goodbye and leaves.

"......Phew."
Once I've seen her off, I return to my futon.
I only walked out to the porch, but by the time I get back, I'm so tired that I practically collapse into bed.
...I don't have a bad cold, but my body is dead tired.
I should sleep and get my energy back, or else I won't be able to do anything.

Then.
Even though it's past 7:30, Sakura comes to my room.

"Sakura? It's 7:30 already. You won't make it unless you leave soon."

"......"
Sakura looks down awkwardly.
When I realize she has the same expression as before...

"Um, Senpai. Can I stay here?"
...She raises her head and asks me a question.

"...?"
Staying here means she's not going to school, right?

"...Oh. Are you still a bit sick?"
"......No, the fever's gone. But, um..."
Sakura's words trail off.
...Hm.
She does look a bit pale, and it seems impossible that she could recover in only one night.

"I see, so you were sick after all. But is it all right?
 Don't you have to call the school and let them know?"
"...No. Um, I'm thinking of skipping."
"...?"
She's going to be skipping... school?

"Why? You're sick, so you're not skipping school. You have to stay home if you're not feeling well."

"...Uh. Um, I feel fine."
Sakura hangs her head even more.
"...???"
I don't get it.
What does Sakura want to tell me?

"U-Um. I think you caught the cold because of me."
"What? You actually believe Fuji-Nee's ridiculous story?  Don't worry, it's not true. I take walks during the night, so that must've been it."

"I-I still don't care. ...I'm feeling well, so I want to skip school and take care of you to show my appreciation for what you did for me yesterday...!"
She's so tense that she might shatter if I poke her.

"Hmm."
I guess Sakura feels responsible for my cold.

To be honest, it's relieving to have Sakura here.
Saber has to sleep, so it'll be a big help if she can prepare my medicine and stuff.

"Um, Senpai...?"
"Okay, please do, Sakura."
"Y-You're right. Saber-san is here, so there's nothing I can do here
 Huh, Senpai?"
"Yeah. Please take care of me, Sakura."

"UmYou're talking about me, right?"
"Yeah. Saber has jetlag, so she sleeps during the day. It'll be a huge help if you can cook lunch."
"O-Okay!
 I-I'll do my best, Senpai!"

Her tension gone, Sakura replies with a smile.
...Yeah.
A smile like this suits Sakura.
It's 11AM now.
After eating the rice porridge Sakura made, I feel much better.
My body doesn't feel heavy anymore.
I have no trouble moving, so I should be able to go to school if I feel like it.

But.
As soon as I try to get up, suspecting that my illness was simply caused by malnutrition...

"Oh, no, Senpai! You have to rest until your fever goes away."
...Sakura comes to check up on me.

"Phew."
So...
I'm still resting because Sakura is dead set on looking after me, and to be honest, I'm still feeling a bit sluggish.

After bringing me the rice porridge, Sakura left the room, saying that she had something to do.
Saber is resting in the living room right now.
She was keeping watch in this room, but I had her move to the living room so that I could have a little peace of mind.
She objected, but then relented when I told her it'd only be for today.

"Excuse me, Senpai. How do you feel?"
"I'm getting better thanks to you. My body still feels heavy, but my fever's gone."

"That's good. Then you won't need to take any medicine. All you have to do now is to eat good food and rest."
Sakura goes into the next room and brings in a new futon.

"...? What are you doing, Sakura?"
"I'm getting a new futon. You've been sweating all day, so I thought you might want a clean one."

She lays the futon next to me in a skillful manner.
It doesn't stir up any dust, to my surprise.

"It's ready, Senpai. Please move over here. ...Oh, you need to change before that. I'll go dry this futon, so please get changed while I'm gone."
Sakura prepares new pajamas for me in a flash.


S-She's perfect!
It's not just that she's good at this or that she's attentive.

"I bet this skill is in her genes.  It has to be."
"...? Did you say something, Senpai?"
"I did. I know I shouldn't be saying this, but I'm glad you skipped school today.
 I really do have a better opinion of you now."

"That's natural. It's been almost a year and a half since I started coming here, so I know all about your house."
Sakura puffs with pride.
Her confident expression makes me smile.

"I see. Then I'll leave the futon to you. I'll act as a sick person and do as you say."
"Please do. I'm going to go cut some apples for you after I dry the futon, so look forward to it."
Carrying the futon I've been laying on, Sakura goes out into the hallway.

"Wow, she took all of it in one load."
Her enthusiasm surprises me, and I pick up the new pajamas.

Well.
I should towel myself off, change, and wait in the futon until Sakura comes back.

How much time passed?
Sakura brought me some apples as promised, I gladly ate them, and...
"Geez. You can't push yourself, Senpai."
...Sakura scolded me, and I have to keep lying here even though I'm recovered.

"So, did Saber help?"
"Yes. She said she was tired of doing nothing, so she helped me clean the guest rooms."
"I see. I kind of wanted to see Saber wring a floor cloth.
 Did you two clean the hallway?"

"Yes. We both worked hard. Saber-san was saying something about how it was useful, though."
Sakura laughs, as if she's a bit troubled.
Even though she's used to Saber now, it seems she's still not entirely comfortable around her.

"...Well, thanks for your hard work. But don't push yourself too hard, okay? You just got over a cold. It's hard enough just to treat me, so you don't have to go around cleaning my house."
"That's not true. I spend my mornings here, and you always treat me to dinner. It's perfectly natural for me to clean this house, because..."

I'm part of this family.
Sakura murmurs, as if she wishes for it to come true.

"You're right. Fuji-Nee, Sakura, and I are like a family."
"Eh... Senpai?"

"I'm sorry I was so reserved. There's nothing wrong with a family member nursing me back to health.
 I'd do the same for you if you got sick, no matter how much you complained.
 So it was stupid of me to be reserved."
Reflecting on my actions, I can only apologize.


The conversation stops.
After gasping for a brief second...

"Yes. I'm glad you understand. I think you treasure others too much."
...Sakura smiles happily and adjusts my blanket.


That makes me realize.
Why this house is always clean...
Why even the unused rooms are maintained and feel lively...

Sakura. My friend's younger sister.
The girl I've come to know so well has protected my house even more than me.
Every day has been peaceful for the past year and a half.
...I probably didn't notice because it felt so natural.
But Sakura brought something that Fuji-Nee and I couldn't achieve by ourselves.


I look up at Sakura absent-mindedly.
...Is it because of my fever, or because Sakura's so happy to take care of me?
Looking at Sakura's smile warms my heart and makes me drowsy.

"Hm......"
I really am sleepy.
...It feels good, so I should close my eyes and sleep until noon...

"But Senpai. I really like that part of you."

"What?"
Whatever she just said, it made my heart jump.

"S-Sakura?"
"S-Senpai...!?
 W-Were you awake...!?"
Sakura quickly jumps back.
I can feel myself blushing at her surprised reaction.

"Uh, um, Sakura..."
"I-I didn't say anything! I didn't say anything! Um, I was looking at your face because... um... yes! I was trying to take your temperature!"
Sakura takes out the medical thermometer in a hurry.

"Senpai, here's the thermometer! I'm going to take your temperature, so please open your mouth!"
She must be in a panic, as she tries to pin me with one hand while holding the thermometer in the other.

"Huh?"
I feel something soft.
...Um, I think it's Sakura's breasts rubbing against me.


My brain boils up.
The sensation of a woman almost blows away my sanity.

"Whoa!
 H-Hold on, Sakura!!!"
"Kya!?"
I roll out of the futon using all my might.
I have to get away from Sakura's breano, from Sakura!

"S-Senpai...? Um, I want to take your temperature."
"I-It's fine! I can do that myself, so you stop right there!"

"...? If you say so.
 Here's the thermometer, Senpai."

"No!!!
 Don't give it to me now! Please let me calm down! I'll recall last night's dream and die if you come near me right now!"
I can feel my face burning as I protest.

Then.
"Yesterday's dream?"
I must have acted really strange, as Sakura looks at me dubiously.

"Uhh... um. I had a bad dream.
 I don't want to recall it right now, so please leave me alone. It's not your fault, okay? It's just that I need more training."

"You need... more training...?"
Sakura gapes at me.
...It's only natural. Anyone would be stunned in this situation.

"Um, Senpai. What kind of a dream was it?"
"Ugh"
I-I can't tell her about such a dream...!

"I-It wasn't a big deal. It was just a bit disturbing."
"Senpai."
...Ugh. She's serious now, probably because she's worried about me.
...I can't lie to her, but I can't tell her the truth either.
I
"I'm home."
"Where were you, Shirou!?"
"Where did you go, Senpai!?"
"W-Whoa!?"
I jump back, bumping against the front door.

"No, not 'whoa'! I have told you many times not to go outside by yourself! Worse still, you snuck out while you were sick...!"

"Saber-san's right!
 You wrote that you'd be back at two! Do you know what time it is!? Where were you for the extra two hours!?"

"Uhno, hold on. I understand. I understand why you two are mad, so..."
If you guys will just calm down, I should be able to come up with an excuse...

"No, you do not understand...! I agreed with your decision to go to school yesterday, but I cannot forgive you this time. It seems you are healthy enough. I shall train you until dinner!"
Saber pushes Sakura aside and steps closer.

"Yes, the dojo is cleaned, so please have some matches with Saber-san! I heard how good she is from Fujimura-Sensei, so I'm sure you'll enjoy it!"
Sakura pushes Saber aside and roars at me.

"Uhugh."
...I can't do this. I'll only add fuel to the fire if I say the wrong thing. Saber might even go as far as breaking our contract.
"Where is your reply, Shirou!?"
"Where's your reply, Senpai!?"
"Uh... I'm sorry."
Rattle, rattle.
I hate my front door for blocking my retreat.

"Then let us go at once. Please prepare the first-aid kit, Sakura."
"Please do. Punish him all you want."
The two retreat together in unison.

".........Man. I wonder if I'll be able to eat dinner tonight."
But I don't know what they'll do if I don't go with them.
...I guess I have to atone for my actions in the dojo...
...I guess it can't be helped.
I'll tell her the facts without giving away too much.

"Who was in your dream, Senpai?"
"...Well, um. It was only Tohsaka."
I confess.

"I see. Tohsaka-Senpai came here the other day too, right?"
"Oh... yeah. She treated my wound, but went home right away."

"...Okay. Then I'll be leaving the thermometer here."
Sakura sets the thermometer down and walks to the door with heavy steps.

"Excuse me, but I need to go cook lunch. I'll come get you when it's ready, so rest until then."
She slides the shouji closed behind her.
Her retreating footsteps sound colder than usual.
There's a time and place for honesty.
It burns my face just thinking about the dream, so I'd probably collapse from fever if I actually talk about it.

"Who was in your dream, Senpai?"
"No one was in my dream! See, you forget about your dreams once you wake up, so I don't remember all of it."

"Really? Then I just want to know what you remember about it."

"You idiot...!"
I don't know when Sakura came close to me, but she draws near me.

"I-I'm telling you not to come near me right now!!!! I'm sorry! This subject is off limits, off limits, off limits!"
I wave my hand and roll further down the tatami.

Damn, I really do need more training.
I can usually ignore them, but now every move Sakura makes is catching my attention because of the dream I had...!

"P-Please just leave me alone for a while. D-Don't you have to obey a sick person's requests!?"
Sitting in the corner of the room, I protest to Sakura.

"......Phew. All right, I won't force it out of you.
 I do want to know about it, but your fever might get worse if I push you."
Sakura backs down.

"I'm sorry. I'm glad you understand how I feel."
I quickly climb back into my futon.

"Well, Senpai. I need to go cook lunch, so please excuse me.
 I'll come get you when it's done, so please rest until then."
"Oh, okay. You do that."

"Sure. I'm sorry I asked you a weird question. I'll make some hot udon for lunch."
She closes the shouji.
Sakura leaves for the living room with a warm smile.
"Thanks for the meal."
"Thanks for the meal."
We bow together.
"You're welcome. Wow, you both ate everything in your bowls."

Sakura starts to clean up after our lunch.
There are three bowls and condiments on the table.

"Oh, I'll clean up. I'm feeling better, so please, at least let me do this."
"Really? Then please do, as a test to see if you've recovered. I'll do the dishes, so please take the dishes to the kitchen and clean the table."

Tying on an apron, Sakura heads to the kitchen.
Well, I should carry these bowls and the pot in there.

"Are you all right, Shirou? I heard that your fever has broken, but you still look pale."
"Huh? Do I look that bad?"

"...Hm. No, your face just looks pale.
 You have a shortage of magical energy, the lifeline for a magus. I noticed no problems during the battle last night, but that temple might have been set up to drain magical energy."

"Hmm."
...Now that she mentions it, something was indeed strange at the Ryudou Temple.
Everyone in there was weakened.  It's possible that Caster set up a boundary field to suck the lifeforce from anyone inside.

"Well, I'm feeling better, so there's no problem. My magical energy should return if I get some nourishment. My capacity isn't that large, so it should be back to normal once I eat dinner."

"Geez. I will not inquire any further if you say so. ...Sakura is right. It seems you tend to make light of yourself."
Saber starts stacking the bowls.

"I should hand these to Sakura, correct? I will take the pot as well, so please wipe the table, Shirou."
Saber goes to the kitchen without waiting for my reply.

"Should I put the bowls here, Sakura?"
"Saber-san? Oh, yes. Please put the dirty dishes there."
"I see. By the way, Sakura, lunch was very delicious. Please accept my thanks."
"Ahaha, I have a lot to learn. Senpai's still the best when it comes to rice porridge and udon."

"......"
I can hear friendly conversation from the kitchen.
"Oh. So Sakura is getting along with Saber."
Maybe it's because they helped each other clean this morning.
Either way, it's a good thing that they're getting along.

"Well, I should prepare some tea."
I place the tea leaves and the teapot on the table.

It's almost one o'clock.
It's a good time to take a break, so
"Oh, right."
There should be some dorayaki, bean-jam pancakes, that I bought on a whim.
In my efforts to keep Fuji-Nee from finding them, I hid them so well that I forgot about them myself.

"Senpai? What are you doing, opening the refrigerator?"
"Well, I'm thinking of repaying you just a bit."

I look in the very back, behind all the vegetables.
Thanks to years of practice in hiding things from Fuji-Nee, I hide snacks where I can find them before they pass the expiration date.

"...Huh? Why is there an Edomaeya bag in the vegetable compartment?"
Sakura stares at the bag with surprise and expectation.

By the way, Edomaeya is a stand that sells dorayaki, taiyaki, and takoyaki.
The students at my school love this place because of its low prices and huge servings.
And to add, Sakura really loves the food there.

"T-There's a lot in there. I thought you had potatoes in there."

"That's how I camouflaged it. I figured I'd forget about it, so I put it where it'd be found when we ran out of carrots."
I take out the time-bomb guarding against Fuji-Nee.

"So let's eat these as refreshments. Oh, or should we make this a mid-afternoon snack?
 We just ate, so you two must be full."
I put the paper bag onto the tray so I won't forget about it.

"Huh...? A-Are you full, Senpai?"
"I am. Lunch was really good, so I ate about two meals worth. I think I won't get hungry for a while."

"I-I thought so too!
 T-Then let's save the fun for later and"
"Are you saving them for later? I am still hungry."

"Oh. Wow, you've got room for more? That's amazing, considering that you ate as much as Sakura."
"I am more interested in the food. Sugar is a source of energy, and I have never heard of 'dorayaki' before."

...I see.
A Japanese snack like this must be foreign to Saber, who is from a Western culture.

"Fair enough. Then here's some for dessert. There's more than enough for you, so we can keep the leftovers for a snack this afternoon."
"OhSenpai. Pardon me for asking, but how many did you buy...?"

"Hm? I think I bought five. Each of us gets one, and the remaining two can be shared or given to anyone who wants them."

"I see. According to that calculation, I can eat a maximum of three?"
"Yeah. But you'll get heartburn if you eat so many sweets. ...Well, I guess you can handle three."

I return to the living room with the tray.
To thank the two girls for doing the dishes, I prepare the dorayaki along with some tea.

"We are done. So that is dorayaki, Shirou?"
"Huh?"
Then.
Saber is sitting there and staring at the tray, apparently ready to eat.

Sakura quietly sits down beside her.

"Sakura? Is something wrong?"
"No, nothing's wrong. I'm full, just like you."
"...?"
I don't understand, but I go ahead and pour some tea for the three of us.

"Itadakimasu."
She bows and reaches for the dorayaki.
The match is over in an instant.
After taking the tentative first bite, Saber quickly digs in with more enthusiasm.
Undeterred by its sweetness, she quickly finishes her first dorayaki.

"I see. It is a simple dessert, but it goes well with the tea."
She takes an elegant sip of tea and reaches for the second dorayaki.
Sakura watches nervously.

"......"
...Hold on.
Is Sakura uneasy because...?
"Hm. This is certainly more than just dessert."
Saber quickly finishes her second one and reaches out for the third.

"Hold on, Saber. Can you stop at two?"
"...? I do not mind, since I was only going to eat the excess share. Are you going to eat the rest, Shirou?"

"Sakura and I will eat them. I'll eat one, Sakura will eat one, and the last one..."
I take the third dorayaki and break it in half.
"...Sakura and I will share it. You can handle this, right?"
"Y-Yes, of course! I can eat it right now!"

As I thought.
Sakura was reserved for some reason.
Nobody would mind if she ate one or two dorayaki.

"Well, let's eat too. I got hungry watching Saber."
"I-I agree! I can eat this easily!"

Sakura reaches out for the dorayaki.
Although not as much as taiyaki, Sakura loves dorayaki.

".........But..."
I'm glad she likes the food I bought. But...
I hope she doesn't regret it in front of the scale later on...

My body is almost fully healed by the time we finish eating.
The fever probably came from fatigue, so half a day's rest did the trick.

"So, will you be using the afternoon to train?"
I nod back.

Even though I only just recovered, we can't waste any time.
Skill in magic doesn't improve after one day of training, but physical skill should be different.
It won't hurt to train until dinner.
I should laze around after a meal.
Your body needs to use its energy for digestion, and besides, tea tastes good after a meal.
I know it's shameful to leave the two of them to do the dishes, but they have a good atmosphere going in the kitchen.

Since they have no common interests to talk about, they are doing the dishes together as a way of bonding.

"Wow, they're getting along well."
I leisurely watch what's going on in the kitchen.
There's some program for housewives on TV.
In this peaceful atmosphere, I fully enjoy a short rest after our meal.

My body is almost fully healed by the time I finish resting.
The fever was probably the result of fatigue, so even half a day's rest did the trick.

"So, will you be using the afternoon to train?"
I nod back.

Even though I just recovered, we can't waste any time.
Magical skill doesn't improve after only one day, but physical skill should be different.
It won't hurt to train until dinner.
"Oh yeah"
I forgot about it because of all the things that happened this morning, but I did make a promise with Ilya.
...Well, it wasn't really a promise, but I'd be really dishonest if I don't go, as I'm the one who asked her if we could see each other again.

"Saber and Sakura are..."
They're doing the dishes together.
If I tell them I'm going out, they'll either stop me or insist on coming along.

If I'm going to go see Ilya, I should do it alone.
I feel bad, but I'll just leave a note and sneak out

"Phew."
I managed to sneak out.
I left them a note saying, "Going to buy stuff for dinner. Be back in an hour," so they shouldn't be too worried.

"Hm... So she's not here, as I thought."
There's no one in the park.
Even with the apartments looming overhead, this place is so cold that it feels like it'll start snowing at any moment.

"...Well, I don't know what I'd talk about even if she were here."
I sit on the bench.
Setting the grocery bag down, I look up at the dark sky.
...It seems the gift I bought at the shopping district went to waste.


I stare at the sky absent-mindedly.
It must be because this place is surrounded by buildings.
Only a tiny square of sky is visible, and it seems farther away than usual.

"It's cold."
I can see my breath.
The cold, dry air is freezing, and I wouldn't be surprised even if it started snowing.

"Well, I should go home."
I grab the grocery bag and get up.
It's past two o'clock.
I have to leave now if I'm going to be home in time.

"Huh?"
My legs freeze.
They won't move.
They don't even budge, no matter how hard I try


My vision blurs.
No, that's an understatement.
My vision is broken.
My eyes have bulged into my skull, and I have no sense of distance.

"Ah"
I realize that I'm in the worst situation possible.
It feels like my body has been turned into stone.
My nerves are disconnected, leaving me detached from the world.
It's like I'm watching the world through a camera, controlling myself in a video game.

"Sa... ber"
I'll be killed.
It was a mistake to go outside alone.

I can't even see my attacker's face, let alone move, and
"Did I surprise you?
 You were completely defenseless, so I had to tease you."
Um, I'm being teased by this mischievous girl?

"Oh, you're back to normal. I guess contacting you through vision isn't that strong."
"Il"

She appears from behind me.
She's smiling, probably because she was already here and was watching me from behind.

"But you're no good if you can't dispel magic using your own powers. Your future looks gloomy if outside factors are the only things that can dispel you."
She lectures me.
But her words aren't coming into my brain.

"Ilya! What are you doing!? Surprise attacks are unfair, even if we're both Masters!"

"Hey, that wasn't a surprise attack. I was sitting next to you for a while. But you didn't notice me, and then you made it worse by getting ready to leave. That was your own fault, Shirou."
"...!? Y-You were sitting next to me this whole time?"

"Yeah, I was hiding a bit. But you're too careless. You didn't notice my presence, and you were captivated by a spell that merely uses direct magical energy contact. You're a Master, so you should keep a better watch on your surroundings."
Ilya warns me, utterly amazed.

"Ohyeah. You're right."
She seems so much like a teacher that I find myself nodding.

"It's good if you understand.
 So, what's going on today? You're empty inside right now, but you don't have Saber with you. If you're trying to rest, wouldn't it be safer to do it at home?"

"Huh? Well, I didn't come here to rest.
 Well, you're right that not bringing Saber was careless of me."

"Right? I couldn't leave you alone because you seemed so odd. I wasn't supposed to talk to you after yesterday, but I'll make an exception for today."
"...?"
Ilya's saying something strange.
After all, I came to this park because...

"So, why were you just sitting here?
 You would've been dead if I came here as a Master."
"Well, I just came here to see you.
 You told me yesterday that we could meet again."

"What?"
Oh, she's surprised.
...Well, it's not like it was an official promise.

"Why...? You came to see me, even though I told you I'll be trying to kill you?"
"That's your choice. It's not mine. I just want to talk to you, not fight. And in any case"

Ilya said she'd kill me, but she just let a chance go by.
She could've really done it if she'd kept her spell on me.
As she didn't do so, I don't want to fight her.

"Masters don't fight during daytime, right?
 Then let's forget about it for now. I just came here to see you. Do you want to kill me more than you want to talk with me?"

"Eh? T-That's an unfair question. I have to do both. It's fun to talk with you, but I can't forgive you. So I can't choose just one."

Ilya hangs her head and mumbles.
She looks serious, like she's actually suffering rather than just being troubled.

"...I see. Then I don't care. I won't ask you to choose one."
"Oh... B-But I..."
"I know. But since we're both here, let's talk.
 I brought a gift for you today, so we'll fight some other time."

I take out a bag of taiyaki.
They cooled off while I was waiting for Ilya, but they're still a bit warm.

"Here's the offering. I'll give you these, so please let me go this time."
I hold out the taiyaki.
"Oh"
Ilya hesitates, but then takes them and nods.

I'm not too sure what we talked about after that.
We talked about meaningless things:
What she likes to eat, what she doesn't like to eat, how she likes birds and hates cats, how she likes snow and hates the cold, how she wants to play but can't, and how she doesn't like her maids but wants to like them.

Ilya looks happy just to be talking.
She is sitting on the bench, eating the taiyaki, and swinging her legs.
...She looks like a child waiting for her father's return.

"I see. So you didn't come to this town by yourself?"
"No, I came with Sella and Leysritt. I don't need people to keep an eye on me, but I do need people to take care of my place, right?"

...So Ilya came to Japan with two maids.
Are they staying at a hotel or something?

"What? Are you curious? Do you want to know where I live?"
"Eh... yeah, I'm curious. You keep popping up at unexpected times, but what would I do if an emergency happens and I don't know where you live?"

Even if she gets injured and asks me for help, I won't be able to if I don't know that.
I'll rest a little easier if I know where she lives

"All right. You're special. If you want to know that badly, I'll tell you."
Then.
Ilya stands up and places her hand on my forehead.

"Whoahey, Ilya..."
"Just be quiet. You'll enter some other place if you resist me too hard. It's troublesome to return things to normal if that happens."
She glares at me.
"Ohokay."
Under that kind of pressure, I can only nod obediently.

"That's a good boy. Then close your eyes. And don't look around too much, okay? Even though I'm transferring you, you'll get motion sickness because the view is someone else's."

"!"
Ilya places her forehead onto mine.
I'm surprised, but I close my eyes.
At that moment...

My vision accelerates and expands.
No, was it my consciousness that expanded?
The next thing I know, I'm looking down at an unfamiliar scene.

"Can you see it? I transferred your vision to my forest."

Ilya's voice echoes in my head.
I can't reply, nor nod back.
This "vision" is the only thing allowed for me.
I'm one of the trees in the forest.
It's natural that my body doesn't move.
My body has been turned into a tree in an instant.

"Did you memorize the route? Then I'll transfer you to the castle wall now."

The scene changes.
My vision is the only sense I have.
I still exist, but I can't feel myself.

I'm a wall now.
I can sense my limbs, but there are no limbs for me to move. I have a body that can move at will, yet I can't move it.

"Leysritt. I cannot find Ilyasviel-sama. Do you know where she may be?"
"......No. Ilya should be somewhere."
"Leysritt. Please do not refer to our lady so crudely. Ilyasviel-sama is not like us. Have you forgotten our mission?"

"Sella is Ilya's teacher. I'm to dress Ilya with Heavens Feel, the third dress."
"Correct. It seems even your poor memory can retain that."

"......I didn't forget. ...But Ilya hates wearing that. So I don't like it."

"...I understand that as well. But we need her to wear it when the time comes. We were made for that purpose.
 She must be prepared as well."

"......Sella."
"What is it, Leysritt?"
"......Don't you get tired?"
"Not at all!"

...I hear two identical maids talking.
When I realize those two are the maids Ilya was talking about...

...I finally return to my body.

"How was it? That was some great transformation magic, right?"
"UhUh..."

...I hold my mouth and bear my nausea.
I feel sick, suddenly feeling the realism of my body.

"Ilya... What was that?"
"It's transfer of consciousness. I moved your vision into some other object."

"There's a nerve going from your eyes to your brain, right? I connected that nerve to something other than your eyes.
 You were getting information from the trees in my forest instead of your eyes."

"......Hm. So it's not that I became the tree, but I received their vision and mistakenly thought I was one?"

"Oh, I thought you were dense, but you're actually pretty bright.
 Yes, that's right. That was magic to change the input while leaving the equipment called human alone.
 It's a big deal to change someone into a tree, but it's still in the realms of magic to connect one's consciousness to a tree. Far-sight and possession are an application of this magic."

"......I see. But that's pretty impressive stuff. I couldn't do anything when you transferred me to the tree. Couldn't you also use it to nullify your opponent?"

"Yes. Our specialty is in flow and transfer of power.
 For example, Tohsaka magi can transfer their magical energy into jewels without diluting its purity.  Using that same technique, they can also transfer someone's consciousness.
 If there's an enemy they want to seal, they can nullify him by transferring his consciousness into a jewel or an immobile doll."

"But the success rate of transferring someone's consciousness is so low that even we, the ones specialized in transfer, won't use it as an attack."

"The one I did to you was an exception. You didn't resist, and that forest is mine. It's normally much harder to connect things."

"And your consciousness will be forced to return if the original body is stimulated in any way.
 The body will call its consciousness back when it senses danger, even if the consciousness is unaware."

"That's what happened to you just now.
 You couldn't do anything when your mind was in the tree, but your body called you back when I shook it."

"...Hm. So this is something like a dream?"
You can never wake up from a dream, no matter how hard you try.
Dreams usually end when morning comeswhen the body wakes up out of habit.

"Hmm, it's a bit different. You can wake up from a dream using your will.
 But that's why transferral is not fit for offense. It's more for self-protection."

"If you transfer your consciousness to your familiar or a doll that can move, you can safely pursue magic."

"......So your consciousness just returns to your original body even if an enemy destroys your familiar?"

"Yes. Magi who transfer their minds usually hide their original bodies in a safe place.
 In cases like this, you need to watch out when you transfer into a familiar with its own soul."

"When you transfer your consciousness into something with a proper chain of command, the initiative is completely held by them."

"So even if you transfer into humans or animals, you can only occupy a corner of their brain and observe what they see. They will serve as a camera, not a remote-controlled robot."

"Moving your consciousness into a living thing with its own will is more like reincarnation than transfer.
 That alone is a great magic, so no ordinary magus would be able to do it."

...Reincarnation.
Magic to create an offspring with your soul in it after you die.
Some magi have achieved that goal, but I hear that reproducing a soul is difficult.

Even if you start over from the moment of birth, if you cannot inherit all the power of your previous self, you are a copy, not a reincarnation.
A copy is degraded by its very nature.
Therefore, a copied magus is inferior to his previous self.

"If you want to transfer yourself into a living thing, you can make a familiar without a soul.
 But the soulless familiars used today are weak. It's just like controlling a doll filled with cotton.
 They're only useful as messengers."

"And even if you transfer your consciousness into a familiar or doll, you will disappear if your original body grows old and dies.
 It's not immortality."

"The only eternal things in this physical world are souls.
 But nobody can keep souls by themselves. A soul cannot stay in this world without a body, and it will be destined with 'eventual death' once it obtains a body.
 Well, it just means that's the limit of magic by Einzbern and Tohsaka."

Then.
A bell rings the time.
The clock in the park points at three.
I guess it's already been an hour.

"Oh... I have to get going. Are you going home too?"
"Hm? Yeah, I should be heading home."

Ilya nods and walks to the middle of the park.

"...Okay. I shouldn't say this, but..."
The white girl asks me...

"Will you come see me again tomorrow, Shirou?"
...As if she knows I'm going to refuse.


You idiot.
I don't even need to answer.

"Of course I'll come tomorrow. You showed me your house, so it's my turn next."
"Okay! Then I'll be sure to call out to you first tomorrow!"

Ilya runs off.
Under the cloudy sky...
The white-haired girl looks like a fairy.
...I don't feel sick, so I guess I'll go outside.
I'm sure we haven't bought stuff for dinner, so I'll go to the shopping district.

"Saber and Sakura are..."
They're doing the dishes together.
I don't want to interrupt them, so I'll leave a note and sneak out

"Phew."
I managed to sneak out.
I left them a note saying "Going to buy stuff for dinner. Be back in an hour," so there's no problem.
I bet they won't get mad at me if I buy them some snacks.

"Phew..."
I leave the supermarket with bags full of food.
I didn't find any good deals, but I still bought a lot.
Sakura's going to be staying over for a while, so we need the extra groceries.

"We had udon for lunch, so maybe I'll make some meat for dinner."
I stop my feet.
"...?"
Someone's tugging at my shirt from behind.

"What's going on...?"
I turn around in wonder.
There...
...Stands a young girl with silver hair.

"W-What!?"
I quickly jump back.
I ready myself while the girl just stands there and smiles.

"...?"
I don't feel any hostility from the girl.
"I'm glad you're alive, Onii-chan."
She looks at me with a big smile.

"Wha"
...I'm sure of it. This girl is Berserker's Master.
She's the master of the monster who wounded me.
The girl of the family of magi who started this war, the family which my father betrayed.
Why is she here in the shopping district in broad daylight?

...It must be because the priest's story was so vivid. This girl doesn't feel like a stranger to me.
That's why...
"Ilya...?"
"Huh?"
...I blurt out her name without knowing what it means.

"Ohsorry, that's wrong...!
 Ilyayeah, it's Ilyasviel...!
 I-I'm sorry for getting it wrong...!"

I quickly apologize.
It doesn't matter if she's Berserker's Master or that she's the daughter of the Einzbern family.
It's just that...
I can't ignore that sad look on her face.

"......"
The girl is glaring at me, maybe because I shortened her name.
"OhI didn't mean to make you mad. I just blurted it out."

"......Tell me your name."
"What?"
"Tell me your name, Onii-chan. It's unfair that I don't know your name."

Oh, she's right.
Ilyasviel told me her name, but I haven't told her mine yet.

"I'm Shirou. Emiya Shirou."
"Emiyashiro? That's a strange name, Onii-chan."
"No. Emiya is my last name, and Shirou is my first name. If it's hard to say it, just call me Shirou."
I correct her pronunciation.


I point at the girl right at her nose, and she stands there in surprise.


It's too late to take it back, even if I wanted to.
The girl looks like she's about to cry, and...

"...Shirou, Shirou, huh? Yeah, I like the name.
 It's simple, but it sounds pretty. It suits you, Shirou.
 I'll forgive you for what you just did!"
...She embraces my arm.

"What!? H-H-Hold on, Ilyasviel! What are you doing...!?"
"No, you can call me Ilya, Shirou! I'm calling you Shirou, so this is fair!"

"Whawell, that's easier to say, but hold on!!!"
I try to shake her off, but Ilya just squeals with delight.

"...!"
This is bad. My neighbors might spread a bad rumor about me like this.

"Damn, what do you want...!? Do you want to fight me right now...!?"
I pull her off by force.

...Oh.
Ilya looks unhappy.

"W-What? Don't think making faces will change anything! I don't know what your intention is, but I'm a Master. You can't defeat me that easily"
I glare at her, groceries in hand.
...But she only watches me in wonder.

"......Um, Ilya?"
"Yeah!? What, Shirou!?"
"Ugh."

She's different from before.
...Well, she was laughing then too, but it's not the same. Could it really be?
"...Ilya. You didn't come here to fight...?"
I ask timidly.

"What? Do you want to be killed?"
"!"
Her glare sends a chill down my spine.
No matter how young this girl may be, she is the strongest Master.
She laughs innocently, but she can also become the ruthless Master.

"...Hmm. I don't get it, but I don't mind if you say so. I don't mind going ahead with my plans. Do you want to die along with Saber?"
"...Are you kidding me?  Of course not! I don't want to die, and I don't want to fight you here."

"Right? Masters can't fight during daytime. You don't have Saber with you, and I don't have Berserker with me."

"...You're right. Then why did you come here? Did we just meet up by chance?"
"It's not chance. I snuck out under Sella's nose especially for you. You better be grateful."
Ilya is inflated with pride.


I feel dizzy.
Every time I think she turns into a cruel Master, she returns to being the innocent girl.
I can't tell which is the real Ilya.

"...All right. So you came to see me.
 But you have no intention of fighting me. Am I correct?"
"Yup. I came to talk to you. I've waited all this time, so I can, right?"

I don't know what she means by "all this time," but it seems Ilya really did come just to talk to me.

"Or do you not want to? ...I'll go home if you don't. I really don't want to go home, but you'll hate me if I make you do something you don't want."
Ilya looks straight into my eyes.

"!"
...From a Master's point of view, it's dangerous to associate with Ilya. If Saber were here, she'd make her objections clear.


...But I can't just walk away from her when she's making a face like that.
I know it's reckless, thoughtless, and rash, but...

"I don't mind talking with you. Actually, I wanted to."

"All right! Then let's go over that way! I found a small park over there earlier!"
Ilya starts running.

"Come on, come on! I'll leave you behind if you don't hurry!"
She twirls about as she runs.

"Well, I guess it can't be helped."
I accept this event and follow after Ilya.
She called me Shirou.
Then I should treat her like a normal girl, not like a Master.

The park is empty.
Nobody is playing in the sand pit or on the swings.
It feels desolate, but I sit down on a bench with Ilya.

...I think this must look weird to other people.
Ilya's a foreigner, so we don't look like siblings, and our ages are too far apart to be friends.

"...So. What do you want to talk about, Ilya? You came to me, so do you have something you want to ask me?"

"Why? I have nothing I want to ask you."

Well.
How do I respond to that?

"...Ilya. You're the one who wanted to talk.
 So why do you say you have no business with me? You wouldn't come if that were true, right?"
"O-Oh, really? We can't talk if we don't have business?"

"Uhh... that's not what I meant. Sorry, I put it in the wrong way. We can talk even if we have no business. I guess it's better to talk without purpose.
 But... honestly, I don't know you really well, so I don't know what I should talk about. I don't know what you like, or anything like that. You don't want me asking you about something you'd rather not talk about, right?"

"Y-You're right... but what should I ask? Will you promise me you won't get mad even if I ask you anything?"
"I'll try. I'm your Onii-chan, so I'll try to act mature."
"I see. Then Shirou, do you like me?"

"WHA!?"
W-W-W-W-W-What the hell is she asking!?

"Oh, you're a liar! You said you won't get mad, but you're mad!"
"Hey, anyone would be shocked by that question! Y-You shouldn't be asking that question when you've already attacked me!"

"Hey, that was different! You jumped in the way, even though you were weak! It's not my fault!"

"It is your fault! You were ready to kill from the beginning! So why are you talking about me liking you and whatnot!?"
Ilya quivers up and shuts up.

"...Oh."
...Crap.
Look what I did, right after I said I'd forget about us being Masters.

"...Um, Ilya?"
"......I asked because it's important to me. You're an idiot, Shirou. You still want to talk big, even though you would've died if it weren't for me."
Ilya looks down, her shoulders shaking.

"......Man."
I guess it can't be helped.
I'm the one who started this whole Master conversation, I'm the older one here, and Ilya is a girl.

"Ahem. Um, Ilya..."
I prepare myself for what I have to say.

"I don't mind it anymore. My wound healed up, and you let me go.
 ...But if it still bothers you, then I won't bring it up again. Is that all right?"

"Oh... yeah. Um, so you're not mad, Shirou...?"
"I don't know why, but I'm not mad.
 I want to talk to you more now."

Ilya was about to cry, but now she smiles.

Seeing her smile makes me happy as well.
She doesn't feel dangerous to me.
Then I should stop thinking like a Master.
I guess I'll have to talk with her, just like she wants

My conversation with Ilya lasts for an hour.
Ilya listens to my ordinary stories and meaningless talks.

...Since when did it start feeling painful?
Ilya is an innocent girl.
The fact that she's a Master and that she has no doubt in that fact...
I think it's sad that she goes into battle with no fear.


A family of magi called Einzbern.
This young girl that is sent out as the greatest Master as a result of their thousand-year-old history.

If that is Ilya's goal, then...

"Ilya. Can I ask you something?"
"What?"
"Do you recognize the name Emiya Kiritsugu?"
...I have to ask her this.


The air freezes.
It is an emotionless silence.

"No. I don't know of such a guy."
...Her silver hair flutters.
Ilya gets up from the bench and twirls about like a fairy.

"It's getting late. Berserker wakes up at night, so I have to get going now."

Ilya waves goodbye.

"Yeah, I should go home too."
I get up.
This is all the rest I'm getting.
We'll have to fight as enemies again once the sun sets.

But...
"Can I talk with you again, Ilya?"
...I naturally ask this question.

"U-Um, I don't know. Do you want to see me again, Shirou?"
"Of course. I wouldn't ask you if I didn't want to."
"......! Okay, then I'll come again tomorrow if I feel like it. Don't expect too much and keep waiting, okay?"
She runs out of the park.

...But.
She suddenly stops and...

"I was lying. I do know of him."

"Ilya?"
"...I was given birth to this world to win the Holy Grail War. My goal is to kill you and Kiritsugu."

She sprints off.
Ilya leaves without turning around.
I watch her go until I can't see her anymore.
The Ryudou Temple.
The land is desolate after Caster has disappeared.
The monks, who have collapsed from an unknown cause, have left the mountain to leave the temple empty.
The gate is shut firmly, so neither worshippers nor monks can enter the place.

"Damn, what a stench. This is a real stinker."
A voice echoes through the place that should be desolate.
A lean blue figure glows in the moonlight.
The sturdily-built man with the crimson spear is a Servant called Lancer.

"Oh, wow. The boundary field is still here, even though Caster's dead?
 ...No, this is too crude.  Her work was much more polished than this."

Lancer looks around the temple.
The red lance is in his hand.
His objectives are to gain information and to keep watch.
He is unwilling, but he cannot disobey his Master's command.
It is his policy to follow any command given to him, and to accomplish the mission.
That is why he has fought several Servants and ended up in a draw with each.

As long as he serves this Master, Lancer will never start a fight.
This is no exception, and he is to investigate the Ryudou Temple.
If that is the case, why is his lance in his hand?
His weapon, his Noble Phantasm, can be summoned whenever needed.
There is no need for him to hold his lance when there is no enemy before him.

"Damn, what a racket.  I thought Caster was the master of wind, but maybe she used water instead.  This place is crawling with leeches and spiders"

He walks through the temple.
He seems too vulnerable and defenseless to be a Servant.
He is so defenseless that ifthis is an ifthere is another Servant here, he would be attacked and killed in an instant.

"But who knows?  Maybe the head has been replaced.
 There's nothing here but rotten insects. It's your habitual practice to nest on deserted houses."

Lancer doesn't stop cursing.
The blue spearman gives a speech as if to persuade a person who is not here.

"But there's one big one.
 I don't know where it was born, but it looks like it was raised by beasts deep within a mountain. And what is this, a smell of sand?
 Hah, I thought you were a big spider, but you turned out to be a dirty sandworm.
 Why the hell should I have to come and investigate a wretch like youwhoa!"

The silver lights are deflected.
Three rays of light streak forth from the darkness, only to be struck down by Lancer's lance.

The deflected lights are daggers called "Dark".
They are not a weapon to be held onto and to slash with, but a weapon to be thrown.
These daggers were thrown with great speed at Lancer's eyes and throat.

"You're pretty good. But don't do that again, sandworm.
 I don't like getting killed without a greeting first, and more importantly, it will be fatal for you."

The blue figure stands firm before the darkness.
In the darkness in front of Lancer is...

...A laughing skull, white as the moon.

The battle starts without a signal.
Lacking human words, the white skull attacks Lancer with an inhuman shriek, and Lancer meets his assault without twitching a brow.

The skull tosses daggers with a precision rivaling that of Archer.
Thirty are thrown from close range as he runs through the darkness.
But Lancer easily repels every one.

"Ki?"
The skull comes to an abrupt stop.
It is abnormal.
No matter how great a spearman Lancer may be, he could not possibly block all the daggers.
Furthermore, he is using a long lance.
How are the daggers, fired accurately in between his swings, all deflected?

"Hey. Don't tell me that's all you can do."
Lancer's presence changes.
He stops, and his hostility changes to a clear intent to kill.

"Then this is it.
 I don't know who you are... well, I guess I'll at least take off that mask of yours."

Daggers flash though the darkness.
A rapid barrage is unleashed as a counter to Lancer's charge!

But he blocks even that.
Although the daggers cannot be perceived, he turns them aside with a slight swing of his spear.


The skull is the one shivering.
Unable to speak human language, he can only swallow his scream and watch as the enemy comes to take his life
", Kii!"
He throws a dagger at the small opening in between Lancer's strikes...!

"Kii...!"
The skull's mask trembles.
Lancer blocks the dagger, turns the spear in a full circle, and smacks his opponent's chin from below.

Defense and counter.
He performs both actions in one motion.
Already committed to his attack, the skull cannot respond to such a maneuver.

The white mask falls from his face.
Lancer does not keep attacking.
His order is merely to observe his foes.
Even if this is a sure chance to kill, he has no authority to attack.

"You idiot. I told you projectile weapons are useless against me. You're the one who didn't listen to my warning."

Lancer readies his lance again and regards his enemy, who is now hiding his face.
A black body.
A right hand covered in bandages.
A face still hidden by the darkness.

No.
His face is flat and utterly featureless.

"GiyoU SAw My FaCe, Lan, cer."
"I'm about to. I'm sure you're a Servant, so let me check out which hero you are."
"Kuh. I sEE, YOu HavE A bINd. No WONdeR YoU, DiD, Not KilL, me."

The Servant retreats further into the shadows.
He still has the Dark in his hand, and his hostility is still emitting.

"Don't even try. It's my nature, but projectile attacks from a visible opponent aren't effective against me. You can't hurt me using a projectile unless it's some great Noble Phantasm."
"...! I sEE, PRoteCtIon AgaiNst ArrOws. ...Kuku, as EXpecTed frOm a HeRo WIth A nAMe. YoU Are nOT LIKe mE."

The shadow wavers.
The black Servant sinks down to the ground, then springs up in an instant as he throws another dagger.

If his leap is that of a deer, his movements are those of a spider, snake, or scorpion.
Even while keeping his face hidden, this Servant is as fast as Lancer when it comes to retreat.
But Lancer's charge is still the fastest.
It is a disgrace to take even a minute to corner his enemy.

"DamnI know I destroyed his throat, but he's persistent. It doesn't seem like it's healed, so he must be drugged"

The enemy glides across the water like a spider, and Lancer pursues him.
In contrast, water sprays from his footsteps, but his speed is far greater.

"...Hmph. If I'd known the pain wouldn't stop him, I would've cut his joints. I put that off since it doesn't work on other opponents, but"

It is fatal for a human body to be cut at the joint, where the main arteries lie.
If the arteries are severed, death from severe bleeding will quickly follow.
But that is only in normal combat.
You cannot expect a Servant, a heroic spirit, to die from excessive bleeding.

As their lifeforce is magical energy, cutting their arteries does not have much effect.
The loss of a limb is another story, but cutting off a Servant's limb is a difficult task.
Doing so will likely cost you your own head in the process.

"...Hashish, huh? I bet a heroic spirit who relies on drugs doesn't have healing powers. I'll end this fight with my next attack"
Water splashes with lightning speed.
His next attack will strike in two more seconds.
He tenses, then thrusts at his fleeing enemy's left leg
"!"
With a start, Lancer jumps back from the water's surface.

Water explodes upward.
No, something beneath the water is snarling.
Black tendrils snake out of the water, reaching for the spearman.
Is it because this creature dwells underwater?
It seems to resemble a deep-sea monster from ancient times.

"What... the...?"
Lancer has nowhere to run.
He instantly carves all his runes on the bottom of the lake to create a boundary field, but it is easily penetrated.

The dark tentacles are closing in on all sides, and his territory is shrinking by the second.
The protection using all his Runes, which can even block a great Noble Phantasm, does not even slow down the penetration.
Watching Lancer
"WHaT iS WrOng, LAncEr? It wILl SwaLLow yOu if yOU Do nOT MoVe."
Assassin sneers.

But even the sneering spider is no exception.
It seems these tendrils must engulf anything they can reach, as the spider does not approach the dark water.
He knows that if he draws near, they will take interest in new prey.

"BuT I wILL nOt aLLow THat. I MuST KiLL You. I nEEd mOrE EXperIenCE. I sHaLL KiLL YoU To aDD tO mY iNtELLigeNCe."

The spider's dagger glimmers.
The weapon about to be released is just a projectile.
But is it not meaningless?
Even though Lancer is surrounded by ghastly limbs, projectiles are meaningless against Lancer.

"You don't give up, do you? Well, I can understand why you feel that way."
Lancer observes the ghastly limbs around him.
He was lured quite far in, but it's only about thirty meters to the opposite shore.
He should be able to easily jump across such a distance...!

"You lost because you wouldn't move from there. I'm done with my investigation, so I'm out of here."
Lancer crouches low and braces his lance against the ground.
Using his lance as support, Lancer vaults into the air.
There...
"What?"
He is struck by the simplest of attacks.

A fake heart is taken out of Lancer's chest.
Assassin has directly gouged out Lancer's heart from the distant shore, an impossible range.

It is the purest magic, the simplest curse.
It is the "cursed hand", a magic of the Middle East, specialized in cursing people.
It is Assassin's Noble Phantasm, Zabaniya.
It surely destroys Lancer's heart, and the powerless body of the spearman falls into the black water.

The surface boils.
It is hectic, ferocious, and vulgar.
You would not see such a gruesome meal even if meat were thrown into a cage of starving beasts.
Numerous black limbs eliminate the human-shaped heroic spirit.
Watching it in delight as he stands on the black water...
The faceless Servant swallows the heart of his prey with satisfaction.
We'll patrol Shinto.
We can't let our guards down, even if Caster's been defeated.
We have to find Lancer's Master and determine whether he's good or evil.

"We'll go to Shinto. Please follow me like that."
"Understood. So the plan is the same as yesterday?"
"Yeah. We'll pretend we're normal citizens until we sense the enemy."

I turn off the light in the living room.
We exit the house silently so that we won't wake Sakura.

We patrolled the town for an hour, but we didn't find anything.

According to Saber, Caster's magical energy, which once permeated Shinto, is now fading away. However, I cannot sense the change.
I don't feel any magical energy that stands out, so there must be no Masters in Shinto...

"What is wrong, Shirou? You look gloomy."
"Huh...? Oh, it's nothing. I'm just wondering if the station was always this desolate. This place feels like a..."

I stop myself before I finish with the term "ghost town".
...I bet it just happened to be like this tonight.
There's nothing wrong. It's just that there isn't anybody walking about tonight.

"Let's go home, Saber. I don't think we'll find anything even if we walk around aimlessly."
"...You are right. You do not seem to be feeling well, so we should go home for tonight."

We leave Shinto.
Our footsteps echo through the empty station.
We'll patrol Miyama City.
It's that I want to secure my grounds, but also, Miyama City isn't as populated as Shinto.
I fear that Servants have more freedom to kill innocent people without having anyone notice.

"We'll look around the residential zone for tonight. ...I know this area is Tohsaka's territory and other Masters won't be able to do anything so easily, but we'll make sure of it."
"Understood. I have already verified that there are no enemies around here, but let us patrol the hill on the opposite side."

She must mean the Western-styled neighborhood.
It seems Saber patrolled the town while I was at school yesterday.

"Shirou? Are we not going?"
"O-Oh, we're going. Then please follow me, Saber."

I turn off the light in the living room.
We exit the house silently so that we won't wake Sakura.

...We don't see anything wrong with Miyama City.
We went by the Matou household, but it was silent, and we didn't feel any magical energy, nor the presence of a Servant.

"...I do not see anything abnormal. It has been a day since Caster was eliminated. I believe other Masters are keeping watch."
"...Yeah. I hope so."

  According to Saber, Caster's energy, which once covered Shinto, is now fading away.
There aren't any Masters that will suck up magical energy from innocent people now.

Butwhat is this vague uneasiness?

The town is quiet.
This place is deserted.
It was quiet yesterday as well, but it feels positively desolate tonight, almost as though we're trapped inside a still image.

"Let us go home, Shirou. There is nothing wrong with this area.
 You do not seem to be feeling well, so we should go home and rest for tonight."
"Y-Yeah, you're right. It's almost midnight, so we should go home."
Urged by Saber, we go up the hill.

...The town is quiet.
The moon hangs in the black sky as if frozen.
...I return to my room.
It's two o'clock. It's late, but there's still time to do my daily training.

"! ...Damn, I thought I got better."
I must have let my guard down, because the moment I return to my room, I'm overcome by drowsiness.
...Saber told me I should rest, so maybe I should skip my training and sleep for tonight.

"...Yeah. I should get a good night's sleep instead of pushing myself."
...I lay out the futon with languid motions, then fall onto it.
The futon smells like the sun.
It's because Sakura aired it out today.

"...I... wonder if Sakura's feeling better..."
I mutter absent-mindedly.
...It feels so good.
I feel myself relax as soon as I settle into the futon.  I must've been more tired than I thought.

"...Hm... I have to thank her tomorrow..."
I drop my eyelids.
In this atmosphere, gentle as a sunny day, I soon fall into a deep sleep.
It's been a few hours since we started training.
Saber's training is not what one can call kendo.
Saber doesn't practice kendo to begin with, and it seems she has no intention to teach me swordsmanship.

All she wants me to learn is the actual feeling of a battle.
She's helping me gain experience in battle so that I can stay composed when I fight other Masters, when our lives will be at stake.

I'm grateful for that.
There's no way she can teach me swordsmanship in a day or two.
All I can rely on is my body, which I have trained until now.
Then the best training I can get is practical experience, so that I'll be able react normally in critical situations

"There!"
"Ow...!"
Then.
As soon as my focus wavers, Saber's shinai strikes my chest.

"Shirou. Do not let your guard down just because you are out of range. Range does not matter with the skills you have.
 The only place you can afford to let your guard down is in this house."

"Sorry, I did let my guard down."
I climb to my feet, clutching my chest and coughing weakly.

"...Geez. You are surprisingly sharp at times, but defenseless at others. If you are able to control this"
Saber looks outside.

"What's wrong, Saber?"
"Well, Sakura is waving her hand at us from the porch. ...It seems she is calling for you, Shirou."
"M-Me...?"

...I wonder what it could be.
Sakura couldn't bear to watch me get beaten up, so she begged us to stop training.
She went back to the living room when I refused, but...

"...I'm going to the living room for a bit. Is that all right?"
"Yes. We have been training for two hours, so a rest is appropriate."
"Thanks. Then I'll get some tea while I'm at it."

"Oh, Senpai."
Sakura is standing by the phone when I arrive.

"...Um, you have a phone call. She's been waiting for you."
Sakura gets away from the phone.
"A phone call...? At this time?"
Could it be Fuji-Nee...? Maybe she wants me to bring something she forgot, or maybe she wants to tell me a joke she just came up with.

"All right. Hello.
 This is Emiya"

"It's not 'this is Emiya'!!
 Why are you absent without my permission!!!!!?"

The receiver roars.
What kind of magic is she using to make her voice rattle the walls through this small speaker?

"Man"
I shake my head to clear the ringing in my ears.
"Are you listening to me!? Are you okay!?"
The stranger, Tohsaka Rin, forges ahead without waiting for a response.

"...I'm listening. I'm listening, so lower your voice. My eardrums will burst if you keep talking like that."
"......Humph. Like always, you're missing the point. Well, it seems like nothing happened with the way you are.
 Geez, guess I was worried about nothing."

"......"
Her words are harsh and cold.
You're the one who never changes, Tohsaka.

"Well, what do you want?
 Did something happen to make you come calling me like that?"
"Yes, something did happen!  You went to the Ryudou Temple yesterday, even after I warned you not to."

"Ugh. How do you know that?"
"I had a lookout there. ...Well, I guess nothing happened, seeing that you're okay. I imagined something slightly bad since you weren't at school today."

"Oh, so you thought I was killed?"
"Yeah. I thought you were torn apart and buried on that mountain."
"......"
Well...
I don't think that's a "slightly bad imagination".

"Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm doing great... Well, I'm dying, but I'm hanging in there.
 So, what's your business?"
"Huh...? Well..."

"You can stop sounding me out.
 Oh, you want to ask about the Master at the Ryudou Temple, right? We beat himwell, actually, he was already gone.
 He was betrayed by his Servant, Caster.
 And"

...Wait, I can't talk any more about this subject.
Even though I'm whispering, Sakura is behind me.
I can't let her hear anything about people dying.

"Anyway, there's no Servant or Master at the Ryudou Temple anymore. That's what you wanted to know, right?"
"...Y-Yeah, you're pretty thoughtful."
"Then I'm hanging up. I'm training right now, so my whole body's in pain."
I end the conversation.

"H-Hold on!"
"...? What, you don't have any more business, right?"
"I-I do...! Come to school tomorrow. I have something important to talk to you about."
Smack!
She slams the receiver down. Well, that's just like her.

"...Man, how selfish of her. She got mad at me for going to school yesterday, and now she wants me to go tomorrow."
I put the receiver down.
I turn to go prepare the tea I promised.

...Then.
I see Sakura, hanging her head for some reason.

"Sakura? Are you feeling all right?"
"Yes, but... I'm just wondering what happened to make you seem so happy."

"What?"
I seem happy?
Did I look happy when I was on the phone with Tohsaka?

"No way. I'm actually mad."
"...That's... why. You don't even notice it yourself."
Sakura looks away awkwardly.

"...Hm?"
I wonder about her behavior as I make tea for the three of us.

By the time we finish our training, the sky is tinted red.

"I'm done preparing the yellowtail. We also need pumpkin and tomatoes, right?"
"Oh, I've taken care of that. I'm putting the sauce on before I cook it... Oh, can you take out the bowls since I'll be making savory egg custard? Fuji-Nee went out and bought some crabs yesterday."

"Oh, the crab-flavored fish paste? I like that because they're tasty and nice-looking."
Sakura takes out the bowls and places them on the kitchen counter.
I'm making dinner to thank her for everything she did today.

I want Sakura to relax in the living room with Saber, but she stubbornly insists on helping me.

"...?"
Then...
We're interrupted by the doorbell.
Sakura's already here, so that means there's a visitor at my place.

"Oh, I'll go get it. If it's a newspaper salesman, I'll send him away."
"Sakura?"
Sakura goes to the front door before I can stop her.


...I have a bad feeling about this.
I put the radish down and go to the front door.

The doorbell hasn't stopped ringing.
Whoever it is, they must be hysterical.
Sakura unlocks the door to greet the visitor.

At that instant...
"Why aren't you coming home!?"
I hear a heavy sound and some angry words.

It happened in an instant.
The doorbell doesn't stop.
"Who is it?"
Sakura opens the door while calling out to the visitor.
"!"
Shinji throws the door open and storms in.

"Nii-san...!?"
"Heywhy aren't you coming home!?"
As soon as Shinji sees Sakura, he raises his arm, and...

He smacks her, but what slams into her cheek isn't the palm of his hand, but a fist.

"Wha"
I run.
Sakura hits the wall and crumples to the floor.
Shinji runs to Sakura, with his arm ready to punch her again

"What are you doing, Shinji...!?"
"Humph. I'll do whatever I want. If she spends the night at someone's house without my permission, it's only natural that she gets punished."
"It's... natural...?"

"Are you deaf? I'm saying a piece of shit who won't do as she's told deserves to get hit.
 You're the one who's seducing her in the first place. How are you any different from me? We're both using Sakura as we please."


I'm speechless.
I seriously...

"Oh, what's that? You got to do her once last night, and now you don't want to let her go because you want more? I can't blame you, Sakura is"


...Want to kill Shinji.

"Huh? What's with that face? Are you stupid?"
"Shinji."
"Ooh, I like that tone. All right, let's pick up where we left off, Emiya."

I clench my fist.
I can't stop myself.
I
I can't restrain myself, and I shouldn't even try to.
I clench my fist tighter.
Shinji just stands there, smiling as he awaits my attack, and
I suppress my anger with all my might.
What good will it do?
My fight with Shinji has already ended.
It's meaningless to attack Shinji now, and I can't fight Shinji in front of Sakura
"Please stop, Nii-san...!
 Please, don't do it here!"
I get myself together with her voice.

"Sakura."
"What a surprise. Isn't this the first time you've talked to me like that?"
Shinji's voice sounds more delighted than I've ever heard from him.
Sakura is hanging her head, her body trembling.

"So? Say it again. I couldn't hear you really well."
"......Yes. I'll do anything you say, so please don't do it in front of Senpai. I'll go home if you tell me to."

"Ohh. So you're going to do anything I say?"
"........."
Sakura nods.

"I see. If you're so determined, then I won't take you home. A big brother has to respect his sister's wishes, after all. Isn't that right, Emiya?"
"Shinji."

"Haha. Don't make such a scary face. That was just a joke. People will form a bad opinion of you if you won't let go of your grudges."
Shinji walks back to the front door.

"Bye. Take care of Sakura, Emiya.
 But don't forget what you just said, Sakura."
Shinji waves goodbye and leaves.
He leaves alone, without taking Sakura with him.

We resume cooking.
"........."
Unsure of what to say, I cut up the tomatoes and pumpkins in silence.
The unbroken sound of chopping gives the kitchen an awkward atmosphere.

"The rice is done, Senpai. Fujimura-Sensei isn't here yet, but we can start dinner without her, right?"
"Ohyeah. It's a bit early, but let's do that."
"Okay. I'll prepare right away."

Sakura moves briskly, as if nothing happened.

...She's obviously pushing herself.
Sakura pretends to be okay so that I won't be worried.

"......"
I should act that way too if that's how Sakura's going to act.
Sakura's the one who got hurt.
If she's going to smile, I have to smile as... well...?

"Sakura?"
The sound of a bowl breaking causes me to turn around.

Pieces of the shattered bowl are by Sakura's feet.


".....!"
Sakura suddenly collapses.
She sinks to a sitting position, then keels over backward

"Sakura!"
I quickly raise her off the floor.
"Ow...!?"
Sakura's body is burning hot, even through her uniform.

"Sakura... Hey, Sakura...!"
"EhSen... pai...? What's... going on...?"

There's no strength in her voice.
But she tries her best to say something.

"It's not 'what's going on'...!? You're still sick...!"
"Oh... no... I'm fine."
"You idiot...! You wouldn't collapse like that if you're fine!"

Damn, I'm an idiot.
I knew Sakura had a cold, but I overworked her without thinking.
And to finish it off, there's what happened just now. After everything she's been through physically and mentally, it's natural that she'd collapse!

"I'm sorry for breaking the bowl, Senpai.
 I'll clean it up right awakya!?"
I hold up Sakura in my arms.

"S-Senpai!?"
"Dinner can come later. I'm going to take you to bed and have you rest. Complain to me after you get better."

I head to the outbuilding with Sakura in my arms.
She's trying to say something, but I ignore her.
I'm so mad that I can't talk.


Sakura must have given up, as she is silent by the time we get to the guest room.
She hangs her head, but follows my directions.
Although her face is flushed with fever, it doesn't seem all that bad.

I leave her room.
I'm changing the menu for tonight.
I have to hurry and go make some rice porridge so that I can return her favor.

It's almost ten o'clock.
We ate dinner, and it's time to start patrolling the area.

"......"
Sakura is sleeping in the guest room.
I ate dinner with Saber.
Fuji-Nee never showed up, so she must be busy tonight.

"Shirou. It is almost time."
"......"
Saber urges me.
For tonight
I can't leave Sakura alone tonight.
It's not like I can do anything, but I want to stay here so that I can go help her if she needs help.

"I'm sorry, Saber. We're not patrolling tonight. I'm worried about Sakura."
"Understood. I will follow your order."
"What?"

I-I'm surprised.
I thought Saber would object, but she readily accepted my proposal.

"Please do not misunderstand. Sakura is not the only one who is sick. You are exhausted as well, so please rest for tonight.
 The extra time will help you replenish your magical energy. You are not to push yourself."
"Thanks, Saber."

"Y-You do not need to thank me. I am your Servant. It is natural for me to place my master's welfare first."
Saber reaches out for her tea.

"So, Shirou. Have you a reward for your considerate servant?"
Saber makes a cute request with eyes full of expectation.

"OhI see. Hold on, Saber."
I realize she wants something to eat with the tea, so I grab the cookies that Fuji-Nee bought for her.


I shut off my Magic Circuit.
I sigh with relief after the stick of fire exits my spine.

I've skipped my daily routine for the past few days, but it went pretty smoothly tonight.
Even though it used to be a challenge, activating my Magic Circuit is easy now.  Maybe it's because of my contract with Saber.

"But it's no good if it takes me a minute to do it."
The only weapon I can use has to be prepared beforehand using my "strengthening" magic.
If I'm attacked by surprise, I'll have no way of fighting back.
If I can shorten the time to around thirty seconds, maybe I'll be able to do something

"Maybe I'll ask Tohsaka about it. She might know how to quickly make a Magic Circuit."
Well, I can't ask her just like that.  Who knows what she'll demand in return?

"Hm...?"
I hear footsteps.
The person is walking slowly.
...It's midnight.
The person coming here under the moonlight is...
"Senpai...? Are you still awake?"
Sakura, who looks much better than earlier tonight.


My mind blanks out.
...Sakura's wearing something I don't recognize.
It takes me completely by surprise.
It must be the change of clothes Fuji-Nee prepared for her, but seeing her in something other than her uniform makes my head spin.

"...Um, Senpai?"
"OhYeah, I'm awake. Are you okay, Sakura? It's cold outside."
"Yes, my fever's almost gone. I came outside to refresh myself and heard a sound, so I thought it might be you."

"I see. Then all that's left is to warm yourself up and go back to sleep. That's good."
I turn on the stove I just fixed.

Good, it works.
This should warm up this place.

"Here. It's still pretty chilly in here, but it's better than outside.
 ...Um, if you're not sleepy anymore, I can keep you company."

"Okay. Then please excuse me, Senpai."

Sakura comes in, her steps steady and sure.
...Good, it looks like she's really better.  That's a relief.

"It's warm. So this was fixable."
"Somehow. I almost didn't bother trying since it was so old."

"You're right. You got mad and said you'd rather fix the VCR Fujimura-Sensei cut in half.
 But you couldn't throw it away, right?"

"...Well, I guess this stove wasn't the only obstinate one."
 It was broken, but it looked fixable, so I just couldn't leave it alone.

"You don't listen to others once you set your mind on something, Senpai. You seem sensible, but you're actually very stubborn. Did you know that?"
"...Hm. Am I stubborn?"

"You are. And you're really forceful.
 You didn't listen to me earlier, either."

...?
Even though Sakura's criticizing me, she's in a good mood.
...Well, I'm too happy to see her doing well to care about that.

"...I'm sorry. I was too angry to think straight."
"You're right. You were just as mad at me as at yourself. ...Yes. I'm causing you lots of trouble. But I really was sorry because I thought I did something awful."

"......"
Sakura is perfectly composed.
It's probably partly because she just got over a cold, but she's not merely putting on a strong face. This seems like the "real" Sakura to me.

"I remember when I was a child.
 I always stayed in the house and couldn't say what I wanted. I thought everything would work out if I didn't say anything."

"...But it didn't do any good. I didn't want to worry anyone, but never speaking worried Nii-san and my dad even more."

"...I see. But it's true that you cared for your father and Shinji, so I bet they knew how you felt. There are things that can be communicated without words."

"Yes. I hope that's true.
 ...So what about you, Senpai? I don't hear much about when you were a child."

"Uh, me...? Hmm, I don't think I was too different. I was always running throughout the town during the daytime, making meals for my father, and messing around with stuff here at night."
I get embarrassed, so I scratch my cheek.
...Does it mean I'm a failure as a man if I haven't changed from when I was a kid?

"Wow. You were running throughout the town?"
"Yeah... I thought I was patrolling the town. I admired helping the weak and crushing the strong."

My battlefield was mainly in the park.
I think it was an everyday thing to fight with children my age against people older than me.
...Hmm, now that I think about it, a smart and devil-like person was in my age group too...

"I see, so you were protecting the town from bullies? You were like that even when you were little?"
"Sakura. Smiling like that reminds me of all the stupid things I did, so please stop. It's pretty embarrassing."

"It's not embarrassing at all. I would've been your sidekick if I met you as a child.
 A shy person like me needs someone to drag her outside."

"...A sidekick?"
...Oh. Well, I might have trained Sakura every day if she'd been with me as a child.
I would've run by the river or sat in the dojo with her.

That's pretty much what a sidekick would do.
Under my watchful eye, Sakura would become strong, and then she would turn into a devil like...

Her, or her.

"Ugh."
A chill runs down my spine.
Good. I'm really glad that Sakura is modest.

"Um, Senpai?"
"Huh? Oh, I was out of it. I was just talking to myself, so please don't worry about it."

"...Okay. That's fine, but, um... Can I ask you an awkward question?"
"...? Okay, what?"

"...I heard this from Fujimura-Sensei. Is it true that you were adopted into the Emiya family?"
"Huh? Didn't I tell you? I'm adopted, just like Fuji-Nee told you."

"U-Um, Senpai? That means..."
"Well, it's true, and it's nothing I should hide. Why are you asking such a thing?"

"Eh... um, don't you care about it? You were adopted into a stranger's family, so, um... weren't there a lot of things you didn't like?"

"Oh, did Fuji-Nee give you the wrong idea?
 ...Well, it might've looked that way when I first came here, but it wasn't hard on me, and there was nothing I didn't like."

"Then was it fun for you, Senpai?"

Hm.
This is the first time I've been asked this question.
After that fire...
...My first year here was spent healing my wounds.

...And after that...
My time until now has been spent in constant motion.
I studied magic to be more like Kiritsugu, and I ran around the town, looking for the reason why only I survived that night.

I never had time to wonder if I was enjoying myself.

"Hmm, I don't know. I don't know if it was fun for me or not. I just wanted to be like my father."

"You mean to be a superhero, like Fujimura-Sensei said?"
Sakura asks timidly.
To that...
"Yeah. Is that weird?"
I answer while scratching my cheek.

"No, I don't think so.  It's amazing that you're so sure of yourself."

Her words are calm.
I usually get embarrassed from such words, but her words hit me so much that I'm tempted to thank her.

"Here's another question. Would you be able to forgive me if I become a bad person?"

"What...?"
My head blanks out from the sudden question.
...But to answer seriously...
"No. I'd get mad if you do something bad. I'd get more mad than anybody else."
I'd probably be first in line to scold her.

"I'm glad.  I'd want you to do that."
Sakura nods in relief.

"...?"
Seeing her smile makes me think that something like this happened before.

"I'm going back to my room. Good night, Senpai."
Sakura leaves.
As I see her off, I try to remember where I've seen that smile before, but my memory fails me.

I return to my room.
I lie on my futon, trying not to wake Saber, and right when I'm about to close my eyes...

"I remember now."
In a sudden flash of insight, it comes back to me.
Yes, it was

It was in the shed, just like tonight.
It was two years ago... no, one and a half years to be exact.

It happened during the summer two years ago.
I continued to refuse every time Sakura offered to come help me at my house.
But Sakura did not give up and kept visiting my house with obstinacy you would never expect from her.

I gave upwell, Sakura's effort beat me to be exact, but I called Sakura to the shed and admitted my defeat.
"You beat me. I lost, so I'll give you this."

It was an old key.
I gave Sakura the key to my house that I kept in the shed which Kiritsugu used to use.

Surprised, Sakura tried to refuse.
She said something ridiculous about how a stranger couldn't possibly accept such a gift.

"Hey now. You're coming to help me every day, so you're no stranger.
 Please feel free to use this. ...Um, it would help me out if you did."

I forced the key into her hands.
And that's when I saw it.
"...Okay. Thank you, Senpai. This is the second gift I've received from someone dear to me."
Sakura smiled happily as she nodded.

"OhI see."
That's what's been bugging me.
Sakura works hard and always has a warm smile.
But that was the last time her smile looked satisfied

"So. I think people get mad when they're told the truth."

Tohsaka ponders as she eats my lunch.
She came to the rooftop empty-handed.
Which, of course, meant that she didn't have her lunch.
Then it was only natural for her to target mine.

"Just eat. ...Man, why do you have chopsticks when you don't have your own lunch? Do you always carry them around?"

"...? I just brought these with me when I left my classroom. You had your lunch last time, so I thought I'd have you share some of yours. I came prepared just in case you had boxed lunch."

"...Hey now. I think you're putting thought into the wrong areas."
Bring some food before you bring chopsticks.

"Don't worry about minor details. You brought two people's worth of food, so it turned out fine."

"......"
No, this isn't two people's worth of food.
It's just that Sakura made too much.

"...Oh well. It's true that I won't be able to finish it by myself. Oh, don't just eat the vegetables. Eat some meat as well. I'll get an upset stomach if I just eat meat."

"What? I don't want it because that's too sweet.
 Don't tell a girl to eat meat. I'm keeping track of how much I've eaten, so if I'm not eating it, that's a sign that I've had my share."

"Liar. I bet you're the type that doesn't hold back when you go eat yakiniku. I'm suuuuuure of it. You'll be scarfing down beef ribs while I'll be munching on my salted fish.
 You won't show any consideration for my money.  In fact, you'll try to bankrupt me. And after you're satisfied, you're going to tell me, 'Heh, I went easy this time.'"
I try to get back at her for what she said earlier.

"...Well said, Emiya-kun. I find it scary that I can't deny that."

...No.
You're the scary one, Tohsaka.

"But this lunch sure is strange. There's a lot of food here, but the wrapping and all is really feminine. Do you like to cook, Emiya-kun?"
What a coincidence.
I think I heard the same exact thing this morning.

"...Well, it's not like I hate cooking, but Sakura made today's lunch.
 Oh, Sakura is"
"...Tohsaka? What's wrong? Did you bite on a lump of sugar?"
"...Oh geez... I did it..."
Tohsaka sighs and puts away her chopsticks.

"Thanks. You can eat the rest by yourself."
Tohsaka gets away awkwardly.

"...?"
Well, it's fine if she's full already.
I was nervous eating lunch next to Tohsaka.  Now I can enjoy a little peace of mind.

I head back to my classroom.
It's a few minutes before fifth period starts, and the hallway is filled with students going back to their classrooms.

In contrast, the stairs are quiet and empty.
Not many students go to a different floor to eat.
There...
I bump into Sakura.

She looks away awkwardly as soon as she sees us.
"...?"
What could be wrong with her?
She was so energetic this morning, but she looks depressed now.

"Sakura"
I call out to her.
But before I can say anything else...

"I'm sorry, Sakura. It was bad timing on my part."
...Tohsaka steps forward.

"Eh... No, you didn't do anything wrong. Even if Senpai and Tohsaka-Senpai are together, it has nothing to do with"

"You're misunderstanding. I went and invited him because I had to talk to him about something. And he didn't skip out on you, either. He just didn't realize it."
"...Hmmm? What do you mean? It's not like I made a promise with Sakura"

"You idiot. She made lunch for you, so that means she wanted to eat with you. It's natural for Sakura to be mad."
"What?"
H-Hold on.
We never made any promise to eat together

"...U-Um, Senpai? How about eating at the archery range in that case?
 The range is open during lunchtime, I can make you some tea, and it's quiet there"

And...
...When I look, I see that Sakura's lunch is untouched.


...That's right.
What was I thinking!? Tohsaka's absolutely right to call me an idiot...!

"I-I'm sorry, Sakura! I'm so stupid...!"
"N-No, it's fine! See, it's not like we made a promise, and I just thought it might be good if we could eat together"

"It's not good! Let's go, Sakura! We'll still make it!
 We can eat quickly in the archery range and"
I grab Sakura's hand and start running.

But.
"There's no way you'll make it. What can you do in three minutes?"

"!"
Tohsaka's calm analysis stops me.
...I panicked because I felt guilty for breaking the promise, but Tohsaka is one-hundred-percent right.

"It's fine, Senpai. We have to go back to our classrooms, just like Tohsaka-Senpai says."
"Ugh... But Sakura..."

"Please don't worry too much about it. That was enough for me. Thank you."

I don't know what to say when she makes a face like that.

"Then I'll be going. You two will be late if you don't hurry."
Sakura goes up the stairs with her lunch in her hand.

"I'd better get going too.
 Go to the Chinese restaurant in the shopping district after school. Wait there, okay?"

Then.
Tohsaka leaves a strange message before she leaves for her classroom.

Fifth period ends and the room empties out quickly.
It's not even two o'clock yet.

"...Phew. I don't feel like it, but Tohsaka told me to."
There's nothing I can do here, so I guess I'll go to the shopping district.
We walk up the hill.
There are more students around us than usual.  It must be because there's no morning practice today.

"We still have time. It's been a while since we had a morning where we could take it easy."
Sakura is walking happily besides me.
I don't know why, but she's in a good mood.

"This is normal for me, but... I guess it has been a while since I went to school with you."
"Yes. The archery club practices every morning."

"But participation isn't required, right? Most people only go once every two days, so you should skip once in a while."
"What? U-Um, would you walk to school with me if I skipped practice?"

"...? Of course. We're going to the same place, so we'll be walking together either way."
"Oh, then
 No, I can't do that. I'm not that good, so I can't afford to skip a day of practice."
Sakura sticks her tongue out at herself.

"...? Are you sure about that? Not to speak ill of anyone, but you're the best in your grade. You have great form, so I don't think there'll be any trouble, even if you skip a day or two."

"No, I'm still inexperienced. My thoughts trail off if I let my guard down, and I often don't see the target.
 I'm lazy at heart, so I tend to slack off unless I push myself to train a little every day."
...Hm.
If that's how she feels, who am I to disagree?

I part with Sakura.
My class is on the third floor, and hers is on the fourth.

"I'll see you later, Senpai."
"Yeah. Don't fall asleep during class. People tend to get sleepy when they're full."

"Ahaha, you don't need to worry. I'm not full anymore."
Sakura goes up the stairs.
I wave goodbye to her and head to my classroom.

It's lunchtime.
Shinji is absent, and so is Issei.
...It seems Issei is being treated at the hospital after the incident at the Ryudou Temple.
Now that I look around, I see that there are more people absent.


But the number of absentees shouldn't get any higher, at least.
The Servant that was sucking the life force out of people in this town has been eliminated.
There should be no more unexplained comas.

"Yeah. The people Caster harmed will get well and come back soon."

I pull myself together.
There are four Masters remaining.
Two, if you don't count Tohsaka and Ilya. I can't let my guard down until I know what kind of people they are.

Oh.
We speak out in unison.
I bump into Tohsaka the instant I go out into the hallway.

"Hey, what do you mean, 'oh'? Isn't that a rude thing to say? Or do you have a guilty conscience?"

"Hey, the same goes for you, you were surprised too.
 ...And what was up with the phone call last night? You were being selfish, telling me not to come and to come."

"Well... Yesterday was an exception. You skipped school the day after the Master at Ryudou Temple disappeared.  Of course I thought something happened to you.
 ...Um, I told you about the Ryudou Temple, so it'd trouble me if something happened to you."


...I'm surprised.
Did Tohsaka feel responsible because she told me about it?

"I see. Thanks, Tohsaka. You were worried about me, right?"
"T-That's not true! I just want to know the details of what happened, since I gave you the information!"

"Huh? But I told you over the phone yesterday, right? Both Caster and her Master are defeated. There's nothing at the Ryudou Temple anymore."
Huh?
Tohsaka looks serious all of a sudden.

"What's wrong, Tohsaka? Did I say something weird?"
"Yes, you did. It's not that I don't trust you, but let me confirm. You're absolutely certain that you defeated Caster?"

"...Humph. Even I could tell that.
 Saber completely eliminated Caster. ...Caster's Master is"
...He was already dead when we got there.

"...All right. There's something I want to talk about regarding that. Can you come to the rooftop?"
There's only one Chinese restaurant in the shopping district.
Koushuuensaikan: Taizan.
It's an ominous dungeon in the shopping district, with no windows to show you what's inside.  Most first-time customers run away after seeing the place.
The manager, a favorite of the neighborhood association, is a strange little Chinese man nicknamed "small manager."  Batsu-san has a tendency to fill every dish with red pepper.

In other words, the food's hot.
Really hot.
Imagine being stabbed in the tongue and then having salt rubbed into it, and you'll be on the right track.

This restaurant's infernal seasonings have given me a general distaste for Chinese food.
It doesn't help that the manager keeps adding "aru" at the end of every sentence.

"......"
And now I'm entering this terrible dungeon willingly.
The manager will bring a menu as soon as he sees me.
That'll be the end of it.
At the very least, I'll have to order something that uses sweet vinegar.

It'll turn out horrible if I order something like twice cooked pork, and mapo tofu is out of the question. That stuff is dangerous. It'll melt my tongue. I hear the judge of hell pulls out your tongue, so such awful food could easily come from there. The manager traveled abroad to train his cooking arts, so maybe he trained with the devils.

"Phew."
It's almost two-thirty.
I promised to be here right after school, so I can't hesitate any longer.

"All right, I'm going!"
I don't know why I have to get pumped up to go into a restaurant, but here it's necessary.
I'm not sure what Tohsaka was thinking when she said we should meet here, but I'm sure she's regretting it now.

Wait.
"Hm? You're finally here, Emiya? I came early, so I have already started eating."
The priest is eating mapo tofu.


I'm speechless.
Why is Kotomine here?
Why is he eating mapo tofu that looks like a boiling pot?
And why is he eating it so fast?
He's sweating, but he never stops for a drink, spiritedly moving his hands as if they will never move again if he stops.

Actually... Is he just being stubborn? He's eating it way too fast.
Or is it that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

Then this is bad. This restaurant and Kotomine are both bad.
That food has dangerous amounts of spice. It can't be explained any other way.

"What's wrong? Don't just keep standing and sit down."
The priest talks as he keeps eating.

"......"
I take caution as I sit across from him... Well, I'm not too sure what I'm on guard against.


I watch his movements.
...Amazing. He only has about two more mouthfuls left.
I watch in amazement when Kotomine suddenly stops eating.



Our eyes meet.
Kotomine watches me with his usual oppressive eyes and...
"Do you want some?"
"I don't want any!"
I reply with all my might.

The priest frowns a bit before he finishes the mapo tofu.
...Huh?
Did my reply disappoint him?

...The only one waiting for me is Kotomine.
It seems he asked Tohsaka to invite me here.

"...So, what do you want? Isn't it unusual for you to come talk to someone?"
"Well, I heard that you have already defeated two Servants. I came to commend you on your achievements."
...He's lying.
Even if it is true, he should have picked a better restaurant.

"I see. I'm sorry, but I think your words are good enough.
 I'm not fighting for your sake. There's no reason for you to praise me."
"Hm. I guess there was no need for banal flattery.
 Then let me cut to the chase. You heard from Rin that Caster is still alive, correct?"

"...Yeah. Caster still exists, and she's collecting magical energy from the people in town, right?"

"Yes. I do not know if it is related, but there was another Servant at the Ryudou Temple on the night you defeated Caster.
 I believe it to be Assassin, judging by the appearance and combat style, but I am not certain."

"Assassin... Then Assassin was also at the Ryudou Temple? But Saber said..."

"She did not sense him, right? Assassin is not a strong heroic spirit, but their class has the special ability to conceal its presence. Covert action is their area of expertise. Even Saber should not be able to sense Assassin if he hides his presence."

"......"
Then that means Assassin was at the Ryudou Temple on the night we defeated Caster.
Was he hiding near us, trying to find an opening to attack?

"...I understand. But why are you telling me all this? I thought the supervisor doesn't help one particular Master."

"I am merely sharing information with you. I have told you all I know. In exchange, tell me what you have experienced over the last few days. ...There is something strange about this Holy Grail War.
 Something is different from the last war."


"If you do not wish to tell me, I will not force you. Just take my words as a warning."

"...No, I'll pay your price. After all, you came out and gave me information that I needed."

"Hah. You have a strong sense of duty as always, Emiya Shirou."
The priest smiles in satisfaction.
...Heh. It seems he knows every move I'm going to make.
But I'm not going to fall for his tricks that easily.

"I'll talk. But first, I have a question.
 How do you know such a thing?
 You wouldn't know that Assassin was at the Ryudou Temple unless you had a Servant."

No, he shouldn't know even if he does have a Servant.
Neither Saber nor Archer, Tohsaka's Servant, could tell.

"It is simple. My Lancer was defeated by Assassin at the temple. As his Master, I needed only retrieve his last sight."
Then.
The priest simply states something absurd.

"What?"
"I said that I am also a Master. You said it too. That I would not know unless I had a Servant.
 Well, you are certainly correct."

"Huhwhat!?"
"But that ended last night. Lancer has been eliminated, which means that I am not a Master. I am no longer your enemy.
 Well, is that all you want to ask me? Then it is your turn to talk. Tell me who you met and what you saw over the past couple of days."

The atmosphere becomes heavy in an instant.
He doesn't allow me any questions.
He wants answers.

"......"
...I have a lot of things I want to ask him, but I have to answer him first.
In as much detail as possible, I recount what happened to me after making my contract with Saber four days ago.

...The story lasts for about thirty minutes.
I haven't done much as a Master.
The information I provided is mostly useless.
But the priest takes great interest in Matou Zouken.

"Matou ZoukenI thought he had withered away, but he is still active? I guess it is true that he is a blood-sucking monster."

"Huh...? That old man is a blood-sucking monster...?"
"Yes. The magic of the Matou family is absorption. I hear that Matou Zouken, a magus from six generations back, was a prominent bug user."

...?
Using bugs... That doesn't mean his familiar is a bug, right?
Or... another way to use bugs is...

"Hold on. By bug user... do you mean like guys who use bugs as a medium for poison? Like, putting in hundreds of poisonous bugs in a pot, and using the last surviving one as a curse...?"

"No, that is wrong. From the start, cursing is outside of the Makiri's area of expertise.
 The results of their magic always return to their bodies.
 Cursing others would only result in mutual destruction."

"...Then he's using bugs as familiars?"

"Yes. Matou Zouken is merely a monster who feeds on the blood of others.
 I hear that he kept his youth by transfiguring his body and sucking blood, and that he has lived for a few hundred yearsbut...
 Based on what I heard from Rin's father, he is now on the verge of death, and can no longer walk in broad daylight."

"...He can't walk in broad daylight? ...Well, I did meet him both times at night"
He sucks on people's blood to prolong his life.
And he can't walk under the light of the sun. That's just like

"...Kotomine. Is Matou Zouken a vampire?"
"Heh. He is more like a parasitic insect. His nature and personality are like those of an insidious slug."
He insults Zouken.
It seems Kotomine really hates that old man.

"...You said he's been alive for a few hundred years. Then was he ever a Master?"

"No, Matou Zouken was never a Master. He is like a counselor for the Matou familybut he is a monster that lived for hundreds of years. He might have devised a plan to become a Master in a way we do not know of."

"...Then the one who made a contract with Caster after her Master was killed is..."

"Who knows? But he is not someone you can let your guard down against.
 If he has taken the stage, he must believe his victory is certain. That means that the Matou family's Master has the support of the worst devil in Makiri history."


Shinji said he hasn't given up.
And he has the backing of Matou Zouken.
He lost his Command Spell, but that old man might be able to give him a new Servant.

"You have been a great help. All these abnormalities make sense if the Makiri elder is in action. As the war's supervisor, I shall try to suppress the damage."
Kotomine nods to himself and relaxes.

"Supervisor, huh? You're not one to talk when you were secretly a Master until yesterday."

"Do not put it like that. I have no wish. I obtained Lancer because I wanted to give the Holy Grail to a more appropriate desirer.
 But that is over now. It is for the remaining Masters to decide.
 Well, personally, I would like either you or Rin to obtain the Holy Grail."


...I frown.
The priest is serious.
He just said that he doesn't need the Holy Grail.
In fact, he clearly told me that he wants either Rin or I to obtain it.

"...Why? You became a Master because you want the Holy Grail, right? Don't you have a wish you want granted?"

"Let's see. I do not have a wish, but I do have a goal. My goal is not a serious matter, and it is meaningless even if I achieve it myself."
"...?"
A goal that is meaningless if he achieves it himself...?

"What are you talking about? If you want to tell riddles, find somebody else."
"Consider it a friendly warning. We are the same, you and I. As we do not have clear wishes, we cannot seek salvation.
 I simply thought it would be easier for you if you quickly realized it."

"What?"
I feel like he has grabbed my heart in his hand.
The priest's words seep into my mind like a curse.

"Kotomine, you"
I constrict my wavering eyes and glare at him.
And then

"Here's your mapo tofu-aru!"

The second and third plates of mapo tofu are placed on the table.

"Hm."
Kotomine picks up his spoon.
I'm sure of it.
He ordered more servings beforehand.



...Our eyes meet.

Kotomine stares at me with oppressive eyes and...
"Do you want some?"
"No."
I answer him with a straight face.

I leave Ensaikan: Taizan.
...It's because Kotomine had no intention of talking anymore and started eating the mapo tofu.

As I leave the restaurant with a heartburn...
"Emiya. I have withdrawn from the war, but you and Rin are still Masters. Zouken is insidious, so be careful."
...The priest warns me as if it is someone else's problem.
"......"
It's almost four o'clock when I get out of the restaurant.
I have no business in the shopping district, so all that's left is to go home, but...

"Matou Zouken... Shinji and Sakura's grandfather, huh?"
I have a bad feeling about this.
I don't feel like going straight home, so I decide to take a detour.
Not enough love!

Hi, everyone, long time no see. How are you doing?
We're starting Tiger Dojo part III!

Well. This dead end is caused by lack of love!
You're forced to come to this dead end if this certain heroine's affection point is not past a certain value.

If you came to this dead end, it means you were not kind enough!

For example... this is only for argument's sake, but I don't know about leaving a sick girl alone to go walking about at night.

It might be good to restart from day 6 with that in mind.
Well, I'll be waiting for you in the next Tiger Dojo!
"......"
It's almost four o'clock when I get out of the restaurant.
I have no business in the shopping district, so all that's left is to go home.

  ", "

...But Kotomine's story is not something I can ignore.
Caster is still alive.
People are still falling into unexplained comas.
And

  "...! , !"

I'm still surprised by how calm I was when I found out Kotomine was a Master.
...Come to think of it, I never got along with him.
I must have known instinctively that we would be in opposition.

  "...Hey!"

...In any case, Kotomine lost his Servant.
There are three Masters remaining now.
Assassin's Master, who seems to be at the Ryudou Temple, and Archer's Master, Tohsaka.
And...

"HEEEEEEEEEEY!
 WHY ARE YOU SPACED OUT, SHIROU!!!!!?"

"Whoaaaa!?"
Berserker's Master, the girl in front of me right now!

"I-Ilya...!? W-Why did you suddenly jump on me!? You surprised me...!"
"Hey, it wasn't sudden! You're the one who didn't notice me when I was calling out to you!"

"What...?"
...Oh.
I thought I heard something, but could it be...?

"...Oh man. Have you been following me ever since the shopping district?"
"Yup. You were walking with a difficult expression.
 I called to you from behind so that I wouldn't bother you, but you just ignored me and kept on walking."

"Oh.  Well, I was thinking, so it's not like I was ignoring you..."
"And you didn't come to the park either. I was waiting all this time."

Oh... she's right.
We have a tacit understanding to meet there in the afternoon.
How could I have forgotten just because I was talking with Kotomine!?

"...Sorry, I forgot about it. I apologize, Ilya."
"Humph. I won't forgive you that easily. I'm really mad."

Ilya glares at me.
...Hmm, what should I do?
I can't blame her for getting mad, since I did forget our promise and make her wait.

I have to show her my sincerity, so
...Yeah.
I made her wait out here in the cold, so the least I can do is help her warm up again.

"I have a proposition, Ilya."
"What? I won't fall for cheap words."

"Right. That's why I'm going to apologize to you with my actions instead.
 Do you want to come to my house? I can treat you to some hot tea and snacks."

"Huhyou mean your house!?"
"Where else? There's no one homewell, Saber's home, but I won't let her attack you.
 I think drinking tea at home is good once in a while."

"Hm... It might be good, but... Can I really go to your house?"

"Of course. Besides, you showed me your castle the other day. It's my turn today."
"......Yeah. You did say that."
She sounds like she's trying to convince herself.

Then...

"Can I really go to your house? I came to kill you and Kiritsugu. Can such a person be allowed to enter your house?"
Ilya asks me emotionlessly.


I don't know how much meaning was put into those words.
The Einzbern girl who came to kill my father.
Her reason for pursuing Kiritsugu, her reason for wanting to kill me...
...These things I already know.

The man that betrayed Einzbern.
Kiritsugu abandoned everything and started living in this town.
I didn't know about all the sacrifices that made this life possible until I became a Master.

Ilya should not forgive Kiritsugu, and she really must want to kill me.
 I should invite her to my house despite that fact... no, more so because.

"Yeah. This Master business doesn't matter right now. I just want you to come over."
I answer her while looking straight into her eyes.


Ilya gasps, looks at me in astonishment, and...
"Okay! Thanks, Onii-chan!"
She hugs me with a big smile.

"All right. Stay here for a bit, Ilya. I have to go convince Saber."
I roll up my sleeves and glare at the entrance.

"Okay, go ahead, Shirou! Good luck!"
Ilya waves her hand and cheers me on.
All right!
I have to persuade Saber no matter what.

"I refuse."
Well, that didn't take very long.

"! Well, I understand how you feel. I know what you want to say.
 You want to tell me it's suicidal to invite Berserker's Master into our house, right? I understand, I really do. But set that aside for a moment"

"No, you do not understand! It is Ilyasviel we are talking about! A Master of her degree should easily be able to detect the weakness of this place!  It should be easy for her to destroy the boundary field! But you want to invite her in!? This is not just inviting in your enemy! You are about to drink poison out of your own will!"

"...B-But Ilya promised me she wouldn't do anything. And she doesn't have Berserker with her. She said we won't fight until nighttime. Ilya's just a girl, so don't get angry about such a trifling matter."

"Her gender does not matter! First of all, what were you doing with Ilyasviel behind my back!? You were almost killed by her. And you are showing concern for her? You are not good-natured, but just plain stupid!"

"Ugh... But Ilya's a good girl once you get to know her.
 She just doesn't know good from evil, so we merely have to teach her what's good and bad..."

"You are too optimistic! Are you simply taking her at her word, Shirou!? Her family exists only to obtain the Holy Grail. She will break her promises to you without a second thought!"

"...! T-That's not true! You're going too far, Saber. Ilya is Ilya. I don't know what these Einzbern people are like, but don't treat her like them!"

"...... That is certainly true. You are correct, Shirou."
"! Saber, then..."
"Well, it did not sound convincing when you suggested it in such a quiet voice."

"Uh, um..."
...Well, it's just that Saber was that mad.

"...I understand. If I continued to protest, you would likely use your Command Spell. I shall trust her, as you have trusted her."
"Saber."

"But I will not see her. I do not think I can stay composed in front of her, and I am sure she will be on guard if I am there."

"Y-Yeah, you're right. Then what are you going to do?"
"I shall stand by in the guest room. I shall quickly come to you in case of an emergency, so please do not worry."

"...Okay. I'm sorry, Saber, but this is..."
"I know. I am the one who told you about Kiritsugu and the Holy Grail War. I should have been prepared for this."
Saber lets out a sigh and goes to the guest room.


...I see.
Saber was my father's Servant in the last Holy Grail War.
Thenit's natural for her to know of the relationship between Kiritsugu and Ilya.

"Hello. So this is Shirou's house."
In contrast to her energetic voice, Ilya enters timidly.

"Let's have some tea first. I'll show you the living room, so follow me."
"Okay. Oh, this hallway has a wooden floor. Your house is Japanese, just like I heard."
Ilya looks around as she walks.

"......"
I guess this Japanese-style is unusual for her since she's living in a castle.

"Here you go. I thought about making English tea, but that's boring and I'm sure you have better ones at your place. I made some Japanese tea, so tell me if it's too bitter and I'll water it down for you."

I hand her the cup.
I used the best tea I had, so it should taste good. The only potential problem is that it might be too bitter.

"Oh, thanks, Shirou."
She sits Japanese-style and nervously takes a sip.

"Uh..."
Ilya freezes.
...I thought so. I was trying to be considerate, but I guess milk tea would've been better.

"I'm sorry. It's bitter, right? I'll go make another one, so you don't have to drink it."
"Ehno, that's not true. Um, it was very delicious."

I don't know where she learned the manners, but Ilya bows.
And she slowly starts to sip on the tea.

"......"
...Well, if she wants to drink it, I shouldn't stop her.
The Japanese snack, on the other hand...

...Seems to be well-received, so I'll sit here and keep her company.

Once we finish the tea, Ilya asks me if we can explore my house.

"I'm fine with that, but there's nothing interesting."
"I just want to check it out. I knew this place had low magical value when I came in here, so all you have to do is show me around."

That's her reply.
So I end up giving her a tour of my home, but...

"Hmm. This place is smaller than I thought. One side of the corridor is glass. It'll be troublesome when you get attacked here."

"This is Shirou's room!? No way, a person can't live here!"

"This is your yard? Japanese magi must have it tough. You can't grow anything in such a small garden."

"I know this. This is called a dojo, right?
 My grandfather told me you people are savages that slash at each other bare-footed."

"No! I don't want to see inside your storage room! You have servants to take care of that!"

...She complains a lot.
But it seems she's having fun.

"What's next!? We haven't gone over there! Let's go, Shirou!"
She urges me.

"...Fine, fine. Then let's go to the back. It's dirty because we haven't used it for a few years, but don't worry about it."
Ilya runs across the hallway in joy.

"Phew."
But...
I don't know what she's so happy about, but I'm glad I'm showing her around if it's this fun for her.

But.
Ilya must be getting tired, as she loses her spirit halfway through the tour.
Ilya silently looks around the rooms.
Once we've seen everything, we return to the living room.

"That's all. Well, there's also the outbuilding, but you'll have to excuse me for not showing it to you.
 Saber is sleeping there right now."
Ilya looks downcast.

"I see. So this is all?"
"...Ilya? What's wrong? Are you tired?"

"Yeah, I'm a bit tired. There's nobody here, after all."
She looks like a normal girl of her age.

...Ilya is acting like Ilya, and not like a strong Master.
"I came to take revenge. But it's sad that the person to take revenge on isn't here anymore."
She murmurs to herself, tears silently trickling down her face.

"Huh? That's strange. I think I'm crying. There was nothing sad or scary."
Ilya tilts her head in wonder, as if it's a really odd thing.


There's probably a reason for it.
There's no one in this house.
The target she has a grudge against.
She only wanted to kill him, but the chance has been forever lost.
...Ilyasviel von Einzbern.
She has a reason to kill me and Kiritsugu.
It's because

"Let's go, Shirou. The sun's going to set soon.
 We'll have to fight unless I leave this place before nightfall."
...Ilya is smiling.
What can I say back to her?

"Yeah, you're right. Then I'll see you off to the park."
"Okay. You sure know how to treat a lady."
She smiles innocently.
Her silver hair fluttering behind her, Ilya runs to the front door as if nothing has happened.

...And I part with her for the third time.
My legs are heavy on the way home.
I slowly walk through the streets, as if for the first time.


I have so much to think about.
Foremost in my mind...  I'm finally realizing how important Ilya is.

"...Father. Ilya is"
Should I fight her as a Master?
Or should I convince her to forfeit?

'Makiri and Einzbern have deep tenacities.
 They have desired the Holy Grail for over 500 years and 1000 years.'

That's what Kotomine said.
Is there a way to separate Ilya from people who have sought the Holy Grail for so long?
...No, even before that.
I have no idea how to quench her desire for revenge.

I return to my house.
The sun is about to set, coloring the town with its reddish glow.

"All right. I have to pull myself together."
I slap my cheeks.
I'll have to deal with Shinji and Ilya sooner or later, but defeating Caster, the one still attacking the people in this town, takes priority now.

I won't let an event like the one that took place ten years ago take place again.
That's why I decided to become a Master and fight alongside Saber.
As long as I've broken my promise with her, all my explanations will be excuses.
I have to do something to earn her forgiveness, but I don't know what will please her.
Thenwhy don't I do anything she wishes, like a Servant under a Command Spell?

"Why are you silent? I won't be deceived by that face. I'm not going to apologize if you're not either. If you don't like me, then I'll"

"I've decided. A Servant. I'll be your Servant just this once in compensation for breaking my promise."
"...Turn you into a doll... Wait, a Servant!?"

"Yeah. There's nothing I can do that will keep my promise, right? So I'll obey you just once. Wouldn't that make you feel a bit better?"

"
 No, you're lying! You didn't come to the park. A verbal promise ends right away, so I won't trust your words."

"I know. That's why I'm going to obey you, like you used a Command Spell. You'll only be able to use it once, but I won't break my promise with you, no matter what. Will you trust me if that's the case?"

"T-Trust you...? But I don't have a Command Spell I can use against you..."

"No, but I'll keep my promise. There's no contract or Command Spell, but I'll treat it like an order from a Command Spell.
 We're both Masters. I swear on my Crest that I won't betray something I recognize as a Command Spell."

I swear while looking Ilya in the eyes.
The silver-haired girl gasps and...
"...Will you really do anything I say?"
...Stares back at me uneasily.

"Of course. It's a Command Spell we're talking about. I'll do anything, as long as it's possible for me to do."
I reply to her wary gaze with a big smile.

"......"
A long silence.
Ilya averts her eyes and clenches her fists.

"......Okay. Then, I want......"
"Huh...?"
Did I mishear her?
It's a Command Spell we're talking about here, but her wish is a small one.

"Ilya...? Hold on, it's a Command Spell. I'm going to do anything you say. Are you sure that's all you want?"

"......"
"Don't you have anything else? That's too easy. You don't have to hold back, so give me a better"
"I-I'm not holding back! You liar! You said you'd do anything!"

"Uh, but... is that really all you want!? Because such a trifling matter..."
...It's something I'd easily be able to do, even without a Command Spell forcing me.

"...It's not trivial. I've always wanted to do something like that. So that's what I want from you right now, Shirou."
Her face is all red, and she's trembling out of fear of getting rejected.

"Ilya."
There's no way I can question her now.
No matter how trivial it may be, it's her wish.
ThenI have to protect her as her knight.

"All right. I'm sorry for saying such a stupid thing.
 Let's go, Ilya. It's a small shopping district, but it should be fun with the two of us."

I can feel my face heating up as I say the embarrassing words.
My face is turning red.
But I hold my hand out to Ilya without trying to hide it.

Ilya's wish really is trivial.
'Take me shopping.'
It's not a big wish.
She asked for an everyday event.

...I don't know how much meaning her wish held for her.
We walk through the shopping district not like Masters, but like siblings.
Ilya runs through the familiar scenery with lit up eyes.

Seeing her high spirits lifts my own.
Ilya walks on with a carefree smile.
Her merry attitude makes me wish this time would last forever.

But I finally realize.
She runs as if dancing, never ceasing her smile.
But there's no happiness there.
She's smiling desperately because she's sadand because she doesn't want this dream to end.

"Come over here, Shirou! The coffee's gonna get cold!"
A hot can must be interesting for her, as she runs to the park with both our drinks in hand.

The end comes, no matter how much I wish for this not to end and no matter how much I bite my lips for her to not push herself.
The shopping district here is small.
No matter how slowly we take it, we can work our way through the whole place in about an hour.

"We're here! We're at the final station.
 You can rest now, Shirou. Thanks for all the work until now."

Ilya turns to me.
I sit down on the bench, thinking that she must want to rest here.

...But.
Even though she suggested it, Ilya does not sit down.

"Ilya? Aren't you sitting down?"
"Here's your drink, Shirou. You get coffee, and I get sweet red-bean soup."

Ilya takes my drink from her pocket and hands it to me.
...The only item she asked me to buy her was her drink.

"But how did you know about sweet red-bean soup? They don't have it back home, right?"
"Right. It's the first time I've ever seen it. I was told I shouldn't be able to drink it because it's too sweet."

Ilya takes a step, smiling.
She twirls to the middle of the park.

"Ilya...?"
"I'll lift the Command Spell here. It was only a short while, but thanks, Shirou."
Her voice is clear.
Smiling resolutely, Ilya announces that her dream has come to an end.

"Wha'thanks'? Why? It hasn't even been an hour yet. We can go to Shinto if you're bored with the shopping district. That place is far better than..."

"It's fine. This is the last stop, after all. It was fun, but the shopping ends here. The sun's going to set soon, so let's go back to our previous relationship.
 I'm a Master who came to kill Shirou, and you're fighting me for your own good. Our relationship was set in stone before we met."

How can I respond to that?
Ilya yearns for ordinary life more than me, but she casts away her wishes far more readily.

"I see. Then when we leave this park..."
"Yes, we'll be enemies. If we meet again during nighttime, we'll have to continue the fight.
 If you don't want me to kill you, you'll have to kill me first."

I stop my breath for a second and look up at the sky.
The sky is gray.
The happy time quickly ended, and the town is covered with a heavy canopy.
 Even though I wished for this time to last forever, I knew it was going to end like this when I realized this is only a painful experience for Ilya.

The girl said this the farthest end.
The final station.
Ilya keeps smiling innocently in this place without destination or backtrack.

"Wow! It's snowing, Shirou!"
Her lively voice catches my attention.
A distant scenery is in front of me when I look back at the park.

I doubt for a second, thinking it's an illusion.
It's not because of the snow, but because of the dancing girl.


The snow must be temporary.
It looks like it'll stop soon.

...Within the indistinct winter, Ilya is completely surrounded in white snow.
The silver-haired girl is playing in the temporary snow as if loved by winter.

"Aha, the snow in this town is warm. This is the first time I've seen normal snow."
I don't know what's so fun, but Ilya keeps twirling around.

"You're energetic. Do you like snow, Ilya?"
"Yeah. I don't like cold things, but I like the snow. It's kind and like my mom. I was praised that my hair is white and feminine."

She makes a big smile.
By watching her, I can tell who praised her.

"It's beautiful. So it snows in the land Kiritsugu used to live in, huh?"

Her smile isn't directed at me.
...Ilyasviel von Einzbern.
The white girl that came to kill my father.
Why she was after Kiritsugu, why she wants to kill me...
...These things I already know.

The man that betrayed Einzbern.
Kiritsugu abandoned everything and started living in this town.
I, an unrelated child, pursued him as his son.
I didn't learn about all the sacrifices that made this life possible until I became a Master.

The snow keeps falling as if to hide Ilya.
The girl from a distant foreign country says goodbye with a smile.

"Good-bye, Shirou. I'll play with you again if I ever see you walking around alone!"

The white girl leaves the park with an innocent smile.

As though her presence was what sustained it, the snowfall slackens and dies.
A temporary illusion.
I brush off the snow crystals that never had a chance to pile up and leave the station of the farthest end.
It can't be helped if I forgot about it. I'll have her forgive me.

"I'm sorry. I met somebody who I didn't expect, and I forgot all about our promise. I'll be more careful next time, so please forgive me."
I bow my head in apology.

"...I see. You try to cover for yourself with simple words? I thought you were different from Kiritsugu, but you're the same after all."
"EhIlya?"

"No, that makes it even more fun for me. I'll turn you into my toy, just as I planned."
"...!?"

I feel a chill.
Ilya's eyes emit murderous intent, just like the night we met for the first time.

"See you again, Onii-chan. I'll let you go today, but you'll have to be careful the next time we meet."
Without waiting for a response, she turns and dashes off.
"Hey, Ilya...!"

I run after her, but I lose sight of her.

"...I guess I angered her."
...I failed.
I should've put more thought into it before I apologized to her.

"Man. Either way, I have to come up with a plan before I see her again."
I don't want to be on bad terms with Ilya.
I'll come up with some way to make it up to her
"Huh?"
I see Sakura's shoes.
Considering the time, I bet Sakura's already back from her club.

"I'm home... Oh. You're asleep, Sakura?"
Her club practice must have been tiring, as Sakura is sleeping in the living room.
She must be exhausted, as she is lying on the floor rather than having her head on the table.

"...Yeah. She was sick, but she went to school and her club, and helped around with my house on top of that. You're working way too hard, Sakura."
I go past the living room, trying not to wake her up.
And...
I bring a blanket from my room.

"Here. You'll catch cold again if you sleep without a blanket."
I carefully drape the blanket over her.
Then.

"Hm... Sen... pai..."
She must be half asleep, as Sakura looks up at me with empty eyes.

"!"
Her gesture... is different.
It's not the Sakura I know who stands and smiles in the kitchen wearing an apron. Umher gesture is more erotic than I've ever seen on her.

"I-I brought a blanket, Sakura"
Nervously, I try to explain myself.
At that instant
Sakura's arms wrap around my neck.


Her breath is near me.
I'm intensely aware of her femininity, no matter how hard I try to ignore it.

"HeySakura"
I can't breathe or talk properly.
Sakura is half-asleep.
You need only look at her eyes to see that.
So I have to shake her off me. I have to get away from her, but

"Ahuh."
I can't take my eyes off of her.

...Her hair streams down her neck.
Her lips let out a seductive sigh, and her breasts are pushing up her shirt.
Having her mature woman's body so close is making me dizzy.

"Sen... pai..."
Her hands tense up a bit.
...Our faces near each other.
I'm entranced by her lips, unable to resist.


My reasoning is frozen.
Everything I've prohibited, everything I shouldn't have noticed... such boring senses are being destroyed.

"Sa... kura..."
My heart is pounding.
The sound of the pounding heart fills my eardrums, my head empties out, and

"Are you home, Shirou?"
"UWAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"

I jump back.
I display speed and quick-wittedness I've never shown before and land on top of the table...!

"That was a wonderful movement. But I do not know about landing on the table."
"You're right. I was a bit surprised."
I slowly step down to the floor.
Sakura is

"Hm... Hmm..."
Her hands are lowered, and she's sleeping again.

"Shirou? Your face is red. Did something happen? Your eyes are wandering. Are you worried about something?"
"I-It's nothing! Let's just go to the dojo. Sakura needs sleep, and I want to train with you until dinner."

"That is an excellent attitude to take, Shirou. I am well rested and in perfect condition. Let us prepare for tonight's battle."
Saber heads to the dojo without questioning my suspicious behavior.

"Phew."
I-I'm saved.
I'm glad Saber didn't see us like that, but I'm more glad that I didn't do anything on the spur of the moment.
...If I'd done anything to Sakura while she was half-asleep, I would kill myself out of shame.
The moon darkens.
The clouds, blown by the strong wind, hide the white moon.

We go outside, careful not to wake Sakura.
It's eleven o'clockwe decided to start patrolling earlier to make up for yesterday.

The town has continued to suffer while my guard was down after Caster's defeat.
If Caster is still alive and collecting energy from people, I have to defeat her for sure tonight.

We descend the hill to the intersection.
The question is where to go from here

"Shirou. I feel a Servant's presence."
"...! Is it close, Saber?"
"It should not be a problem distance-wise. Even with your speed, we should be able to catch up to the Servant in about five minutes.
 Please give me an order, Master."

Saber is asking me if we should follow them or stay here and keep watch.
I don't even need to think about it.

"Let's go. Lead the way, Saber."
Saber starts to run.
She heads eastit seems she is heading to the big bridge connecting Miyama City and Shinto.

"......!"
The instant I step into the park, the abnormal presence makes me feel like vomiting.
The air is polluted here.
The stench of rot and decay seeps into my nose.

"Uh... guh."
My gastric juice is regurgitated just by standing here.
The discomfort and the dizziness almost break my mind.

"Look, Shirou!"
"......!"
I suppress my nausea and look.
There

"E-Emiya-kun...!?"
"...Saber."
...Stand Tohsaka and Archer, with their backs to us...

"Hm? New enemies?"
...And that old manMatou Zouken.


I understand the situation right away.
Tohsaka is fighting Matou Zouken.

I see dozens of something so small that I can't distinguish it around Tohsaka.
Tohsaka's Servant Archer has many more around him.
It seems Matou Zouken used those things to attack them.

"Hm. Well, if it isn't Saber's Master.
 So you've prepared a backup?  For Tohsaka's daughter, you are surprisingly smart."

"You're wrong. Archer and I are more than enough to beat a confession out of you.
 They're just spectators. They have nothing to do with me."
Tohsaka keeps glaring at Matou Zouken.

...But her back is...
"What were you thinking, coming at a time like this!? Do you want to die!?"
...Harshly scolding me.

"Shirou."
"...I know. This isn't the time to be arguing with Tohsaka."
Just as how Tohsaka does not look away from that old man, I'm feeling danger from him.

...A monster said to have survived by sucking people's blood.
A descendant of Makiri who tried to obtain the Holy Grail and made Shinji into a Master.
There's no way such a guy would just stand there and not do anything.

"Hm. I wanted to keep this hidden, but I guess it cannot be helped. I cannot survive against two Servants."

He makes a sound with his cane.
The instant it strikes the bricks beneath the old man's feet...

...Someone we already defeated appears to protect him.

"Caster...! Damn, so she really is still alive...!"
"Please stay back, Shirou. That is Caster, but not Caster. ...Her appearance and abilities are the same, but I do not feel her will or her soul.
 That thing is an imitation made from Caster's corpse."

Saber steps forward.
In her hand is the invisible sword.

"Oh. As expected from Saber. You saw through my trick right away. Oh my, no wonder Shinji's Rider was no match for you.
 Archer should not be a match against you, just like Caster, who was defeated without being able to do anything."

"Is that all you have to say for yourself?
 Deceiving us is the least of your crimes.
 Even though Caster is our enemy, she is a heroic spirit chosen as a Servant. You better have an appropriate determination if you are trifling with her corpse."

"Oh. I only picked up some trash that nobody needed any longer.
 I do not mind being called a heretic for that, but you would fall lower than a brute if that is the case.
 You are the greatest Servant, after all.
 Then it is best to make you, rather than this corpse, into my slave. I shall let my worms eat you alive and have you follow this corpse's fate."

"You."
"Kakaka, why are you enraged!? Servants are merely tools! It does not matter how they are used! It is the same whether you bind them with a Command Spell or if you use them as a corpse! Then is it not for your sake to turn you into a mindless puppet!?"

The two Servants charge.
Saber and Archer charge at the laughing monster as if they planned the attack.

Two blades slice through Caster.
The match was decided from the start.

Caster cannot defeat Saber.
Even with Matou Zouken's control, that fact has not changed.
Caster's magic does not reach Saber, and Saber finishes off the enemy she defeated before.

Caster's body begins to disintegrate.
Saber stands by and watches it until the end.

To ensure that it completely disappears.
To ensure that her body will not be violated again.

"Archer...!"
It's Tohsaka's voice.
Matou Zouken has disappeared.
He sacrificed Caster in order to make his escape.
But

"Hm!?"
That is why Saber took care of Caster.

Archer ignored her completely, pursued the controller, and...
"That's it."
...Cut Matou Zouken's body in half.

"Guh"
Zouken's upper body falls to the ground.

"Hm, ugh, my!"
A dragging sound.
Even though blood and entrails are spilling from his bisected body, the old man still lives.
He crawls across the ground with his arms, trying to get away from Archer.

"This is the end, magus. My past experiences have taught me to quickly finish off monsters like you."

Archer raises his shortsword above Zouken.
This is the end.
No matter how immortal Matou Zouken may be, he will die once his head is crushedand he is almost dead already.

It is not like he has self-healing powers like the Servants, and his horrific wound is taking him closer to death by the second.
But, unwilling to take any chances, Archer kills the magus with his shortsword.

"What?"
No, he tries to kill Zouken and stops.


It's not only Archer who felt it.
Everybody here does.
Tohsaka and Saber.
Archer and I.
Even Matou Zouken, hovering on the edge of death, trembles at its appearance.

Darkness covers the park.

The damp air freezes in an instant.
My heart is beating at a higher pitch, but the rate is slower.
Something bad is close by.
So I have to run away.
I can't concern myself with that thing.
My body understands it instinctively, yet it refuses to move.

It's meaningless to run away.
My body knows that I can't escape.


I move my trembling body and turn my numb neck.
I look towards the entrance of the park.
There...
...Stands the "shadow".


Space is distorted.
I want to believe it's just my imagination, a product of the disordered sense of balance caused by extreme tension.

I've never seen anything like it.
It's insubstantial, as if a shadow suddenly stood up.
Its existence is so light that it could be blown away.

And yet, its presence dominates this place.

It lacks intelligence or reason, and it probably is not even alive.
The black shadow stands there like a mirage.
So...

  Why do I find it so familiar?

"Impossible"
I hear a hoarse voice.
The only one able to speak here happens to be the dying old man.

"Impossible, impossible, impossible!"
He crawls while screaming.
Matou Zouken pulls himself away from Archer and out of the park.

...It's not that Zouken had that much strength left.
It's just that...
Fear of the shadow drove him.


Nobody is able to move.
Tohsaka and I stand still, transfixed by fear.
Even Saber and Archer seem entranced.

It's like a deep sea monster.
The shadow sways in the silent world where everything is still.

And...
It shows something like a will for the first time.

"Ah"
It lacks eyes, limbs, or a body.
Yet it still casts a shadow at its base.
Outlined by the moonlight, the shadow begins to stretch and elongate.
Like a snake that has found its prey, it points at Tohsaka and


Oblivious to the change, Tohsaka does not move.
Saber is too far away. Archer has started running, but he is too far away to make it in time.

"Toh"
The shadow lashes out.
Without showing any sign, the shadow abruptly covers tens of meters and...

"saka, watch out...!!!!!"
I frantically push Tohsaka aside.

"     -kun...!?"
I can't hear her voice.
The instant I push Tohsaka away, something engulfs me.
A splashing sound and a sensation of something trying to crush my body.

", Ah."

My presentiment wasn't wrong.
Water has come crashing in around me, and I am now sinking into the sea.

But it's hot.
This seawater is too hot.
Boiling coal tar.
It sticks to my skin and cuts off my life, and I don't feel like I'm in the sea.

"Ahguh."
I feel sick.
I feel sick, it's wrong, I feel sick, it's wrong, I-I-I-I-I feel sick, it's wrong, I feel sick, i-i-i-it's wrong, I fEEl SiCK, iT'S wRoNg, I FEel sIcK iT'S WrOnG, I FeEL SIcK iT's wROnG I feEl siCk...!!!
Rabbit's corpse. One eye missing. Rotten, soft, and fresh. Forced into my mouth. Rabbit's corpse smears my esophagus. A clear sensation of eating a life. Life is life, even if it is rotten. It's real. I can't taste this with cooked food. It feels good. There's no taste. But I'm forced to eat it as long as it is in front of me. A popular place. A big line. A place that will eat rabbits. There is only one clerk. The line consists of rabbits. Lines and lines. They rot as soon as they get in the line. Infested with maggots. Which is rotten? Which is infested with maggots? Which is alive? Which is doing the eating
My body is melting.
         My mind is melting.
           My soul is melting.

"Agh"
The black fingers wrap around me.
It tries to eat abundantly and greedily, without the slightest opening.
"Ah"
My body falls into a sea of black mud.
The surface is far away, and I sink without end.
It reinforces and embraces me, carefully and without exception.


My limbs disappear.
My body turns black, and I become a part of it and fall downward to my final destination.
"......Kun, Emiya-kun...!"
"Agh... gu."
I wake up.

...My body is hot.
My nausea isn't fading, my head is shaking, and I can't even stand up by myself.

"Are you awake!? Can you tell who I am...!?"
She slaps my cheeks.

"...I can tell. Only Tohsaka would slap someone at a time like this."
"Good. I guess you're all right if you can talk back like that."
...That was just my honest opinion right now.

"You idiot, why are you smiling? ...I'm not going to thank you, okay? Don't ever do that again. I can't return the favor if you die trying to save me."

...She glares at me.
But Tohsaka is still rubbing my back with one hand and holding my hand in the other to check my temperature.

"...Tohsaka. What happened to that weird thing?"
"It disappeared. It vanished when you stepped onto the shadow and fainted. ...I think it came from over that way."

Tohsaka looks southwest and grits her teeth.

"...I see. But I think I was entangled in it for a while."
"...Really? It hasn't even been ten seconds since you pushed me. Here's the proof, see."

"Shirou...!"
Saber runs up to me.
"You acted reckless again...!"
Saber supports me and pulls me away from Tohsaka.

"Get away, Archer's Master. I shall treat you as an enemy if you come any closer to my Master."
"What? I'm your enemy as well?"

"Of course. You are a Master, and Archer is with you.
 I do not know why Shirou protected you, but I cannot let you near my Master before my eyes."

Saber glares at Tohsaka.
...Crap, I guess I never told Saber about our current truce.

"...No, you're wrong, Saber. We're at peace right now, so until we defeat Caster"
"Shirou!? Please get yourself together...!"
"...I'm saying Tohsaka isn't our enemy. I promised her."

"......! Understood. I will not fight her if that is your will."
"...Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't talk... anymore..."

I endure the nausea and the chill that tries to get me unconscious.
...I have to get home before I faint.
I have to stay conscious until then.

"So you survived, huh? Well, you didn't touch the main body, so the most that it can do is make you ill."
Archer approaches.
Archer is expressionless even though Zouken got away, and he is the only calm one here.

"...Archer. Do you know what that shadow is?"
"Who knows? But one thing is clear. That shadow is what's been draining the life from the townspeople ever since Caster's death."

...He answers as if he's not interested.
Then Archer looks down at me, lying on the ground.

"It seems this is no time to pursue personal grudges.  Isn't that right, Emiya Shirou?"
"...What?"
"As for what that shadow was, your intuition is correct.
 ...Humph. I am summoned as a Servant, but I'm to fight it after all."

"Archer...? Who are you?"
"I see. You are not a guardian yet. Then you must not have fought something like that before. ...Man, it seems I'll be doing the same thing no matter where I go."

...The knight in red beckons Tohsaka to go.
But right before they leave...

"...No, it's not that hopeless.
 It has not occurred yet. I might be able to finish it beforehand, or I might end up cleaning after the event. I have a chance of stopping it this time."
He looks up at the sky and murmurs these words.

...It switches off and on.
The heat permeates my body and I don't feel like I'm walking.

Is it because someone told me this is like a disease?
It feels like plagued maggots are filling my whole body.

"S-Senpai...!?"

...I can't tell dream and reality apart.
I feel like I'm already asleep and trying to go back to my room.

"Sakura...? Were you not asleep?"
"Please move aside. You'll hurt Senpai if you hold him like that."

"No, this is my duty.
 And if this is a disease, you might get infected as well."
"...I'm not talking about that.
 Saber-san. I don't know what you two are doing. I knew you wouldn't answer me even if I asked, so I never did."

"But Senpai has seemed troubled ever since you came here.
 ...I could still bear that, but tonight you've brought him home injured."
"Sakura, that is..."

"I don't know what your circumstances are. But isn't there a better way to go about this?
 If you can'tplease at least resolve your problems without involving Senpai."

...I return to my room.
It feels like someone is next to me, putting me to sleep.

", "

A voice is whispering in my ear, but I can't make out the words.
Did it apologize, it's my fault?
Did it apologize, I'm sorry?

Whatever the words are, they're the last thing I hear.
My consciousness fades as soon as I lie down.
The scene keeps squirming like insects until the very end.
When I wake up, my body has fully recovered.
My temperature is normal, and my limbs don't feel heavy at all.

"It's before six o'clock. I wonder if Sakura's awake?"
If she is, she'll probably be preparing breakfast.
I'd better get ready quickly and head to the kitchen, or Sakura will finish it herself.

"I'm going ahead, Saber. Come to the living room in a bit."
I don't have the guts to look inside her room, so I retreat after calling out to her.
It'll be troublesome if I see Saber sleeping.

"And my dad collapsed.
 He was like, 'your father is sick in bed, so don't you think you should settle down?'
 Isn't that rude? He makes it sound like I'm a wandering cloud."

Fuji-Nee complains while eating.
It seems Fuji-Nee didn't come over last night because her father collapsed.

"...? Senpai, what is this wandering cloud?"
"It's describing Fuji-Nee. It's an airy person without a definite character."
I answer without hesitation.

"You're wrong! A wandering cloud is an idler!
 It's what you call a person who does nothing but go around town to mock people."

Sakura and Saber nod in comprehension.
I do not even need to mention which part they agree on.

"So, Sensei. Is your father sick?"
"Of course not. My family is famous for not getting sick. My dad sumo wrestled with one of the younger guys and hurt his hips."
"Sumo...? What is this 'sumo', Taiga?"

"Huh? It's kinda hard to explain in words. It's a type of martial art where you push, push instead of pull, push and push. You can't use weapons, and you can't use a fist. You also can't kick.
 You basically grapple with your opponent and win by knocking your opponent down to the ground."

"...Hm. So is it a pure contest of power?"
"Yup. And you don't wear any clothes. You and your opponent grapple pretty much naked."

"N-Naked...!?"
"Yup. Well, your weak point is covered by a mawashi. Oh, that's a sumo wrestler's loincloth, by the way. If you don't understand, ask Shirou about it. He knows more than I do."
Fuji-Nee says something absurd as she sips on her miso soup.

"I see. So, Shirou. What is this loincloth?"

It's easy to explain, but I'm a bit hesitant to talk about it.
I'm talking to Saber, and we're eating right now.
Why do I have to talk about loincloths during a meal?

"...I don't know. Sumo is out of my area of expertise, so ask someone else."
"You're lying! You have a loincloth too!"

"I-I don't! I had to do sumo because your grandfather made me, and I only borrowed one then!
 First of all, that happened years ago!"

"Ahahaha, you're right. You kept losing because you were small back then. My gramps told you to do a different sport because you wouldn't give up until you won, so he made you start archery."

"......"
Fuji-Nee is laughing cheerfully.
...Man.
Fuji-Nee is in high spirits this morning, so she's louder than usual.

"Hey, Fuji-Nee. It's almost time. You'll be late unless you leave here before seven o'clock."
"Huh? Oh, it's fine today. Morning club activities are cancelled starting today. ...Well, I still have to leave early because there's a teachers' meeting."

"Huh? The morning practice for the archery club is cancelled as well?"
"Yup. Oh, I see. You didn't hear about it, huh? There was an incident yesterday, and some people in the track team got injured during practice. but they got injured during practice. I guess it's because of lack of sleep, so morning practices will be cancelled for a while."

"...I see. But they cancelled all the practices because of one injured person?
 Lack of sleep is that person's"
It's their own fault, unless...

"Fuji-Nee. How many people were injured?"
"...Hmm. It's between ten and twenty students."

"T-That many?
 What about the people in the archery club?"

"Well, nobody in our club got hurt, but a few people looked tired yesterday.
 ...And it's been dangerous recently, right? We can't just ignore the mental strain it might be causing, so I guess the school's trying to decrease the burden. I don't know about the clubs being a mental burden, but it's true that they physically tire you."
Fuji-Nee shrugs and holds out her bowl.

"Can I have another bowl, Sakura-chan? I just want it half-full."
"Of course. You're not eating a lot this morning, Sensei."
"Yeah. My stomach is hurting because I know there's a lot of work waiting for me at school, so I don't have any appetite."

Fuji-Nee pretends to cry.
Hmm.
It seems the tiger at my house wants us to believe that two and a half bowls of rice isn't her normal serving.

"You're full of energy in contrast, Sakura-chan. You're on your second full bowl."
"I'm still growing. I get hungry quickly, so I have to push myself and eat extra."

Sakura puffs up with pride.
...Well.
I don't know about that being part of the growing thing... But maybe all the gluttons around her are influencing her.

"I see. Sakura does not have sufficient strength as an archer. It is good to take in extra energy."
Saber nods as she keeps eating.
...Is it just me, or is she missing the original topic?
It's past seven o'clock.
Fuji-Nee left for school, and we're cleaning now.
Sakura has time as well, so we relax and do the dishes.

With the two of us, it doesn't take long.
...I was keeping an eye on Sakura because of her health, but she really seems okay now.
It looks like her fever's gone, and she's full of energy.

"U-Um, Senpai...!
 I-I have something to tell you, so could you spare me some time!?"

Then.
Sakura stammers a question, looking as nervous as if she were breaking into somebody's house.

"Sure. We still have time."
"O-Okay. ...U-Um, well. I made, um, some lunch for you..."
She looks down as she hands me a lunchbox.

It's not my usual lunchbox, and it seems Sakura prepared it for me.
It has a cute shape, and it's wrapped in vivid colors.
The taste is guaranteed if Sakura made it, and I appreciate the fact that someone made lunch for me.

"Uh, thanks. ...Wait, did you wake up early to make me lunch?"
Sakura was done with cooking breakfast when I came to the living room this morning.
I admired how early she got up, but it seems she actually woke up earlier than I thought.

"Oh, yes. Um, I woke up early, and I didn't have anything to do, so I thought I'd make lunch. ...Um, and I want to ask you about something"
"...? Why are you all formal? Do you need to consult me about something important?"

"N-No, it's nothing big...!
 It's not, but...... umm... oh, yes! S-Senpai, you don't make lunch that often. You like cooking, so I'm wondering why!"
"...Sakura. It's not like I like to cook."

I don't know about a guy's hobby being cooking, so I wish she'd keep it as something I can do.
Oh, wait. We're talking about why I don't make my own lunch.

"Well. I know it's cheaper to make my own lunch. But the guys in my class crowd around it if I do make it. Half my lunch is taken away before I know it."

Sakura nods in satisfaction.
...To be accurate, it's the girls that take most of my lunch, but I don't say it because it's too pathetic.

"Yeah, so I only make lunch when I can use the student council room. Then, I can eat alone with Issei."

"...U-Um, Senpai? How about eating at the archery range in that case?
 It's open during lunchtime, I can make you some tea, and it's quiet there"

...?
Oh, that's a good idea.
The archery range isn't locked, and the club members rarely go there during lunchtime.
Mitsuzuri might be there, but she's not so cruel as to eat someone else's lunch.

"...Yeah, you're right. That's a good idea."
"Y-Yes!
 It is a good idea! Then, um"
"But I don't know about an outsider going in there. I guess we have to ask Mitsuzuri for permission."

"I-It's all right! The archery range is part of the school, so any student should be able to use it when the archery club isn't using it!"
Sakura presses her point.

"...Hmm, you're right. I guess it's fine if I'm not causing anyone trouble."
I nod to myself.
Then.
I don't know why, but Sakura is making a victory pose with a big smile.

"...?"
...Hmm. Maybe some of Fuji-Nee's energy transferred to Sakura.
"WhaCaster hasn't disappeared?"
"Correct. You defeated Caster two days ago, right?
 But the coma incidents happened again yesterday.
 ...The people who had their magical energy sucked out yesterday are in a worse coma than before."

"No way. We definitely..."
"I know. You wouldn't lie, and I don't think you made a misunderstanding. ...But Archer and I saw a shadow that looked like Caster when we went to the scene of the crime yesterday."

"......I see. Then Caster's still alive and collecting magical energy from all over town?"

"...I'm not certain, but it seems so. But I can tell that the atmosphere at the Ryudou Temple has changed.
 You two defeated Caster. But she still exists. That's all I'm sure of right now."

Tohsaka looks unhappy.
...This explains why she feels different from yesterday.

Tohsaka is probably getting doubts about this war.
A Servant disappears if its Master is defeated.
A Servant cannot avoid death in this world if it is completely defeated.
But Caster still exists, in spite of taking both these penalties.
She is a "violation" that completely overthrows the fundamentals of the Holy Grail War.

"I see. So, what do you think?"
"Huh? Me?"

"Yeah. You think it's strange, right?
 I don't think you'll forfeit from the Holy Grail War. But don't you want to clear up this thing about Caster before you start fighting for the Holy Grail? You want to put off fighting other Masters until after that, right?"

"You're right.
 This Holy Grail War is suspicious. It seems different from the one I heard about from my dad. I think there's something different going on where we can't see it."

...Different, huh?
I don't have the liberty to think about such a thing because the Holy Grail War itself is beyond my comprehension.
But if a legitimate Master like Tohsaka feels that way, it must be true.

"Then Tohsaka..."
"Yes. I won't follow the rules of the Holy Grail War until I'm convinced. It can't be helped if I'm being used, but I don't like not knowing the harm I may be imposing on others.
 You don't like such a thing, right? So I'm not going to be fighting other Masters until I get this cleared up."

She declares her stance.
Tohsaka's eyes show her determination, and it seems to be asking for my stance.

"I see. Can I take that as a truce offer?"
"If you would accept it. If you won't fight me until this case is settled, I won't hurt you either."

Tohsaka asks me silently with her eyes.
She doesn't even need to ask.

"That's my line. I won't fight you as long as you don't come attacking me.
 ...And even if there comes a time when we do fight, it'll be fair and square. Until then"
I want to cooperate with Tohsaka.

"Then it's decided. I expected you to agree, but I'm glad to hear it all the same."
"Huh...?"
Tohsaka holds out her right hand.
I realize that she's wanting to shake hands, and...
"Y-Yeah. P-Please give me your best regards."
I try to suppress my face from turning red as I shake her hand.

"All right, our contract is set. Please give me your best regards too, Emiya-kun."

...Tohsaka firmly shakes my hand.
Her hand is soft, much more delicate than mine.
"!"
I-I'M AN IDIOT!!! WHAT THE HELL AM I THINKING AT A TIME LIKE THIS!!!!?

"...? What's wrong, Emiya-kun? You're sweating all of a sudden. ...It seems your heart's beating faster too."
"...!? N-No, it's nothing, I just have a cold. I'll get well if I eat! I'll get better if I eat, so let's eat lunch!"

I quickly let go of Tohsaka's hand.
Then.
Tohsaka's expression turns wicked.

"Ohhhh. I suspected it when we last met, but it looks like my hunch was correct. You seemed like you had some experience, but you actually don't, huh?
 It's surprising, or should I say it's just as I expected?
 ...I see, I see. I seeeeee."

Tohsaka Rin stares at me from head to toe.

"W-What? Come out and say it if you want to say something. I-It's not good to stay quiet!"
"Noooothing. Don't worry. It's just that I just figured out a bit more about you. Oh, I won't say it, so you don't have to be frightened."

"...! I-I'm not frightened! Go ahead and say it if you want to!"
"Oh, can I?"
She grins.
Manhow can such an evil smile exist in this world?

"...Don't say it."
"What, I can't hear you?"

"...I'm sorry. Please don't mention it. I think it'll be shocking if I hear it. I think I'll suffer more damage if I hear it from you."

"Really? Then I guess I won't say it"
Tohsaka withdraws with an expression of victory.
And the instant I regain my peace of mind...
"You're the type that masturbates to the girl you like, right?"
"Hey, you said it, you devil!!!"
Wind enters the damp room.
From the opened door come two sets of footsteps.
One kicks the ground in a hurry, and the other is being dragged in.

"Come on, get started."
Thump.
A heavy sound echoes through the room.
It is the sound of Matou Shinji, the one who came to this room in a hurry, throwing in the person he brought with him.

The floor of the secret room is wriggling around.
The worms must be active right now, as leech-like insects are writhing all over the floor.
Matou Shinji knows what these worms are.
These are lust worms that his grandfather, Matou Zouken, raises that love human blood, semen, and marrow.

Once swarmed by these lust worms, men will have their spine crushed, brain sucked, and will be made into a cripple.
The worms will transform when attacking a woman, so that they are only able to violate her nerves. They will spread their tentacles all over her body and devour her spirit.

The lust worms will wet the woman's skin with their mucus, excite and destroy her central nerves of pleasure, and satisfy their hunger.
It must be their instincts, as the worms seem to love the woman's womb. They do not eat female flesh, but seek the organs within them.

They give the woman huge enough orgasms to fry her brain, and they go into her body to devour her placenta.
Unwilling to eat human flesh, the worms have only one way to get what they desire.
As a result, the woman's mind and body are completely violated and destroyed.
The name "lust worm" must come from such characteristics.

Matou Shinji throws the person he dragged here into the pool of such worms.

"Get started."
He talks from the top of the stairs.
Nobody, man or woman, can survive after being thrown into a swarm of lust worms.

But this person is an exception.
The worms slither away from the person.
Are they scared, or have they lost interest?
The worms do not approach the figure.
They merely reflect the light around the figure with their mucus.

"Make a 'book'. You still have two more left."
The only reply comes from the worms.
The darkness undulates as if liking the order.

"I'll let you go back if you do as I say. That's easier for you too, right?"
There's no reply.
The only sound in the room is the annoying cry of the worms.

"......! Look, fighting is the only way. If you oppose me any more"
Matou Shinji threatens to reveal everything.
The person on the floor trembles.
That is not allowed.
The old man who Matou Shinji calls master will not allow it.

But this person knows Shinji is not the type to follow his master's orders.
He is frantic right now.
Anyone that gets in his way is his enemy.
The old man forced him away from battle out of concern for his life, but the concern itself is an unforgivable insult to him.


A change occurs after a long silence.
A figure appears in a flash of light.
The worms flee to the corners of the room like an ebbing tide.
Even the worms understand how powerful the materialized woman is.

"Heh. About time."
Long hair and a slender, tall figure.
The one clothed all in black is the Servant called Rider.

"Let me confirm again, Shinji.
 You are using me solely for your protection. Correct?"
The black Servant asks.
She is looking up from the bottom of hell, from the preserve of worms.

"Yeah. It's dangerous out there, so I want a reliable guard."
Matou Shinji does not hide his joy of becoming a Master again and spits out words covered with lies.
"Huh?"
I see Sakura's shoes.
Considering the time, I bet Sakura's already back from her club.

"I'm home... Oh. You're asleep, Sakura?"
Her club practice must have been tiring, as Sakura is sleeping in the living room.
She must be exhausted, as she is lying on the floor rather than having her head on the table.

"...Yeah. She was sick, but she went to school and her club, and helped around with my house on top of that. You're working way too hard, Sakura."
I go past the living room, trying not to wake her up.
And...
I bring a blanket from my room.

"Here. You'll catch cold again if you sleep without a blanket."
I carefully drape the blanket over her.
Then.

"Hm... Sen... pai..."
She must be half asleep, as Sakura looks up at me with empty eyes.

"!"
Her gesture... is different.
It's not the Sakura I know who stands and smiles in the kitchen wearing an apron. Umher gesture is more erotic than I've ever seen on her.

"I-I brought a blanket, Sakura"
Nervously, I try to explain myself.
At that instant
Sakura's arms wrap around my neck.


Her breath is near me.
I'm intensely aware of her femininity, no matter how hard I try to ignore it.

"HeySakura"
I can't breathe or talk properly.
Sakura is half-asleep.
The biggest proof is her drowsy-looking eyes.
So I have to shake her off me. I have to get away from her, but

"Ahuh."
I can't take my eyes off of her.

...Her hair streams down her neck.
Her lips let out a seductive sigh, and her breasts are pushing up her shirt.
Having her mature woman's body so close is making me dizzy.

"Sen... pai..."
...Her hair streams down her neck.
Her hands tense up a bit.
...Our faces near each other.
I'm lured by her captivating lips, and I can't resist her.


My reasoning is frozen.
Everything I've prohibited, everything I shouldn't have noticed... such boring senses are being destroyed.

"Sa... kura..."
My heart is pounding.
The sound of the pounding heart fills my eardrums, my head empties out, and

"Are you home, Shirou?"
"UWAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"

I jump back.
I display speed and quick wittedness I've never shown before and land on top of the table...!

"That was a wonderful movement. But I do not know about landing on the table."
"You're right. I was a bit surprised."
I slowly step down to the floor.
Sakura is

"Hm... Hmm..."
Her hands are lowered, and she's sleeping again.

"Shirou? Your face is red. Did something happen? Your eyes are wandering. Are you worried about something?"
"I-It's nothing! Let's just go to the dojo. Sakura needs sleep, and I want to train with you until dinner."

"That is an excellent attitude to take, Shirou. I am well rested and in perfect condition. Let us prepare for tonight's battle."
Saber heads to the dojo without questioning my suspicious behavior.

"Phew."
I-I'm saved.
I'm glad Saber didn't see us like that, but I'm more glad that I didn't do anything on the spur of the moment.
If I'd done anything to Sakura while she was half-asleep, I would kill myself in shame.
"It's good that you're training, but you have to keep it moderate, Senpai! Jamming a finger is bad enough, but you've almost broken this one."
"Ouch...! Please put the bandage on slower, Sakura."

"Of course it hurts. It's natural to swell up if you leave such an injury alone. Please give up and consider this a divine punishment."

"......!"
Sakura tapes up my middle finger.
Her movements are quick and accurate. She must get lots of practice treating jammed fingers in archery club.
She's skillful, but isn't this a bit rough for Sakura?

"And you too, Saber-san.
 Couldn't you have gone easier if you're stronger than Senpai? Senpai's body is swollen all over. He won't even be able to take a bath tonight."

"Sakura. I do not mean to contradict you, but that is what Shirou wished for.
 I merely responded to his request.
 And Shirou is partly responsible for tonight's injury. He was the one who wished to train, but he was not concentrating at all."

Saber glares at me in complaint.
"Ugh"
There's not much I can say when she puts it like that.

"Eh...? Did you feel sick or something, Senpai?
 ...Um, it's not like you to go to the dojo with unclear motivation."

"Indeed. What was distracting you, Shirou? You were staring into empty space even when you were holding the shinai, and I felt no spirit in your attacks."

"...Well. That's, um..."
The cause is standing right here in front of me, but there's no way I can say that. Just thinking about it makes my heart jump

"Senpai?
 Does it still hurt somewhere...?"
Sakura looks at me with worry.

"......! N-No, I'm fine now! I just ate too much, so it'll help me out if you can make me some tea!"
I quickly move my face away from Sakura.

"Okay. Then I'll go brew some after-meal tea."
Sakura stands up to go to the kitchen.

"......Man."
...This is really bad for my heart.
Her body is engraved in my mind, and I get conscious of her whenever she comes near me.

"Are you fine with tea, Saber-san?"
"Yes. Please do not make it too hot."
Sakura promptly brews some tea.
...Her gestures are supposed to be familiar, but I feel like I'm seeing them for the first time.

"...!"
Damn, why do I keep remembering it?
There's something wrong with me, just like Saber said.
Just looking at Sakura reminds me of how she looked earlier... and her soft lips....

...This is just lust.
Sakura is an important underclassman and a family member to me.
Sowhy am I now conscious of her like this?


......Damn it.
I know. I really do.
Sakura is beautiful. I've been aware of it for quite a while now.
But in spite of that, I acted as her Senpai.

I like Sakura.
...Having her around became normal for me before I knew it, and I've found it to be a great comfort.

But it's always been a different sort of affection.
I've never wanted to embrace Sakura.
I knew she was a girl, but I never viewed her as someone of the opposite sex.

But now...
I'm beginning to think it's not that I never viewed her as a girl...
...But that I was trying not to view her as a girl.

"Senpai?"

"Here's some tea, Senpai."
"Ohyeah, thanks, Sakura."
"You're welcome. Thank you for dinner too, Senpai."

Sakura smiles happily.
...Seeing her smile makes me happy as well.
It seems she really liked the pork meatloaf with egg and vegetables.

Sakura hands the tea to Saber as well and sits down.
Saber must enjoy tea, as she receives it with satisfaction.

"Itadakimasu. ...But where is Taiga? I have not seen her around for a while."
"Huh? Oh, she just called and said she can't make it tonight. I didn't get the details, but she said she has to go visit the hospitals or something."

"I see. I wanted to ask her some questions, since she is more knowledgeable about your habits.
 ...I guess it cannot be helped. I shall wait until next time to strengthen you."

"Hm. Are you saying yesterday's and today's trainings were just the beginning?"

"Of course. The trainings up to now were to teach your body what you are able to do.
 From now on, we will train you to survive using your special characteristics."
"I see. That sounds hard."

"'Intense' would be the word to describe it.  Consider your training up to today to be a mere warmup."

"Whoa."
A-Are you serious?
I don't know if I should be thankful or not that Fuji-Nee isn't coming tonight.

"What was that sigh? This is for your own goodSakura?"
Saber looks at Sakura.

"Huh?"
I follow her gaze.
Hey

Sakura's breathing painfully.

"Sakura...!"
I run to her and shake her shoulders.

"Eh... eh, what's wrong, S-Senpai...!?"
"It's not 'what's wrong'! You were pushing yourself again"

...No, she's not.
She looks healthy, her shoulders aren't hot, and she's just looking up at me in wonder.

"Huh? Um, you looked like you were in pain."
"Oh, you're wrong. I just fell asleep."
Sakura smiles in embarrassment.

"...Don't scare me like that. I thought your cold got worse again."

"I'm sorry. I've been sleepy all day, and I fall asleep if I let my guard down."
"I see. Well, you were sleeping this afternoon too. You can go rest if you're tired. I'll clean up."

"Oh... O-Okay, you're right. I'll accept your offer and go rest now."
Sakura bows and exits the living room.
She's walking steadily, so I guess she's just short on sleep, like she said.

School ends, and I quickly head home.
Since all the after-school clubs have been cancelled, the front gate is crowded with students.
I look around, but I don't see Tohsaka.
I bet she's already heading to the Matou household.

"Senpai? Are you looking for someone?"
"Hm? No, I was just looking at the school. It's rare for everyone to go home like this, right?"

"You're right. But we can go home together because of that. Should we stop by the shopping district?"
"Yeah, let's buy stuff for dinner. Fuji-Nee can't come over for a while, so it'll be for me, you, and Saber."

We stop by the park after shopping.
There's no one here.
No children playing around.  No silver-haired girl in a coat.

"...There's no one here. Is this place not used that often?"

"I guess that's how it is. There were people here until the sun set when I was a child, but I guess it's like this now except for the holidays."
"I see. It's kind of lonely."

I agree and look up at the sky.
The evening sky.
The madder red sky without any birds looks lonely, just like the park.

"Let's go. You don't get this time off very often, so we should relax."
We leave the park.
With an energetic reply, Sakura follows after me.
School ends, and I quickly head home.
Since the after-school clubs have been cancelled, the front gate is crowded with students.

I look around, but I don't see Tohsaka.
I bet she's already heading to the Matou household.

"Sakura'snot around."
Sakura should head straight to my house since the club activities are cancelled.
But I didn't promise to go home with her, so I bet she already went home.

I walk up the empty hill.
It's already been six days since the Holy Grail War started.
The town seems to be slowly losing its liveliness.

".........Whoa."
I get dizzy as soon as I climb up the hill.
It feels like nausea.
A faint buzzing reaches my ears.

"What is this sound?"
The sound echoes on my eardrums even if I cover my ears.
I'm not hallucinating.
I can't be dizzy and be hearing this at the same time by pure chance.
If I get them at the same time, it should be intentional.

"Did something happen at the house...!?"
I shake off the dizziness and start running.
Saber's at the house.
As long as Saber's there, the enemy should have a hard time launching an ambush...!

I only see Saber's shoes at the front entrance.
"Good, Sakura's not home yet!"
Then there's no need to hesitate.
Even if we're under attack, Saber and I can deal with it...!

"Are you all right, Saber...!?"
I dash into the living room.
At that instant...

...The strength flees from my legs, and I sink to my knees.

"Wha"
I can't move my legs.
The buzzing rings my eardrums, and I lose my sense of balance.
I feel nauseous and cold.
Desperately, I fight it off, willing strength into my body...

...And realize that my Command Spell has lost its color.


My mind freezes.
The color of the Command Spell has faded away.
Before I can take in what it means...

"I've already dealt with Saber. I can't afford to have any more Servants go to their side."

I hear a familiar voice near me.


I bear the nausea and look up.

"I'm sorry, Onii-chan. I wanted to play for a bit longer, but then the situation changed. If you want to curse me, curse the imperfect Holy Grail."

The ringing in my ears invades my brain.
The imperceptible sound waves shut down my vision by filling themselves behind my eyeballs.

"But don't worry. I won't kill you right away.
 You're my trump card against that person. I'll destroy your body here, but I'll put your mind in a puppet.
 ...Teehee. You won't be able to move after that, but it's better than dying. Right, Onii-chan?"

The sound permeates my body.
My mind is still frozen.
In the darkness with my senses sealed, I meet my end without even realizing it.
The town falls asleep.
It's just past ten o'clock, but it seems like it's midnight.
It must be because of all the unexplained comas.
There are no lights, and nobody is walking about.

"Finding the shadow and investigating itArcher's Master has given us quite the reckless request."
"Yeah. But we have to do it. Are you against it, Saber?"

"...I told you my opinion this morning.
 So, do you have any clues? We might find ourselves being the target if we wander about aimlessly."

...A clue, huh?
I'm not positive, but
"Let's go to the Ryudou Temple again.
 ...I noticed that Caster was acting strange.  I think there's something there."

"...Yes. That mountain is filled with an ominous presence. The land there is the spiritual focus of this town. It is worth investigating, regardless of whether the shadow is there."

"Then it's decided. Let's go."
We walk to the gate.
We can reach the temple in an hour, if we hurry. We don't have any time to lose, but

"Saber?"
Saber is looking at the outbuilding.
She is looking at Sakura's room, where Sakura should now be sleeping.

"...Shirou. I have something to discuss with you. It follows this morning's conversation."
"...? You mean about Sakura?"

"Yes. Sakura's guilty conscience is too strong. She has a tendency of trying to atone for her sins in the present rather than the future."

...She must be talking about the quarrel they had yesterday.
Saber said Sakura was right, so Sakura had no reason to worry about it.

But Sakura said she was still at fault, went and apologized to Saber, and had Saber apologize to her instead.
Sakura and Saber.
Saber must be worried about the difference in their thought process.

"...What do you mean?"
"...Sakura places too much blame upon herself. She punishes herself for her errors instead of correcting them. She brands herself with her dishonor, rather than working to recover her honor. She burdens herself in a good way and a bad way."

...She talks with disgust.
It sounds like she's talking about herself more than about Sakura.

"...It was clear to me last night. She is special when she is with you, but I believe she behaves differently in other circumstances. Sakura is liberated from her guilty conscience only when she is with you."

That is the source of her concern.
Sakura should be able to live with pride without needing to rely on another.

"...I see. Sakura certainly is too shy. I'll be careful."
Now that Saber mentions it, it's not healthy for a girl Sakura's age to always be busy helping around the house.
She says it's fun to be here, but she should at least go outside to hang out once in a while.

"...Thanks for looking out for Sakura, Saber.
 I'm really happy that you're worried about her when she has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War."

"...No. I also have a guilty conscience, so it did not seem like someone else's business."

"Ohhold on, Saber. Let's go together."
We head to the gate together.
We head outside within the silence, trying not to wake Sakura up.
"...I say yesterday's park. They say the criminal returns to the scene of the crime"

"Are you saying the shadow will appear again?
 Master. Even if we are fortunate enough to find the shadow there, what would we do? It would be nice if we could defeat it there, but it will become harder to find that shadow if we let it escape. I believe your plan does not solve the main problem."

"Ugh."
Saber's right.
We don't even know what that shadow is.
So we shouldn't be trying to find the shadow right now. We should rather be trying to find out what it is, and where it's coming from.

"...I guess the Ryudou Temple then. I noticed that Caster was acting strange.  I think there's something there."

"Yes. That mountain is filled with an ominous presence. The land there is the spiritual focus of this town.
 It is worth investigating, regardless of whether the shadow is there."
"Then it's decided. Let's go."

We walk to the gate.
We can reach the temple in an hour, if we hurry. We don't have any time to lose, but

"Saber?"
Saber is looking at the outbuilding.
She is looking at Sakura's room, where Sakura should now be sleeping.

"...Shirou. I have something to discuss with you. It follows this morning's conversation."
"...? You mean about Sakura?"

"Yes. Sakura's guilty conscience is too strong. She has a tendency of trying to atone for her sins in the present rather than the future."

...She must be talking about the quarrel they had yesterday.
Saber said Sakura was right, so Sakura had no reason to worry about it.
But Sakura said she was still at fault, went and apologized to Saber, and had Saber apologize to her instead.

Sakura and Saber.
Saber must be worried about the difference in their thought process.

"...What do you mean?"
"...Sakura places too much blame upon herself. She punishes herself for her errors instead of correcting them. She brands herself with her dishonor, rather than working to recover her honor. She burdens herself in a good way and a bad way."

...She talks with disgust.
It sounds like she's talking about herself more than about Sakura.

"...It was clear to me last night. She is special when she is with you, but I believe she behaves differently in other circumstances. Sakura is liberated from her guilty conscience only when she is with you."

That is the source of her concern.
Sakura should be able to live with pride without needing to rely on another.

"...I see. Sakura certainly is too shy. I'll be careful."
Now that Saber mentions it, it's not healthy for a girl Sakura's age to always be busy helping around the house.
She says it's fun to be here, but she should at least go outside to hang out once in a while.

"...Thanks for looking out for Sakura, Saber.
 I'm really happy that you're worried about her when she has nothing to do with the Holy Grail War."

"...No. I also have a guilty conscience, so it did not seem like someone else's business."

"Ohhold on, Saber. Let's go together."
We head to the gate together.
We head outside within the silence, trying not to wake Sakura up.
...Matou Zouken is standing there, his figure just like before.
His body, which Archer sliced in two before my eyes, is whole once more.
The old magus that could only wait for death is laughing, as if that event was an illusion.

I don't know how he did it, but if he really did recover from that state, it's more on a level of restoration than recovery.
It's not just healing a wound.
It takes great magic to restore a piece of one's body that has been lost.
Thenisn't this called immortality?

"Well. What do you intend with a single piece of wood, child?"

I stand there while pointing the strengthened stick at Zouken.

I can't charge at Zouken, nor can I retreat to follow Saber.
...If Zouken is immortal, a scrap of wood will never be able to match him

"Will you try to kill me, or will you go after your Servant? Either way, nothing starts until you move."
Something is squirming around the old magus as he speaks.
No, it's not just his surroundings.
The darkness itself is moving, blocking the moonlight.

"Worms."
I can tell, even though I can't see them.
The darkness is probably swarms of worms.
The walls of this temple are covered in something darker than darkness itself.
This space is filled with the sound of creeping worms and the smell of rotten meat.

"Why do you hesitate? Your little alliance cut me in half only yesterday. Did you not cooperate with Tohsaka specifically to kill me?"

...It's obvious that he is enjoying this.
I can't fight off thousands of worms with just this stick.
I'll be swallowed in those worms once Zouken gives the order.

Or maybe...
I might be able to escape if I sprint for the exit.
They are just worms, even if it is a horde of them.
It should take them more than a few seconds to kill a human being.

"All right, I shall wait as long as you want.
 You can believe in Saber's return and wait here, try to kill me with that weapon of yours, or shake off my worms and try to escape outside. You can choose how you want to die."

...Humph.
It seems he has no intention of letting me go.
The worms increase in number as we stand here glaring at one another.
Then

.....No.
I can't move recklessly.
I'm worried about Saber. I want to run to her and see if she's all right.

But that means turning my back to Zouken.
In this situation, doing so will be fatal.
'Please protect yourself there, Shirou.'
That's what Saber said.
Then I have to make my stand, no matter what.

"Oh. I see, I see. You two must place strong trust in each other."
...I'm not going to let his words tempt me.
I tighten my grip on my weapon and concentrate, anticipating his attacks.

"All right. Then let us test our endurance. You can wait and see if you made the right choice."
Murderous intent disappears from Zouken.
The old magus steps back and fades away, as if melting into the darkness of the worms.


His presence is almost gone.
I glare at Zouken, who should still be in front of me.
......
............
..................
........................
.....................And after one minute...

"Huh?"
I hear wind blowing far off, and sudden pain shoots through my left hand.
My left hand is prickling.
My Command Spell is hurting as if it's bleeding.

"Saber...?"
I have a bad feeling.
I have a bad feeling.
I have a bad feeling.
The pain on my left hand.
The sound of wind has stopped.
The old magus is laughing with murderous intent that is almost visible.

"It seems she has been taken care of. You should be able to tell as a Master. That your Servant has been eliminated from this world!"


My brain stops.
My vision freezes.
Whatis this guy saying?

"Why are you shocked? Saber has died. She has been defeated by Assassin, one she took lightly as a weaker opponent. Can you not tell that simple fact?"
"What?"

What the hell is he saying?
My left hand hurts.
My left hand certainly hurts.
But my Command Spell is still there.
It's fading, but it's still there.
ThenSaber should be coming here any second now!

"Come, Saber...!"
I scream as if to erase the pain on my left hand.
I put as much magical energy as I can into my left hand.
I don't know how to use the Command Spell.
But if this can answer the Master's wish, it should bring Saber here right away

"Kuh!"
There's no response.
The Command Spell was about to activate, but suddenly stopped.

There is nothing wrong with it.
If there is a problem, it is on Saber's end

"You are doing a meaningless thing. Even a Command Spell cannot resurrect a lost Servant.
 Well, even a fool like you should understand now. Saber has been killed by my Servant."

"Don't"
"Then let us end things here. There are still uses for the daughter of Tohsaka, but you are of no more use. You can die along with Saber on my holy land."
"Talk shit, dammit!"

I run.
I charge at the enemy in front of me, as if to shake off the ominous thought and the pain on my left hand.
It's obvious that the situation is getting worse by the second.
Then I'll escape this danger while I can still move.
I'll beat that old magus before all those worms can crawl at my body!

My attack doesn't feel effective.
A diagonal slash cuts the old magus from shoulder to hip.  Scraps of flesh scatter across the temple.

"My! I see, I see. You sure are a resolute child!"
The head on the ground laughs.

", ......!"
My weapon crumbles to dust.
Damn.
He sacrificed his body just to rot the stick I strengthened...!

"It's over now. Your youthful ardor has cost you your only weapon. My, young people lack patience these days."
"......!"

I run.
I run, stepping on the worms in my way.
Death follows close on my heels.
I try to escape the waves of worms attacking me.
I ram the black wall with my shoulder...!

"I'm out...!"
Unable to stop my momentum, I fall and roll on the ground.

"Hah, ah...!"
The worms aren't coming after me.
It must be because I ran frantically, as I end up out on the other side of the compound.

"Ouch......"
I must have landed funny, as my whole body is hurt.
"So what? More importantly"

I have to find Saber as fast as I can.
I have a bad feeling.
I have to see Saber's face, to reassure myself that she's all right

"!"
The water surface rustles.
Sensing danger, I jump back.

I get my feet away from the wet mud.
"......!?"
But I'm only able to jump back for a split second.

A sharp pain.
I feel something strange on my heel and look down.

"Wha"
It's red.
My feet are missing from the heels down.

"...It must be that."
I stepped on numerous worms during my escape.
...The strengthened stick rotted just by slashing at Zouken.
Then it's natural for my feet, which stepped on those worms, to follow the same fate.

"Guh...!"
I try to crawl out of the mud using my arms.

"Hah. You were close, child. Your decision was correct, but you lacked the necessary skill."
The worm-user's voice echoes.
The muddy ground.
Since ancient times, spiders have dwelt in the damp places of the earth.

"Well, I have obtained Saber.
 Too bad. The last reason to keep you alive has disappeared."

Worms I've never seen before come scattering down.
Hundreds of poisons that bite on my skin, crawl in my flesh, and melt my bones.
I had to bear the unimaginable pain until my consciousness faded away.
...Should I use the Command Spell...?
I don't think Saber will lose to Assassin.
But this situation is too ominous.
We're fighting this ancient monster. It's too dangerous to have Saber by herself.

"Oh? You've suppressed your poorly made murderous intent. Hm, it seems you have a plan."

He laughs, mocking me.
He is looking down on me, not caring what plan I have.


...Fine, laugh all you want.
If the Command Spell can answer the Master's wish, I am ready to use them all to bring Saber here...!

"Saber"
I concentrate on my left hand while glaring at Zouken.
I have only one command.
To summon Saber to my side!

"Mm......!?"
Even if he realizes what's happening, it's too late.
Heat lights up on my left hand, the concentrated magical energy is released as I wish, and...
...The Command Spell loses its color with a slight pain.

"What?"
I want to think it's because I failed.
I want to think that I used it wrong because I don't know how to use it.

"...Phew. It seems it is over already. You surprised me. You shortened my life by ten years."
He laughs.
...I hear wind in the distance, like a death cry.

I feel a pain on my left hand.
My left hand is prickling.
My Command Spell loses its heat as if it's bleeding.

"Noway."
I have a bad feeling.
I have a bad feeling.
I have a bad feeling.
The pain on my left hand.
The sound of wind has stopped.
The old magus is laughing with murderous intent that is almost visible.

"That is the truth. You should be able to tell as a Master. That your Servant has been eliminated from this world!"


My brain stops.
My vision freezes.
Whatis this guy saying?

"Why are you shocked? Saber has died. She has been defeated by Assassin, one she took lightly as a weaker opponent. Can you not tell that simple fact?"
"What?"

What the hell is he talking about?
My left hand hurts.
My left hand certainly hurts.
But my Command Spell is still there.
It's fading, but it's still there.
ThenSaber should be coming here any second now!

"Don't"
"Then let us end things here. There are still uses for the daughter of Tohsaka, but you are of no more use. You can die along with Saber on my holy land."
"Talk shit, dammit!"

I run.
I charge at the enemy in front of me, as if to shake off the ominous thought and the pain on my left hand.
"Hah!"
I charge at Zouken and swing my weapon with full force.
I swing my weapon down onto his head.
But something obstructs me, and my whole body is flung away.

"Ahguh!"
My back slams against the wall.
I must have been hit in the stomach, as I can't breathe.
My back is numb as if scorched with fire.

I hear worms crawling about by my ear.
The worms by the wall scatter to avoid being crushed by my landing.
...Even the squirming sounds have a mocking tone.

"You've made it, Assassin. Then I shall leave the kid to you as well. This is an easy task compared to Saber, so enjoy it all you want."

Zouken disappears.
And in his place...
A white, skull mask is smiling in the darkness.

...That must be the Servant Assassin.
An assassin with a black outfit and a white mask, appropriate for Matou Zouken.


I'm going to die.
Pain on my left hand.
My numb mind.
My heart accepts the death coming in the next moment and pounds loudly.

And I accept the weapons thrown at my forehead, throat, heart, and stomach.

A flash of silver light repels the weapons.
The four daggers that tried to take my life are blocked with a sword.


There's only one person who would do such a thing.
My left hand still hurts.
The Command Spell is still there.
Then

"Saber...!"
"Fool, did he not kill Saber...!?"

I raise my head.
The one who has come to protect me from the white-masked Servant is...
"What...?"
"Mm...?"
...A Servant dressed in black, just like Assassin.

"Ri... der...?"

There's no doubt about it.
This is Shinji's Servant, Rider.
Why is she here, and why did she save me?

"Are you going to oppose me...!? I don't care, Assassin! Kill her too if she's to get in our way!"
The skull answers Zouken's screamed command.

The long hair flutters.
Rider silently turns to Assassin and...
...She confronts the daggers that are fired like rain.

They move too quickly for mere human eyes to follow.

The masked figure leaps about the temple.
He jumps from the wall to the ceiling, then from the ceiling to the floor, hurling daggers from each position.
Coming from all directions, the daggers can neither be blocked nor avoided.

The relentless onslaught carpets the floor in knives within seconds.
Rider can't manage this.
I know how strong she is from the battle with Saber.
Assassin's attack is something even Saber would have trouble blocking.
It's natural for Rider, who was defeated by Saber in one blow, not to be able to cope with the attack.

The white skull mercilessly fires his weapons.
It...
...Looks like an attack containing irritation.

"Wha"
I realize the abnormality after the superiority is made clear.
...They have not hit her.
Not a single one of the daggers has struck its target.

"You"
A voice comes from overhead.
Apparently out of knives, Assassin looks down at his enemy with undisguised loathing.
There...

Exists one giant serpent.


...I can't believe it.
So many.
Rider evaded the countless daggers with pure speed.

It's different from when she saved me.
Rider avoided all the daggers while crawling on the ground, as if saying there was no need to repel them.

"What are you playing around for, Assassin...!? You don't need to go easy just because she is my grandson's Servant! Finish her...!"
"I cannot do thatshe is different from before."

Assassin stares at Rider while clinging to the ceiling.
Rider is different from before.
Her magical energy and coercion is on a whole new level.
Even if she's still not as strong as Sabershe certainly is stronger than Assassin.

"Kuhwhy?"

Rider doesn't answer.
But her body sinks even lower.

The instant I realize her movement is a gesture to aim at her prey...

...Rider jumps up to the ceiling, and Assassin jumps down to the floor, their blades clashing in midair.

"Kii!"

They land facing away from each other.
Rider is unwounded.
In contrast, Rider's dagger is piercing Assassin's shoulder.

"KuhI can't pull it out!?"
Assassin tries to pull out the dagger in his shoulder.


Then.
With a clinking of chain links...

"WWhaaaaaat!?"
...Rider hurls Assassin through the air...!

"Gah, giii!"
The skull mask lets out a scream of anguish.
Not saying a word, Rider continues to mercilessly swing Assassin about the room.

It's just like a flail.
Unable to do anything, Assassin is smashed against every surface in the room, his limbs bending in all directions.

"Whoa...!"
I duck to avoid Assassin coming around with a whirlwind.

"Gah, kaga, gah!"
This isn't on a level of being strong.
After flailing Assassin to her content, she uses the centrifugal force and lets go.

It's a hammer throw.

Assassin, his bones broken, is thrown at a wall head-first.

"...Oh."
...He flies away.
Like a piece of lifeless trash, the masked Servant bounces through the compound, out the gate, and down the stairs, leaving a trail of blood behind him.

"Oh... wow..."
...How brutal.
I'm sure Servants aren't so weak as to die from that, but he should be unable to continue fighting, at the very least.

"Fool"
Zouken's presence disappears.
The old magus must think he is at a disadvantage, since he flees after snarling a curse at Rider.
The worms that were squirming in the corner disappear, following their master.
...It's morning.
It's past seven o'clock.
Pure white sunlight shines in through the window.

"Mmall right."
I sit up and stretch.
I feel great.
My limbs move fine, and I don't have a headache.
My body is in perfect condition, as if the fever yesterday never happened.

"...Then that must mean it was just heartburn."
I sigh and think it over.
...I need more training if I'm losing consciousness just by recalling the events ten years ago.
My memory is vague, but I do remember Saber helping me walk home and putting me to sleep.

"I see. I have to go thank her."
I get out of my futon and change into my uniform.

I bet she's still sleeping, so I'll thank her during breakfast.
It's seven o'clock already, so I'll go greet Sakura in the living room.

"S-Senpai."
Sakura has her bag.
Breakfast is ready as well.
The table is wiped clean, ready for us to eat at any time.

"Huh? Breakfast's already prepared?"
"Oh, yes. I made some for you and Saber-san, since I had the time."

"...? For me and Saber? What about you?"
"Oh... um, I'm fine. I'm going to school, so please have breakfast with just the two of you."

"......"
 What's wrong, Sakura? It's weird for you not to eat when you've made some for us. ...Did something happen yesterday?"

...It seems like I guessed right.
But nothing happened yesterday.
Sakura went to her room after dinner, and that's all.
I think something happened after that, but I don't remember too well because of my nausea.

"...Oh. I think you and Saber were talking here. I didn't hear it too well, but did something happen then?"

"...I said something awful. I got angry because of the terrible condition you were in."
"You said something awful to Saber...?"

"...Yes. But I was in no position to tell her such a thing. But I treated Saber-san as if she was the only one at fault.
 ...I can't face her today, so..."
That's why she made breakfast and wants to leave before Saber wakes up?

"...I'm sorry, Senpai. I realized my foolishness right away and apologized to her. But Saber-san apologized to me instead. Even though I'm at fault, she said it's because of her carelessness."

She hangs her head.
...I see.
She must feel more self-hatred because Saber apologized to her when she should be the one apologizing.

"...Man, you two are stupid. It's my fault since I'm the one who got hurt. You two shouldn't have fought over such a thing."
"But, Senpai, I..."

"It's fine. Look, she doesn't give in if the other person is at fault. She'll yell back at you if you're being unreasonable. If she's apologizing, it means she sees your point.
 I'm sure Saber won't say it, but she likes you. She cares for anyone that tries hard."

"Yes. But I should reserve myself all the more.
 Since Saber-san didn't scold me, I have to scold myself or I'll get carried away."
Sakura bows to hide her embarrassment.
It seems she's going to school early no matter what.

"...Man. I won't stop you if you say so, but what are you going to do at school so early? Morning practice is suspended right now."

"It's fine. I'm going to clean the dojo. I said such an awful thing to Saber-san, so I'm going to scrub the floor as punishment."
Sakura leaves with a goodbye.

"Cleaning the dojo? But that's pretty hard on you to scrub the floor during wintertime."
...Well, I suppose that's the point.
What did she say to Saber to make her go so far?
"What? A quarrel between Sakura and me?"
"Huh? Didn't you two argue? Sakura was apologizing."

"...Now that you mention it, it may have seemed that way. But Sakura was correct, and she merely pointed out my lack of consideration..."


Wow.
Saber is deep in thought.
Not only that, she's pondering so much that she's eating at incredible speed.

"Oh, I'm sorry if I said something weird. Sakura seemed so worried about it that I ended up worried too.  If it's not a big deal, just forget about it."

"...Geez. You and Sakura are saying the same thing. Do not tell me you two are playing a prank on me."
"Hey, we wouldn't play such an elaborate prank on you! What good would that be for us?"
I don't even want to think of what'd happen if I did play a joke on her and she found out about it.

"That is true. Then you must simply have been concerned for each other."
Nodding to herself, Saber digs into another omelet.
It's good to be able to eat a lot in the morning.

"But what did Sakura say? It takes a lot to get her that depressed. Is it all right if I ask?"
"U-Um. She merely pointed out my inadequacy as a Servant. In short, she told me I could not protect you because I did not have the skill."

"...You're doing more than I can ask.
 What happened last night was my own fault. You can't blame yourself for it."

"That is true, but... Sakura's criticism is correct. The problem is me, because I cannot assent.
 I will continue taking you into battle, no matter what she tells me."

She looks away awkwardly.
"...?"
Something is strange.
Why is Saber so preoccupied with something that they've agreed on?

"...The residents grew suspicious and requested that the area be investigated"

The news is on.
I turned on the TV and found it broadcasting about an incident last night.

"...They found over thirty unconscious people, who were immediately taken to the hospital.
 This is the seventh such incident this month, and the medical examination still believes the cause to be similar to food poisoning"

I finish breakfast and get ready for school.
I'm going to go see Tohsaka.
I have to talk to her about what happened last nightabout Matou Zouken and that black shadow.

"...As the incident has spread to South Miyama 4th Avenue, the police believe the cause may be a spreading chemical spill"

South Miyama 4th Avenue.
That's the direction Tohsaka was staring at yesterday.
...Archer said the shadow is the cause of the incidents.

...Over thirty people are in comas.
I've experienced what they're going through firsthand.
That shadow is sucking magical energy from the people in this town, just like Caster.


No, it's worse than that.
Caster was gentle and considerate compared to that thing.
Caster took care not to harm her victims, so that she could continue to drain them.
It's like collecting blood with a syringe.

...But that thing is different.
That thing was not collecting blood like Caster. That thing was "eating".
The black shadow was mercilessly feeding on magical energy along with people's minds.

"Saber. I want to talk to you before I go to school."
"What is it, Shirou?"

Saber is watching the news as well.
Saber quietly questions me like always, even though she should know what I want to talk about.

"It's about our future plan of action. You saw that thing too, right?"
"Yes. I have never seen its like, not resembling any of the fantasy race."

"...Right. I don't know what that thing is.
 But it's our enemy. It didn't look like a Master or a Servant, but it attacked me and Tohsaka, and now it's sucking magical energy out of the people in town.
 Then"

"...So our current priority is searching for that shadow?
 We are to fight something that is neither a Master nor a Servant?"

Saber's stare is painful.
...Her goal is to obtain the Holy Grail.
But I'm asking her to get involved in something completely unrelated.
It's natural for her to protest.
But still

"Yes. I can't ignore that shadow. I think this is more important than the Holy Grail War."

Saber silently stares at me.
And when I start to think I can't bear it any longer...

"...Geez. I knew this was going to happen. I do not want to concern myself with that shadow, but..."
"Eh, Saber...? Um, is it all right...?"

"My opinion does not matter, because you will try to do something by yourself even if I refuse.
 I will be putting the cart before the horse. I cannot stay in this world if you die.
 I can only obey, even if I am against your proposal."

"Uh, you're right, but..."
"And I do not know how many more times you will be reckless if I leave you by yourself. It was the second time last night, so the third will certainly happen. I will have to apologize to Sakura again if that happens."

"Then..."
"I am very reluctant, but Servants obey their Masters. I will lend you my sword if that is your decision."

"Saber."
"But Shirou, that shadow is no ordinary opponent. It would be easier to fight Berserker than it."

"Ugh... Yeah, I felt that too.
 It's not a matter of it being strong or not. That thing is just ominous. I don't think we can beat it merely by striking it."

"If you understand, then there is nothing else to say.
 ...But Shirou. To oppose that thing is to go down the most difficult path. Please keep that in mind."

"......? Well, of course I'll be careful. But why are you saying such a thing? Do you know what that shadow is, like Archer does?"

"...No.  Like you, I know nothing about it."

Saber looks away.
And Saber says...

"I vaguely feel that it is the ill star itself. It is like an inescapable curse that destroys everything."
...As if to express her ominous premonition.
"Let's start homeroom.
 Go ahead, day duty... Wait, Aikawa-kun's absent, and Aimono-san's absent too? All right, I guess I'll go ahead. Stand up, every one."

...Homeroom starts.
There are more absent people, giving the room a listless feel.
Well, I think the whole school is probably like this.
Fuji-Nee lightly continues homeroom, but I don't see her usual spirit either.

"So, you can't have any club practices after school.
 That's all I have to tell you. Oh, your first period teacher, Kuzuki-Sensei, is absent, so you have self-study. I brought you all a handout, so work on that, everyone."

Everyone unanimously cheers and starts moving their desks.
Fuji-Nee doesn't care if people work on the handout or not, so everyone's free to do anything as long as they don't go out of the classroom. But

"Shirou."
...So why is she beckoning me to come see her in the hallway in such a suspicious manner?

"What, Fuji-Nee? It's class time, you know?"
"Yeah, but I couldn't go see you this morning, right? So I got really worried and was wondering if you're all right."
"...? What is it all of a sudden? What are you uneasy about?"

"Hmm, I don't really know. I just have this hunch.
 Any time I get this hunch, you could get run over by a car or fall off a bridge. So I'm wondering if you're all right."
"Man. That's normal. If you call that dangerous, I've been in danger all my life."

"Yeah, but I'm just worried.
 It feels like there's a train we have to get on together, but you're still at the platform and I'm waving goodbye to you."
"Hmm. That's pretty concrete... So you woke up after that?"

"Oh, you can tell? I woke up late because of that."
"......"

I'm speechless.
So she didn't come to my house because she just woke up late?
...Well, I'll forgive her, since that's what I expect from Fuji-Nee.

"Don't worry, I'm like always. You've got dark circles under your eyes, Fuji-Nee. You need more sleep."

"Huh? ...Well, yeah. It was busy yesterday, and it looks like it'll be busy today as well. I don't think I'll be able to go over to your place, since I'll be working overtime for a while. Much as I hate to say it, you don't have to make meals for me."

"What...?"
"That's all. Go and work on the handout. You're not doing too well in social studies, so you might fail if you don't go study hard."

Fuji-Nee cheerfully waves goodbye and leaves.

"...I don't have to cook for her? Well, that makes it easier, but..."
It's disappointing as well.
I feel empty as if my normal everyday life has disappeared.
"Yeah. I agree with you.
 I can't ignore that shadow either. I don't know the magus behind it, but I can't let him run freely on my land."

"Then can we still keep our peace?"
"Of course. We don't have much of an option until we eliminate the shadow."

Our conversation ends really quickly.
I went to Tohsaka's classroom, class 2-A, during lunchtime to go get her.
I told her I want to do something about that "black shadow", and her answer was simple.

"What do you want to do? Should we patrol together starting tonight or do things separately?"

"Let's see... I agree, we should divide the workload.
 You can keep doing your nightly patrols. Investigate any place that you or Saber think is strange.
 And I'll go after Zouken while you move around in the open."

"...Matou Zouken? Does he have something to do with the shadow?"

"Who knows? It doesn't seem likely, since Zouken was more terrified than any of us, but something's bugging me.
 ...Well, we can't let him be, regardless. He's acting suspicious, controlling Caster's corpse and making a non-magus like Shinji into a Master."

"I see. You're right. Come to think of it, we joined hands against Caster. So we can't ignore that old man."

"Right. Let's fight that shadow after everything else is taken care of. Even if you find it, don't fight and just investigate it. We have to prepare before we go for the kill."

"Okay, but what are you going to do? You say you're going to follow Zouken, but do you know where he is?"

"Huh...? Oh, I don't know where he is, but I'm going to go to the Matou household. My family is connected to them, so I'm more qualified."
Tohsaka states it simply.
But her plan isn't that simple.

"G-Go to the Matou household!? That means you're going into the enemy base!"
"I know. What are you so surprised about? I'm not going there to fight. I'm just going to investigate."

"Whatare you stupid!? What if Zouken ambushes you!?
 I can't let you go alone. I'll go too, so don't be so reckless!"

"Hey, you're the one being rash here.
 I told you, I know the Matou family. I know their magic, and I can tell how strong Zouken is from yesterday's battle. He's no match for me.
 That old magus is using most of his magical energy to maintain his body, so he doesn't have a direct way to attack me."

"It'd actually be convenient if he came at me head-on. And Shinji's harmless because he's not a Master anymore.
 You can leave the stale fight between magi to me. You go ahead and collect information."

"Mm."
I can't talk back if she can declare it like that.
...Archer will be with her, so I shouldn't worry that much.

"...All right. I'll leave Matou Zouken to you. Saber and I will look for the shadow."
"Yes, please do. ...And Emiya-kun. Sakura is at your house, right?"

"...? Yeah, she's staying over. What about it?"
"No, it's nothing. I'm just relieved to hear that.
 It wouldn't be good if she happened to be at the mansion when I go, right?"

"Oh, you're right. ......I'm surprised. You're really thoughtful."
"H-Hey, why are you looking so surprised? What kind of a person did you think I was?"

"Well, um..."
I thought she was like a storm, coming and going in a flash.

"...Humph. I don't care what you think of me.
 Anyway, I'm going to take care of Matou, so you stay quiet in your house until nightfall."

"All right. I'll leave it to you and go train with Saber. There's still some time until the sun sets."
I get up and head to the door.
Lunch break is almost over, so I should go back soon.

"Bye, Tohsaka. Let's meet here again tomorrow."
"Yes. Let's exchange what we've learned.
 Oh, but Emiya-kun."
Tohsaka grins.


...It's bad when she smiles like that.

I get this bad feeling and hurry to the door, but...
"I don't know about training.
 Isn't there something else you could do with your free time?
 Like caring for the girl living under your own roof?"
...I'm within her range.

"W-What are you saying, you idiot...!!
 S-Sakura's nothing like that, and I'm just having her stay over while Shinji's in a bad mood"

"Oh.  I meant you should let Saber get some rest. That's unexpected. Sakura's the first one to come to your mind when I mention the word 'girl'?"
She grins.

"Ah, um, ugh"
I can feel my face burning.
I feel like my brain is boiling.  I half-expect steam to come shooting out of my ears.

"I'm just joking. I'm just getting back at you. Did you like that?"
"......Hey now. I would doubt your sanity if you liked such a thing."

Strength escapes my body.
I feel like a marionette whose strings have been cut.

"Oh, right. That's your weak spot. I guess it was an ill-natured joke."
"Heh, you're the one that's ill-natured. I'm going ahead!"

"Yes, please go right ahead. I'll stay and laugh for a bit longer."
"......! Damn, see you tomorrow, Tohsaka!"

I stalk back into the building, slamming the door behind me.
...Damn.
Tohsaka's starting to have fun by mocking me.

What does she mean by me "liking it"?
First of all...
What have I done to deserve this kind of treatment?
And the girlTohsaka Rin reaches her destination.
The Matou household.
The workshop of the old family of magi who came to this town two hundred years ago.
Even though her family gave them land as a cooperator, the Matou family are outsiders they never concerned themselves with.
The two families formed a non-aggression pact, and bound themselves to not be concerned with each other's affairs.


She walks on, uncaring.
If there was a pact forbidding the two families to associate, it was broken eleven years ago.
It was originally formed by the heads of the two families.
They had abided by it for two hundred years, though its purpose had been forgotten.

Neither Tohsaka nor Matou have obtained the Holy Grail during that time.
Their pact was made to obtain the Holy Grail.
But since their wish never came true, there is no reason to follow such an ancient pact now.

She strides through the front door without ringing the doorbell.
She did not come here as a guest.
She is here as a Master, to eliminate one of her competitors in this game.

"Well, that's true, but..."
Rin searches through the Matou household with a sour expression.
...The Holy Grail War provided her with the reason to come here.
Therefore, she is not bound by the pact between their families.
Even though she persuades herself, she cannot change her personality.

"...I see. This is the first time I've gone against my dad's instruction."
She mutters to herself.
But it's nothing special.
It's not like something important was destroyed by disobeying her father.

If she regrets anything...
"...How stupid of me. I should've came here earlier if I was going to break the pact anyway."
...It's the remorse towards someone who has endured it for over ten years.

"Rin. It's about the layout of the house. There are two blank areas."
"Huh? Where is that? Is it on the first floor?"
"The second. It's a bit small to be a stairway, but it probably goes down to the basement."
"...Okay. By the way, have you noticed it, Archer?"
"Of course. But it shouldn't be harmful. If you choose to ignore it, I will as well. Our target is that monster."
She nods to his words and goes to the second floor.

Even though the red knight is not visible, he is by her side.
She brought him in case of combat, but it seems he takes notice of small details.
After traversing the house once, he has come up with a blueprint and can point out where the empty spaces are.
Rin has come to realize that Archer is skilled in analyzing the design and structure of objects.

"...I've been thinking. That strong point of yours isn't suited for an archer."
"You can whine later. Here, I got it open. It's dark, so watch"
They stop talking.
From the opening in the wall...
Damp air flows out of the pathway to the basement.
The rotten smell is unbearable even for Archer, who has not taken form.

They come down to a damp, stone paving.
Murky greenish darkness engulfs them.
The numerous holes must be to bury dead people.
In these stone chambers, the corpses decompose and fade away, leaving the holes empty to await their next occupant.

It is like the process of burial above ground.
The only difference is the process of decomposition.
It is not the soil that decomposes the corpse here, but the writhing mass of worms.

"This is the training ground of the Matouthe Makiri"
She gets dizzy.
It's not because of disgust or chill.
It is anger that causes her to shudder, repent, and vomit.
This is the training ground.
A place like this is used as a training ground.
This space containing rotten moisture, the smell of corpses, and infinite worms is the "room" given to the successor of the Matou family.

"!"
What can one learn in such a place?
The only thing here is breeding stock.
Worms to breed. Worms to raise. Worms to train.
The people of Matou have trained, urged, and bred their successor with these worms

How different is this world from her own?

The cold-hearted ways, the difficulty of the tasks, and the pain of the engraved Magic Circuit.
She's not comparing the severity as the successor.
If one is to talk about the burdened sufferings and the harshness, hers is incomparable.
She overcame more difficulties and hardships than anyone.
That is why she is a genius magus and an Average One, the user of the five elements, that the Magic Association is accepting as a scholarship student.

If one orders her to command the worms in this room, she will be able to create a superior spell in half a year.
Rin can create a spell that the successor of the Matou family has been unable to create even after ten years.

Butthis method of learning is madness.
If asked whether she could withstand being violated by these worms, she can only hesitate.

The inheritance of the magic here is not a study, but a torture.
A magic that is taught not to the mind, but to the body.
That is how the Makiris pass on their magic, and this is the preference of the old magus, Matou Zouken.
Therefore...
To be chosen as the successor of the Matou family means to be tortured forever

"Rin."
"...I know. Zouken isn't here. He either ran away or has another secret base. ...Either way, there aren't any clues here, so we should get going."
She leaves the stone room, suppressing her urge to scream.

Her footsteps fade.
...After that.
The worms swarm around what she has vomited out.

She returns to the ground floor.
Her business finished, she makes for the door, and
"Shinji. You're there, aren't you? It's no use hiding."
She calls out to the person hiding in the other secret pathway.

"! Tohsaka, you..."
"...Hmph. I was going to ignore you and go home, but I've changed my mind. Let's talk for a bit, Matou-kun."
"!"
Matou Shinji glares at Rin, but follows her request.

...He is obviously afraid of her.
His fear is not because of facing a Master and her Servant, but rather because of the threatening attitude she's taking.

"D-Don't kid me. I have nothing to talk about. First of all, the Tohsaka family shouldn't associate with the Matou family. Why are you here?"
"Oh? We both go to the same school. I don't think it's strange for me to come over."

"Hah, don't make me laugh. You break the lock, search through my house, and then call it 'coming over'? ...Heh, so I guess it's true that you lost your manners after your dad died. What a pack of morons. Since when did the Tohsaka family start acting like burglars?"

"Is that how I looked? ...Hmm, that's not such a bad idea.
 There's nothing here worth stealing, but burglars do more than that, don't they?
 They go into violent rages when they're found.
 Yes, I do want to act like a burglar right now."
She's joking.
But she isn't smiling at all.
Tohsaka Rin is coldly staring at Matou Shinji, who has his back to the wall.

"......! Y-You idiot, you're wrong! I have nothing to do with Zouken! I didn't know what that old bastard was doing until now...!"
"Yeah? So why did you become a Master?"
"...! That's because"

A gritting sound.
Even though he is cornered by Tohsaka, he swallows his words.
He was willing to tell her anything she wanted to know about the old man.
This girl is dangerous right now. There's no telling what she will do if he keeps quiet.
In the worst case...
She might simply kill him out of rage.

"Because?"
"Because..."
But he can't say it.
Telling her why he became a Master is like asking for death.

Even if...

"Then I'll say it for you. You just wanted to act like a magus. You're a failure and can't be a magus, so you wanted the Holy Grail to make you one.
 You have no other goal. You're a coward that wanted proof to hide your powerlessness."

...It's something trivial for others.

"......! Tohsaka, you...!"
"Am I wrong? You didn't have a Magic Circuit even though you were born to the Matou family. But that's not your fault. The Matou blood was fading away anyway. The duty of the Matou family as the seeker was fading away from the time you people came here.
 But you persisted.
 You thought it was special to be special, and you demanded something you didn't need. You can't be a magus even if you obtained a Magic Circuit like that, but you clung to the special right that should've been given to you."

"D-Don't talk like you know everything...! Don't talk bullshit! I can't be a magus...!? How do you know that!?"
"I can tell. I can say with certainty that you will never be a magus, even if you obtain the Holy Grail.
 You just don't have the talent. That's the difference between you and Emiya-kun."

"What...?"
His jaw drops.
That name is unexpected for Matou Shinji.
It's fine if Tohsaka Rin opposes him as a Master. He expected that.

But it cannot be possible for Emiya Shirou's name to come from her lips.
He is just an amateur.
He isn't from a family of magi, nor is he suited to be a Master.
It's too much for him to have Saber, so why is his name coming out of Tohsaka Rin's mouth!?

"HaHah. What? Stop that, Tohsaka. Why are you talking about Emiya!?"
"Because he's stronger than you. And he has the right qualities to be a magus. Emiya Shirou has something Matou Shinji does not.
 ...Yes, he doesn't have the talent, just like you. But he has the quality to be a magus. He is the best at it, and it's something he won't lose in."

"He's the best!? Him!? Hah, don't make me laugh, Tohsaka...!
 There's nothing he has that I don't have! He's the one who's got nothing! He's just a lucky bastard that made a contract with Saber...!"

Shinji's hatred for Shirou must have blown his fears away, as he now faces Rin straight on.
The girl sighs and shrugs her shoulders.

"......I see. I guess you really are beyond help if you don't understand after all this. I thought I'd hold you responsible, but you're not even worth it. I'll let you go, so go run to the church before Emiya-kun beats you."

She turns her back on him.
Telling him she has no business here.
She heads for the door, not even bothering to treat Shinji as an enemy.

"II'm inferior to Emiya...?"
His voice burns with hatred.
But he can do nothing but watch her go.
He'll surely be killed if he attacks her here.
Even Matou Shinji can see the difference in their powers.

"Tohsakayou, you......!"
A voice filled with deep resentment.
"Geez, I guess it can't be helped."
She stops, and says goodbye to the boy that used to be the successor.

"Fine, this is the end, so I'll tell you.
 Those who aim farther for others' sake. Those who think of others before themselves. ...And those who hate themselves more than anyone.
 These are the qualities of a magus. There is a place you can't reach, no matter how much talent you have.
 ...Humph. I never thought anyone would meet this condition. This is a contradiction you can only have if you're born broken."

"Shinji. You're a good example of someone who nurtures a needless inferiority complex by despising others. You love yourself so much that you believe everyone else is below you, even when they are superior in every way.
 ...You're empty inside. The only one who thinks you're full is you, and you're just like a balloon. Your destination changes depending on the wind."
"Uhguh."

"Do you understand? One such as you is unfit to be a magus.   A Servant would never obey such a person.
 This world is unrelated to you. No matter how much you consider yourself to be a Master, you can never be a Master."

The sound of retreating footsteps.
Tohsaka Rin leaves Matou Shinji alone in the dark room.

"Ha. Haha, hahaha."
He drops down the wall.
Matou Shinji crumples down like a puppet with its strings cut and keeps laughing.

"I see. So that's how it is?"
His tongue licks over dry lips.
A dull sound.
The boy smacks his head hard against the wall behind him, as if trying to break his skull.
"In short...
 He just has to disappear, right, Tohsaka?"
His laughter continues.
"All right, Sakura. Rock, paper..."
"Scissors!"

I stick out a clenched fist.
Sakura extends an open palm.
I have rock, and Sakura has paper.

"Ugh."
"All right, I won!"
I look at my fist.
...I did it again. Why do I always use rock as my first move?

"Then I'll be cooking dinner. Please relax and watch TV or something, Senpai."
Sakura skips off to the kitchen.  She must be happy that she gets to make dinner all by herself.

"...Man, I guess it can't be helped. I promised whoever wins gets to cook dinner."
I take off my apron and sit down.
I don't know about other people, but cooking dinner seems like a favorite pastime for us.

...It's not really true for me, but Sakura always wants to cook by herself.
That's good in a way, but as her Senpai, I can't let her do all the work.
So when we're both bored, like today, we fight over who gets to cook.

"...I have nothing to do, so I'll just drink tea."
I brew some tea and sit at the table.
Saber is sleeping in my room, and Fuji-Nee won't be coming since she's working overtime.
Sakura and I are the only ones here.


...Am I watching her because I have nothing to do?
Sakura is moving briskly about the kitchen, and she looks like she's having fun.

Her familiar hair and her crimson ribbon.
She handles the plates. She holds the heavy kitchen knife and places the cabbage on the cutting board.

"Hm!"
She cuts it with a yell.
Sakura tenses up every times she starts to cut something, but she keeps cooking like she's used to it after that.


I watch it absent-mindedly.
The evening living room.
A daily life here with Sakura, where time passes slowly.

I suddenly realize how hard this life is to obtain.
...It must be because I'll be going to battle at night.
I finally realize how important this time is for me.

"...Yeah. I have to protect Sakura."
I don't know what Matou Zouken is planning, but I won't let him touch her.
I've come in contact with Sakura too many times the past few days, causing me to be bewildered about her change.

...I thought I was confused by her femininity.
But that's wrong.
If I'm confused, it started long before that.

I hear her humming in the kitchen.

...These simple, trivial things are important to me.
I pour myself a third cup of tea and watch the red-tinted scenery.
Maybe there's some alcohol in the tea, because the passing time feels slow and tender.
We climb over the "no trespassing" fence into the temple.
The Ryudou Temple is now treated as important material evidence in the coma incident, and no one is allowed to enter.

"......"
The night air is not any different.
It's warm, and it smells like ripe fruit.

"...Let's go in, Saber."
"Yes. ...Please be careful, Shirou."
"I know. Tell me right away if you feel anything dangerous."

...We go through the compound and climb up to the entryway.
The wooden hallway is dark, and the floor creaks with each step.

"...Nothing seems strange. How about you, Saber?"
"...It is the same for me. But I am sure this area is abnormal. We are surrounded by a different common sense ever since we came on this mountain.
 ...It is abnormal because this mountain is filled with magical energy and we do not find it abnormal."

"...You're right. Okay, let's investigate a bit more. This temple has a lake behind it. There are more buildings over there."

...It is said that a dragon lives in that lake.
There may be a clue at the place people consider holy.

We go out into the hallway and head behind the temple.
At that instant...
"Shirou!"

"Saber...!?"
I'm shoved back into the temple by Saber.
I realize Saber has pushed me, try to go back out into the hallway, and...

The exit is shut firmly by Saber.

"Saber!? Hey, what are you doing, you idiot...!"
I bang on the door.
I don't know what kind of magic it is, but the door is as hard as steel.

"Hey, what are you doing!? Open the door, Saber...!"
The door refuses to budge, even when I throw my weight against it.

And from the other side of the steel-like door...
"Please protect yourself there, Shirou...! This opponent will only target you...!"

"What!? Who's the enemy!? Is it that shadow!?"
"No! But this Servant is a natural enemy of Masters! I am sorry, but I cannot protect you if you are at the battleground.
 I have to fight Assassin one-on-one, or he will kill you first...!"

"Assassin...!?"
I didn't even sense him.
Even though the air is strange here, a Servant's presence is a different matter.
The magical energy should be apparent if a Servant takes form near us.
Even if he hid his presence, I should be able to tell, let alone Saber!

"I will finish the battle in one blow. Please do not move until then!"
Saber's presence fades.
Her footsteps are loud. She must have repelled Assassin's attacks as she charged within range.

"Damn"
I look around.
I pick up a stick that's about the size of a wooden sword and "strengthen" it immediately.

"Hurry..."
I have to make this into a sword and break open this door.
An ominous feeling, a mysterious uneasiness, fills my mind.
This place.
It feels like a fatal mistake to leave Saber by herself on this mountain, so I have to hurry and

"!?"
The lights go out.
No, there was no light to begin with.
The moonlight has been blocked off by clouds.

"!"
...I smell something.
A smell of rotten meat and sounds of bugs flying around.

"Matou Zouken."
I glare into the darkness.
"Hah. Talk about walking into a trap, young lad."
A snicker.
It's that old magus. He's hiding somewhere.

"......Saber."
I ready the strengthened weapon.
I have no fear, even with a centuries-old monster in front of me.
The only thoughts in my mind are of concern for Saber.
"Guh!"
I'm brought back to my senses by the pain from my stomach, where Assassin hit me.
...Only Rider and I are in the temple now.
I take a deep breath and try to calm down.
Then.
I realize that the only pain I feel is in my stomach and back.

"Sa"
Instinctively, I know what that means.

"Ber"
I endure the dizziness as I head out to the hallway.

"Please wait. It's dangerous to go alone."
"......You..."
There's no enmity coming from Rider.
It seems she actually came to help me.

"...Why?"
I don't care why she saved me.

More importantly

"...You're Shinji's Servant. So why did you save me?"
I want to go there quickly.
So why am I taking my time?

"My orders are not to let you die. I only obeyed my master."

...I see.
That's fine. I don't believe her, but it's good that I got an answer.
More importantlyI have to hurry and go there.

"......"

I understand right away that this is the place.

The corridor is dead silent.
The whole place is destroyed as if a storm passed by.
In it... is a small red stain on the only part of the ground that hasn't been destroyed.

I can't tell whose blood this is.
Butmy legs lose strength the instant I see it, and I crumple to my knees.


I reach out and touch it.
The blood is dry, and it doesn't stick to my fingers.
The only thing the stain tells me is that she disappeared here.

'My role is to protect you, Shirou.'


How many times did I hear that line?
Those words were a comfort and a source of worry.
...She only cared about me.
And she never said anything about protecting herself.


I scratch at the mark.
Saber fought here and fell here.
That's what happens in battle.
I knew before I made a contract with her that this would be a battle to the death.
I accepted the fact and took her hand, and she merely answered me

"Saber"
The girl who protected me, even though she was smaller than me.
When I told her I wanted to put priority on the black shadow over the Holy Grail, she simply nodded, ignoring the premonitions of her end.

...And this is the result.
I lost her, lost my rights as a Master, and am back to being just an amateur.
I am now alone, with no means of fighting
I have to carry through with what I have to do.

"Then I have to go."
I slowly rub the bloodstain one last time.
That's it.
I don't bow or thank her, and let my fingers go.

Pain assails my left hand, and it disappears.
The moment I acknowledge her death and say goodbye...
The Command Spell on my left hand disappears without trace.

...One does not lose the Command Spell just because one has lost his Servant.
It only disappears when the magus loses his right to be a Master.

"I see. So I..."
I don't know what happened here tonight.
There is only one certainty.
I lost Saber and lost my rights as a Master.

...I leave the Ryudou Temple.
My stomach and back seem to be wounded badly, but I'm not worried about the pain right now.

"I shall see you home. It is dangerous to walk alone at night, even with the enemy gone."
"...What?"
I stop unintentionally.
All of Rider's words tonight are unexpected.

"I don't get it. Is that also an order from your Master?"
"No, I have received no such command. This is my personal choice. It is a whim of mine, nothing more."

"...I see. I'll believe you in that case, but you don't have to walk me home. We're enemies, so I can't get further in debt to you."
"Enemiesso you still have the will to fight us? Even though you are not a magus and have lost your Servant?"


I don't answer her.
First of all, I never said I'm out of this war.

"OkayI understand. Then please be careful on your way home."
Her long hair flutters.
Rider heads to the mountain gate ahead of me.
Is it because she looks so defenseless?

"...Thanks."
I mutter something I forgot to tell her earlier.

"What?"
She turns around, looking surprised.
"Ugh..."
I'm embarrassed to see a reaction like that, but I have to properly thank her.

"What did you just say?"
...And she's asking me seriously, too.
It's awkward to stare at her straight on, so I avert my gaze.

"I-I said thank you. I would've died if you hadn't saved me.
 ...As you can see, I can't give anything in return right now. So I have to at least thank you."

"Please do not mind. I only obeyed my orders.
 I will kill you immediately if my master's order changes."
With those cold, emotionless words, Rider disappears through the mountain gate.

"I thought so. That's why I told her I wouldn't take any favors."

I start walking after Rider disappears.
I can think later as to why Rider saved me.
...It takes an hour to get home.
I have to shake off the lingering memory of her in that short time.
I return to my house.
It's already past one o'clock.

"Guh."
I put my hand over my mouth as I cough up blood.
My stomach still hurts from Assassin's attack. And my back still burns from hitting the wall.
I don't know how badly wounded my stomach is, but I bet my back is just scratched.
The wounds that healed so quickly before aren't healing at all.

"I see. I'm back to my old self again."
When I had my contract with Saber, wounds healed themselves.

But that's lost.
Even a slight wound could prove fatal now.

"Senpai."
Then.
When I go into the front hallway, I find Sakura waiting for me.

"......Sakura? What are you doing up so late? Did I wake you up?"

"No, I just couldn't sleep. I noticed your shoes weren't here, so I was wondering where you went."
"Oh, I was just taking a walk."

...Come to think of it, the light was on when I came home.
Then was Sakura waiting here the whole time?

"Sakura. Were you waiting at the door all this time?"
"Huh? N-No, that's not true.
 I got up to go to the bathroom, and I just happened to be by the door when you came."

"......"
She was waiting here.
It's been over three hours since Saber and I left.
Maybe Sakura noticed right away and was waiting here all this time.

"A-Anyway, do you want some tea!?
 It's a bit late, but you'll get your spirit back if you drink warm tea and relax!"


I'm surprised.
Sakura is really pushy right now.
...I must really look terrible if she's forcing herself to act this way.

"Yeah, please. I'm home. I'm sorry I went out without telling you."
I take off my shoes and go into the hallway.
I hold my aching stomach and head to the living room.

With me in front of her...
"...Yes. Welcome home, Senpai."
Sakura looks relieved.

"Ouch!"

I wince with pain, but lie on the cushion and bear it.
The disinfectant keeps stinging my back.
The sizzling sound makes it feel like I'm getting my back scorched.

"That hurts, Sakura. I think that's enough disinfectant. Just wipe the wound and put gauze on it."

"No! We have to disinfect it properly because your back is all red! And it's natural that it hurts. You came home with such a big wound, so please bear it."

"Ouch!"
...Is it because of the archery club or Fuji-Nee that she's merciless toward injured people?

"Does it hurt anywhere else, Senpai?"
"Mm...? No, I only hurt my stomach and back. Everything else is fine."

"I see. Then all that's left is to put some gauze on and tape it up."
Sakura handles the first-aid kit with practiced ease.
She looks so intent on it that I don't want to interrupt.

"Phew."
Well.
Let's explain why this is happening. It's because I threw up the tea I drank because it stung my stomach.
I didn't want Sakura to find out, but that gave it away.

I had no choice but to tell her how badly I was hurt, and now she's treating me.
Well, she wasn't that much of a devil to begin with.

"Ehyou hurt your stomach...!?"
When I showed her my stomach...
...She was blushing so badly that she couldn't treat me.

"Are you okay with this, Sakura? I can treat myself, so you don't have to push yourself. Besides, my back is even worse."
"I-It's all right! I'll do it! Please let me do it!"
She was so flustered that I half-expected her to faint when she saw the wound on my back.

"S-S-Senpai, please take off your shirt."
I didn't want to stop Sakura, since I couldn't treat my own back.
I did as I was told and let her treat me.

Still, it was so bad that she couldn't do anything for a while.
She stared at it for a few minutes and started treating me after a gulp.


That was twenty minutes ago.
It's past two o'clock now.
Sakura's careful treatment is about to end.

"Okay, it's all done now. Here's a new shirt, so please put this on."
"Huh...? It's done already? Thanks, Sakura."

"You're welcome. Thanks for your patience."
I put on the new shirt and take a deep breath.
...There's nothing to be done about my stomach, but my back feels much better.
I'll sleep face-down tonight, and hopefully it'll be better tomorrow.

"Well. Let's get some sleep. I'm sorry I kept you up so late, Sakura."
"Ehno, that's fine, but..."
Sakura hangs her head.
It seems like she wants to say something, but can't.

"Sakura? Did something happen while I was gone?"
"......No, um... Senpai, did Saber-san go home?"


I get dizzy for a second.
'Did Saber-san go home?'

When I hear the words from someone else, the reality of it finally sinks in.

"Yeah. I know it was sudden, but she went home. She's not coming back."

I endure my dizziness and answer calmly.
...It's not like it's a stupid question.
Of course she would think something happened if Saber, who was here four hours ago, is gone.
But I have to put on a strong face and act like nothing's wrong.

"Saber was talking about you before she went away. She said you should take it easy because you're the type that thinks too hard."

"...I see. I wish I could've told her goodbye, since we just made up."
I can't even nod to that.
Saber disappeared before I could even say goodbye.

...The fact makes my heart feel so heavy that I want to vomit.
A collaborator for only six days.
My partner for only six days.
How can I repay herthe one who was my sword for only six days?

"But I'm glad. Ever since she came, you've been getting injured all the time. Now everything's back to normal."
"What?"

"Isn't that right? I won't ask you what you were doing, but you were going out to help Saber-san, right?
 Now that she's gone, you're not going to be exposed to danger anymore."

"You're wrong. I'm going to keep going out at night, even though Saber's gone. ...Um, it's not that I was helping Saber.  Saber was helping me."

I stand up.
My tension is gone now that the treatment is over.
I'm getting really sleepy.

"EhSenpai?"
"Good night, Sakura.
 And while we're on the topic... I'll be leaving my house a lot more often starting tomorrow, but you can keep using this place like you've been.
 I'll come home late, like tonight, but I don't want you to worry and go to sleep. Please don't wait by the door for me like you did tonight."

"............Okay. Good night, Senpai."

I rest my body.
...I didn't feel it until now, but I'm dead tired.
Drowsiness overtakes me the moment I lay down.


But before I do so, I glare into the darkness to prepare myself.
What Saber lost against, and what I should be fighting...
I have to accept them here and now.


...It hurts just to think about it.
My body is trembling, and my mind is about to lose against anger or fear.

"What I have to fight against..."
It's that shadow.
That "thing" that attacks people without discrimination.
The black shadow that even Saber and Archer fear.

...I know with certainty, even though I didn't see it.
That is what defeated Saber.
Assassin cannot defeat Saber.
So if there is something at the temple that can defeat her, it's that shadow.


I have to beat the thing that beat Saber.
On top of that, I'll have to deal with Matou Zouken and Assassin.
Zouken said there's no more use for me now that I'm no longer a Master.
But so long as I stay in the Holy Grail War and search for the shadow, Zouken will continue to haunt me.


A shiver runs through my body.
Saber's not with me anymore.
I have no miracle that heals my wounds, and the only weapon I have is magic as a half-ass magus.
I know this is a reckless, suicidal choice.

"But I decided to fight. I said I'll become a superhero."
I lost Saber because of that.
I've walked in Kiritsugu's footsteps ever since the fire because of that.

My only option is to stop the war so such a disaster will not occur again.
...So this will be the only night that I'll tremble in fear.
When my wound heals and morning comes...
I have to act strong so the girl who disappeared can be proud of me.
The girl returns to her room.
She walks with heavy steps to her bed and sits on it.

"......Senpai. He's so badly injured, and still..."
She doesn't know what happened.
The boy looked as lifeless as a starving man, and his body was covered with wounds.
The golden-haired girl who first appeared here several days ago has not returned.
From this, she can tell something has happened that can never be undone.
The boy is hiding something, and the golden-haired girl will not return as a result.

"......"
But such things don't matter.
For her, such things are trivial.
She doesn't know what happened, but it's fine as long as the boy is safe.
For her, having Emiya Shirou come home is an unparalleled joy.

"......Wait... is it cold today...?"
She shivers and brings her hand up to her forehead.
...It's hot.
Her body is burning up, and she has to fight to remain conscious.
It must be a light cold.
She rarely gets sick, but after waiting in the hallway for nearly three hours, it's hardly a surprise.

".........Mm..."
With sluggish movements, she reaches over and turns off the light.
She lets herself fall to the bed, lacking even the energy to change clothes.

"...It's fine. This is nothing compared to what Senpai is going through"
The girl recalls what she saw a few minutes ago.
...The wounds on his back, almost as if the flesh had been grated.
...The blackening bruise on his stomach.
...His eyes, still strong and clear in spite of his condition.

"......Ah..... Mm, fu"
Her temperature rises as she remembers.
The girl pretends not to notice that it stems from the hatred she feels.

"...Who could do such a thing?"
...Yes.
She doesn't know who did it, but she can't forgive this person.
It's not temporary dislike or annoyance.
He has been wounded all this time, but he has stayed beautiful.
She cannot forgive anyone that hurts someone important to her.

"Hm... but... Senpai's back was amazing..."
She reaches out her hand in a daze.
...It's been a while since she last saw his naked skin so close.
When they first met, he was small as a boy and was about as tall as her.
But in the two years since then, he has grown into a man.

"............Hm"
Something stirs beneath the sheets.
Trapped between her body and the bed, her hand slowly creeps down between her legs.

It's different from when he collapsed from a cold.
Back then, it was a cold and nothing more.
Tonight, it was the body of a wounded man.

"Senpai."
Thinking about it causes her to space out.
He must train without a day's rest.  His body is sturdily built, without even an ounce of useless muscle.
His graceful build is like that of an antelope. It has the beauty of having inner strength, one that allows it to jump up precipices, that is not apparent.

"Yeah... His chest was broadhe was a real man."
Her outstretched fingers run across the chest that is not here.
She unconsciously runs her fingers across his body.
They run from his chest down to his stomach.
Crawling across the bedsheets, her fingers travel below her belly button and...
"Oh."
Her face turns bright red.

"S-S-S-S-Stupid me...!
 I-I'm sorry, Senpai...!"
She quickly pulls her hand back.
She even turns her ears red and curls up on the bed.
It shouldn't be this embarrassing, but her memory is too vivid.
The feel of his skin beneath her fingertips only made her imagination more concrete.

"Huh?"
But...
Is that what caused her to heat up?
"Ahmm, fuh......"
Her heart starts to beat faster.

"Mm...... Ah, ah"
It's too late to stop.
...Her body is hot.
Her mind is in a daze, and she can only think of one thing.
Her limbs are heavy, and it feels as if she has turned into a puppet.

"Hah... Hm, ah... Ah, mm... Fuh"
...Her breaths are unbelievably hot.
Is it because the heat is escaping from her body?
The heat invades her brain and melts her memory, intelligence, reason, and morals, making her think of only one thing.
"Ah, hah... Senpai... Hm..."
The heat takes over her body, and the limbs are out of her control.
But dirty desire creeps up from within her.

"Ahhaa, ah, hm!"
She doesn't stop.
She moves her fingers, which were just tracing Shirou's body, down between her legs.

"...Senpai... Senpai, Senpai, Senpai...!"
...Her fingers start to move wildly as if to match her breathing.
The wet sound slowly gets louder into something indecent.

"Ahhm... NoI... shouldn't... be doing... this"
The feeling of guilt excites her even more.
His wounded body. Thinking about the blood on his back makes her dizzy.
The girl who won't be coming back. The realization that, once again, he is all hers. Many lies.
The dark emotions, unthinkable for her usual self, draw her down into a darker passion.

"Hah, haa, ha, mm...! Sen... pai... Ah, I, Iah... Hm... no...!"
But those are trivial matters.
What she's truly glad about is that the boy has come back to her.

 "Nhaa...! Ha, haa, ah, Senpai's, fingersmoreno, having him back... is enough...!"
...But it's not enough.
Tonight made that clear.
He cares for her, but he tries to protect her by keeping her away.

"Ah, nha, hah, ah...! No, Senpai, II want, you to be, next to me...!"
She knows it's a greedy wish.
Her passion gets worse because it is a wish she should never speak of, a wish that will never come true.

"Mmuha, ah, hm...! I'm sorryI'm sorry, Senpai, I'm... sorry...!"
A heated masturbation.
The repeated repentance cools off the

 girl's temporary madness.

"...Mm... Ah...... Haa... ah"
She stares at the ceiling absent-mindedly.
The overwhelming self-hatred after the climax is familiar to her.
But a heavier agony assails her tonight.

...The wounded body.
He said he intends to continue fighting, even after receiving such wounds.

"......What should I do? Senpai's going to get hurt even more like this..."
She thinks as her body sweats.
It's a worry without an answer, a problem the girl cannot solve.
She cannot come up with a way to stop him, even if she thinks all night.
But...

"I see. I just have to keep him from going outside."
She reaches a simple answer with a calm voice.
Delighted by her sudden insight, she smiles and...
"Right. You won't get in any more danger if you're hurt so badly that you can't walk"
Whispers to herself with a sigh of relief.
It is a room that smells of stone.
The light is not artificial but natural.
The lamp's flame shines on the man's back and illuminates the parchment in his hand.

"Is that a report for the Association? You certainly are a busy man, Kotomine."
The voice comes from behind him without revealing its source.
The man on the chair, Kotomine Kirei, moves on to his next task without the slightest reaction.

"Oh, so this is about that usurper.
 Hm, 57 victims with five dead. Is this a lot from the supervisor's perspective, Kotomine?"
"I can't say much as of this moment. This is the first instance of large-scale unconsciousness, but there's no problem if it stays this way. Either association is aware of the necessary clean-up measures.
 But"
"If it continues at this pace, huh? ...Heh, I do not know who is doing this, but they're being quite brazen.
 ...Have you realized, Kotomine? If nothing is done, this town will become barren of life."

Kotomine does not answer.
He knows what the man wants to say.

The strange shadow that appeared in this town.
It's only sucking up life force right now, but the amount is increasing by day.
The abnormality that first surfaced two days ago will exceed the regulated allowances in a few days.
For the moment, it only causes dyspnea, but it should soon be enough to kill even a healthy adult male in one night.

"But that is needless worry. It should not be an amateur, so it should know its limits."
"Is that so? That worm-user does not seem like it, but such a person will become a curse if you do not take care of it quickly. It is not my style to watch people in this town die."

This statement takes Kotomine by surprise.
This man, who does not care about anyone else, is concerned for the people.

"I'm surprised. What is going on, Gilgamesh?"
"It should not be surprising. I do not like it when people are killed by someone besides me. People will lose their way with boring crime and punishment. Such pain is not entertaining at all."

"...I see. Then you are indeed a heroic spirit.
 You use death to save people from the agony of life. Then your wish is death?"
"Of course. This age is filled with meaningless, worthless people.  Exterminating them will be doing them a service."

His scorning voice is filled with absolute dominance and dignity.
The priest does not stop his work as he listens.

"I see.
 You can use the Holy Grail, if that is what you wish. It will be yours unless someone who can defeat you appears."
"Hm? You do not have a wish, Kotomine?"
"I don't have a clear wish. The only thing I have is the desire for clear pleasure."
"HaHahaha, I see, so you only have pleasure!"

The man starts laughing at the simple answer.
It's as if he's delighted and proud of his partner.

"All right. I shall kill because they are disgusting, and you shall kill because it is fun. Our motives are different, but we seek the same thing from the Holy Grail. That must be why you have kept me!"

The priest does not answer.
He merely continues his work.

"HahI do not care even if you do nothing. I shall do as I please."
The man's presence disappears.
The priest glances at the exit of the silent stone room.

"He seems insane, but he is sane at the core. It seems the mud was unable to pollute his soul."
King of heroes, Gilgamesh.
The golden Servant is the most powerful being at this point in time.
The fact is accepted as truth by all.  Even Kotomine, the game master himself, does not doubt it.
But

"There are worthless things, but there are no meaningless things.
 ...Beware, king of heroes. If there is something that will bring you defeat, it will be just that."
His monologue does not reach anyone.
Lit by the dim light, the priest resembles a prophet seeing into the future.
Continuation: Not enough love!

Ugh, the one who reformed and graduated from this dojo has been reborn as a devil child. ...Will she really be able to become a heroine?

...Well, I guess it's impossible.
Impossible. It's impossible no matter what!

I bet she's trembling outside right now, wanting to come back, but can't because of all the big talk she gave me!

Well, it's cold outside, so I bet she'll come back with a souvenir around the next dojo.

So, this bad end is also because of lack of love.

It's obvious whose love you're lacking this time, right? Try getting a bit closer with Ilya-chan so that she won't go full out on you.

The important points are whether you meet Ilya-chan on the 7th day and how you apologize to her.

You have to restart from day 5 if you can't meet her on day 7.
You have to consult Tohsaka-san if you see her at school.

That's the end of this Tiger Dojo.
Please continue enjoying Sakura-chan's route, where the atmosphere completely changes with the appearance of many new characters.
Welcome!
This is the familiar Tiger Dojo, the place that saves Shirou, who died from a simple bad choice!

This dead end is because you made the wrong decision!
I won't explain in detail, so go back to the previous choice and choose another

There, trespasser!

Ouch!

How ridiculous of you to try to take over!
What are you doing here while I was gone, pupil number one!?

Ouu... I showed up naturally, but you easily saw through it.

How dare you say that, buruma.

So, what's gotten into you?
I thought you wouldn't be coming to the dojo because you'd be busy in the main storyline.

Eh...ahaha, well, um, the power balance was not what I expected... And, see, I came back, thinking that you might be lonely by yourself.

..................And?

Ah, um... uhh...

Uwaaa, I'm selling my pride!
Please, master, I want to be your pupil again!

Okay, I refuse with all my might! Live as a homeless bum, you buruma-girl!

All right! That's why I hate you!
Then I'll do it by force! You just watch! I'm going to take over this place next time!

Hahaha, I'll take that challenge, you devil-child!
I shall wait and see what you can manage without any magic, gahahahaha!

It's lunchtime.
In accordance with our agreement, I meet up with Tohsaka on the rooftop and tell her what happened last night.
And the result is...

"Then what!?
 Matou Zouken is Assassin's Master, and he tried to kill you and not Saber!?"
...Tohsaka getting really angry.

"T-That's right. What's with you all of a sudden?"
"It's not sudden!
 From what I heard, Zouken tried to kill you after Saber was defeated. That's strange. The process is wrong no matter how you look at it!"

Tohsaka leans forward and glares at me.
I back up just a few centimeters because of her attitude, but we're sitting in our spot behind the water tower.

"Hey. Are you listening to me, Emiya-kun? Didn't you think something was strange about what you told me?"
Tohsaka Rin glares at me in dissatisfaction.

"Ugh."
...As if her attitude wasn't bad enough, now she's getting right in my face.
This space is small, so there's no room for me to back up.
I'm like a mouse in a trap. There's nowhere for me to run.

"Umm...... What was strange?"
"It's the priorities. Zouken didn't try to kill you, even though you two were alone.
 It was fortunate that Assassin was able to beat Saber, but there was also a chance of Assassin's defeat. Zouken should've tried to kill you, Saber's Master, as quickly as possible."

"...Well, that's true.
 But maybe Zouken was confident that Assassin could beat Saber."

"No way. Even you could tell that Assassin was weaker, right? Then Zouken definitely wouldn't gamble like that.
 ...I bet he had a reason not to kill you.
 Well, I can think of two reasons."

"Two...? So that's..."
"Was he on guard against my counterattack?"

"I don't think so. From what you've said, I don't think your counterattack would've been effective. And if I were Zouken, I wouldn't leave a trapped enemy enough room to counterattack.
 Setting up a trap shows that you're determined to kill your opponent.
 If you're worried that your target will attack you once he's fallen into the trap, your trap is a failure."

"I see. An opinion expected from a perfectionist, Tohsaka."
"That was just a generalization. You don't go into the cage yourself if you want to capture your opponent alive, right?"
"...Maybe he didn't want to kill me right then?"

"...Well, I guess that's the most likely motive.
 I have to assume that Zouken didn't want Saber to disappear. The only negative effect of your death would be Saber's disappearance."
"Yeah. That's all I'm good for."

"Hey, why are you sulking? I-I'm just talking about Zouken, so don't take it too seriously."
"...? I'm not sulking. It's true.  Why are you getting mad about this?"

"...! I-I'm not mad.
 You're just misunderstanding me."
"...I guess he was playing around. Maybe he thought he could kill me any time."

"...Yeah. I'm sure there's some other reason, but maybe he could afford to keep you alive as long as he wanted.
 Maybe we could take advantage of that opening..."
"Anyway. Zouken had something he wanted out of Saber.
 He probably wanted you to stay alive as a Master. But with that aside, he had a reason to kill you.
 ...I'll ask again. You're sure that he said you're useless, right?"


...I recall what happened last night.

"There are still uses for the daughter of Tohsaka.
 But you are of no more use"

"...Yeah. And he also said you're still useful."
"I see. ...I don't know why you're useless now, but that must be why he's running away from me.
 One of us has to die if we meet. But Zouken needs both of us to stay alive for some reason, so he's hiding from me"

Tohsaka ponders.
"............"

Well.
I've told her what I need to tell her.
If there's anything else I should say, it's
...No, I have nothing to say to her.
This is my problem.
I chose to keep fighting.

Matou Zouken and Assassin.
The black shadow wandering around town.
The battle between Masters over the Holy Grail.
I chose to fight to stop it, and sacrificed Saber.
...Then I can't sacrifice anyone else.
I have to fight by myself from now on.

"Emiya-kun...? Why are you so quiet?
 Is there something you haven't told me yet?"

"No, that's all. I lost Saber, and I'm not a Master anymore. There's no reason for me to fight you anymore."

"Yeah. If you're out of the Holy Grail War, both our truce and our promise to eventually fight are nullified. So, Emiya-kun..."
"Yeah. I'm out of the war. An amateur like me has no chance of winning without Saber's help."

I stand up.
Leaving Tohsaka behind me, I head for the door.

"Bye, Tohsaka. Watch out for Zouken."
"Hey, Emiya-kun"
I open the door without turning around.
I leave the rooftop as if to cut off my regret.

The day ends.
I have to wait until night even if I am to go after the shadow and Zouken.
As I am much weaker, I will need useful information and a weapon.
...I'll wait until night, sneak into the Ryudou Temple, and try to obtain some information.

"I have to look after Sakura, too. I'll wait until night for now."
Battles can wait.
I want to concentrate on nursing Sakura until then.
...I have some time, so I'll go to the shopping district and buy a few day's worth of groceries.

"I'm home."
I call out as I go into my house.

"?"
...Then.
I feel something strange as soon as I enter.

"Footprints...?"
I see something like footprints on the floor.
It's a trace of someone coming in with shoes on, and the house is free of any human presence.
The only shoes I see are Sakura's, and it seems the housekeeper I asked for has gone home.

"Sakura."
I go into the guest room.
It's empty.
The strange feeling turns into an ominous conviction.

I return to the living room.
Sakura isn't here either.
The footprints end here in the living room.
Whoever the intruder was, he came in, did something here, and went back outside.

"...There's blood."
There's a small trace of blood on the floor, as if someone coughed up blood here.
I get an intuition.
Sakura was here a while ago.
Sakura was in the living room, waiting for my return.

Traces of an intruder.  Traces of blood.
The absence of Sakura, who should be sleeping sick.

That's all.
It's more strange not to draw a conclusion.
The answer is clear if I think about it just a bit.
Calmly.
Calmly.
Calmly.
Calmly think, and I can tell what happened here.

So, why

Why is my head not working at all?

I should've come home earlier.
I should've thought about it more seriously.
Didn't I have Sakura stay over for fear that something like this would happen?

Matou Zouken said Sakura is unrelated.
Why did I believe his words?
There's no way she's unrelated when she's part of the Matou family.

So why?
Why did I believe such a convenient story!?


The phone rings.
My head blank, I pick up the phone with mechanical movements.

"Hello? Are you finally home, Emiya?"

The cheerful voice is that of Matou Shinji.

"What did you do with Sakura?"
"Huh? Oh, I called you because I thought you'd be sad about Sakura not being there, but it seems you're more perceptive than that. That's amazing. You know what's going on before I've told you anything."

"Shut up. What did you do to Sakura?"
"Huh? I only took back what's mine. I can't leave her at someone else's house forever."

"Shinji."
"Haha! That's great, you're getting pissed! You're vexed that I took Sakura!"

Vexed...?
No way. I don't have such extra emotion.

"Don't waste my time. Just tell me what your business is."
"Hehyou should know. Let's decide our match. You don't think that previous fight was the end, right?"

"I do. You ran away. Everything was decided right then."

"It's not decided...! That's the difference in our Servants, not your power! I wouldn't have run away if Saber wasn't there! There's no way I'll lose if Saber doesn't come...!"

If Saber doesn't come...?
...I see. Rider must not have told Shinji that Saber was eliminated.
I don't know what Rider is thinking, but Shinji still thinks I'm a Master.
Ohthat must be why he kidnapped Sakura.
In short, this phone call is to...

"Shinji. What are you going to do with Sakura?"
"Nothing. But that would depend on what you do.
 I won't do anything to Sakura if you come alone. You know what that means, right?"

"Yeah. You want me to fight you without Saber, right?"

"Wow, you're pretty bright today. Look, we'll fight at school. I'll give Sakura back to you if you come alone.
 ...Oh, but don't try to pull any shit with me. Rider set up a boundary field over the school. I'll know right away if you bring Saber along.
 If that happensI can't guarantee what'll happen to her."

"Ow...!"
I hear a sound of him kicking something.

"I'll go right away. Don't do anything else to Sakura."
"Hah...! Fine, I'll take that exchange.
 But still, didn't you take your time coming home?
 You say not to do anything else to Sakura, but even I can't think of any other things to do to her that I haven't already tried."

"What did you do to Sakura, Shinji?"
"Who knows? I got bored with punching her, so I gave her to Rider. It's just like that night. Rider bit Sakura's neck and"

I smack down the receiver.
"You did it, Shinji."
I can still hear his laugh.
I set off for school, my nerves blazing with anger.

I go outside.
The sky is dark, and the sun's about to set.
I bet it'll rain tonight.
I have to come home with Sakura before that.

The school building is deserted.
Thanks to the series of comas, the school closed early.
It's past five o'clock, and there are no students or teachers at the school now.

There's hot steel in my back.
The Magic Circuit is already made.
I concentrate so that I can use my only weapon whenever necessary.

It must be Rider's boundary field.
The school's tinted red, and my lungs are damaged every time I breathe.
I cough up blood.
But I ignore it and run up the stairs.

I'm not certain, but I can still guess.
Considering Shinji, he wouldn't position himself on unfamiliar territory.
He has to be in the classroom on the third floor.

I get up to the third floor.
The red filter condenses, scraping off my magical energy with each step I take.

Was he waiting for me?
Shinji is watching me from the entrance of room 2-C.

"Shinji...!"
"Hahso honest, Emiya.  You came, just like you promised...!"

My brain boils up.
Sakura must be in the classroom.
I have to check if she's all right.
If Shinji would get in my way, I would mercilessly...

"It's your turn, Rider! It's the Master of the one who defeated you...! Repay him for that insult...!"
The black Servant stands in my way.
I don't care.
I can't stop, no matter who may be in front of me.

The dagger is swung.
I read its course with amazing speed and avoid it.
Having dodged the dagger, I pass by Rider next.
It must be because of her tall figure and her long hair, but Rider cannot seize me as I rush past.

Got him.
The distance is about five meters. I close in on Shinji in under two seconds, aim at the Command Spell controlling Rider, and...
".........!!!!?"
My tongue bulges from my mouth.
Something squeezes my neck from behind.

"Phew. What are you doing, Rider!? You call yourself a Servant, letting Emiya do things like this!?"
"......I am sorry. I took his concentration lightly."

I hear Rider's voice from right behind me.
"Guh... kuh, ah...!"
My feet don't reach the ground.
Rider has wrapped a chain about my neck and lifted my body off the floor.

"Hagah, guh......!"
Suspended in the air like this, I can't do anything to resist.
Rider is out of sight behind me, and my neck is already

"You lost because you lost your composure, Saber's Master.
 I cannot entrust Sakura to you. ...Though it is not my will, you must die here."
"Guh, ......"

...My consciousness fades away.
A bit more.
It's only a bit more, but my body is suspended in midair...

...And I hear the sound of my neck breaking.
I have to decide what to do from now on.

I chose to keep fighting.
Matou Zouken and Assassin.
The black shadow wandering around the town.
The battle between Masters over the Holy Grail.
I chose to stop it even without Saber.
Then it shouldn't matter how I do it.
I need Tohsaka's help if I don't want there to be any more victims.

"Tohsaka.
 I lost Saber and my Command Spell. So I'm not a Master anymore, right?"

"...Right. I forgot about that. You're not a Master anymore. You have no reason to be involved in the Holy Grail War, and you're less likely to be attacked by other Masters."

"Yeah. I only wanted the Holy Grail because Saber wanted it. ...I have no interest in it now that Saber's gone."
"I see. Then you're not going to be fighting anymore?"

There's no emotion in Tohsaka's eyes.
Her words are merely something she must ask as a Master, devoid of personal interest.


This is not a question, but a warning.
This is my last chance.
She's providing me with a chance to back out, telling me I'll still make it if I want to withdraw.

"I will fight."
But my mind is made up.
I'll remember her consideration, though.

"I will fight. I won't stop fighting just because I'm not a Master. I chose to fight to stop the war."
"I see. Then I guess we'll still keep our relationship.
 Even though we're enemies, we'll keep our truce in place until the shadow has been beaten."

"...?"
Tohsaka suddenly smiles.
She looks friendly, as if something good has happened.
Well, I don't care, but

"Hold on. Why are we enemies?
 I'm not a Master anymore. There's no reason for us to fight."

"What are you saying? Even if you've lost your Command Spell and your Servant, you're still Saber's former Master.
 You were somehow chosen by the Holy Grail, so you have the right to obtain the Holy Grail until the very end. You're still my rival even though you're powerless."

"Really? Even if I have no intention of obtaining the Holy Grail?"

"That would depend on the situation, right? It's possible that you end up needing the Holy Grail when you're in a situation where you can obtain it, and you inevitably use it.
 Unselfish people are affected by other people because they are unselfish."

"Hm. You're thinking too much, Tohsaka. Even if I end up needing the Holy Grail, that doesn't mean I can obtain it."

"It's just a what-if. But the possibility is there.
 That's why I'm saying we're enemies, and that's why magi that aren't Masters anymore run to the church.
 Even without their Servants, they're still obstacles to the other Masters. Keep that in mind and watch out. It's not just Zouken that wants to kill you."

"Hm...... I appreciate the warning, but..."
Um, I don't like having Tohsaka as an enemy.

"...? Why the difficult face? We're already enemies. Is there a problem with that?"
"Yeah. This means I can't ask for your help after all."

"Huh?"
She freezes.
She looks at me as if she's seen a ghost.

"Why do you need my help...?"

"Because I can't do this by myself. Ending the Holy Grail War means defeating the other Masters, but I don't have the power to do so."

"...I know it looks pitiful, but I don't care about that. I only have a few options, and I think this is the best thing I can do.
 That's why I can't be enemies with you.
 I need you as an ally."

"...Hey. Are you sane, Emiya-kun?"
"I am. I'm too weak to fight alongside you, so I could end up weighing you down.
 I can't offer you anything in return, so there's nothing in it for you if you help me.
 ...Yeah, cooperation like this isn't usually possible."

"H-Heh. So you do understand.
 Equivalent exchange is standard for magi, just like you say. I can't lend something to someone with no money, and I can't help someone who can't help me in return. You know that's for your own good too, right?"

"I gave you advice because we had a truce, but it's a different matter if we're actually allies.  If that were the case, we'd have to share the reward too."

"I know. But I'm asking you anyway, even knowing that.
 Please help me, Tohsaka. I'll pay you back for this as long as I'm alive."

"As long as you're alive?"
Tohsaka looks away and mutters.

...I'm fully aware that I'm only a burden on her.
But Tohsaka is the most reliable person I know, and I can trust her to do no wrong even if she obtains the Holy Grail.
So Tohsaka is the only one I can see winning, and the only one I'm willing to cooperate with.

"Tohsaka. Let me hear your answer."
I look at her straight on.
"...I-It's obvious, right? Even if I team up with someone who's not a Master, I..."

"Tohsaka."
"I said I can't help you even if you ask me like that. First of all..."

"Tohsaka."
"...This is like a real contract."

Then.
Tohsaka looks down once, and...

"Geez, all right! Then here are the terms for our agreement!"
She glares at me.

"...? What do you mean by terms?"
"Terms are terms!
 ...Um, this is a legitimate contract.
 So I'll consider it if you can promise me what I'm going to ask you."

"...??? Tohsaka. I've already told you, I have nothing I can give back to you."
"Just listen to me!"
"......! A-All right, I'll listen."

"Okay. Here's the first one. I don't mind cooperating, but will you do as I tell you?
 Will you obey me, no matter what I tell you to do, during a battle?"
"No. I probably can't obey you unconditionally."
"...Hey now. Who do you think you are, answering like that from the very first question?"
"But isn't it normal? For example, I'd be in trouble if you give me a reckless order."

"I won't be that stupid. If you think it's reckless, it's probably because you don't understand what I'm planning.
 ...Oh well. So you'll obey me, as long as the order's reasonable?"
"Yeah, I can keep that promise."
"Then here's the second question. Can you trust me like I'll be trusting you? Will you stay on my side, no matter how ugly things get?"
"Hm... I won't betray you, of course, but I'm not sure about the last part.
 What do you mean by things turning out ugly?"

"That's obvious, right? I'm talking about dying or coming close to it. You have nothing to give me, so you need to be prepared for such a thing, right?
 Or what? Are you saying I should conveniently give you whatever you ask with nothing in return?"

"Uh, guh. You've got me, Tohsaka."
"Of course. I'm not playing around right now. It's not worth it for me unless you show that much determination."
"...Okay. I'll try my best."
"I see. So you will give me your absolute obedience?"

"Mm."
Tohsaka says something dangerous with an evil smile.
That seems to be the final question, but
"No way...! I'll admit that your instructions are better as a magus. But I'm sure you make mistakes once in a while.
 If you say something ridiculous, I can't just obey you. I'll protest if I think you're wrong. That's what it means to cooperate, right?"

"Of course. I can't cooperate with you unless that's the case.
 I tend to do things my own way, so I need someone to act as my brakes.
 It'll be helpful if you can take that role."

"Huh?"
...I'm a bit disappointed.
I expected disagreeing to spark an argument, but Tohsaka is nodding in satisfaction.

"Then here's the last question.
 I'll help you as much as I can if it's something I can do and you can't do.
 But... can you do the same even in the opposite case?"

"...? Something I can do that you can't do...?"
Is there such a thing?
Is it possible that she can't cook and needs my help?

"Hey. Come on and answer since this is the most important question. Yes or no. Quick."
"...Well. Um, it'll help me out if you can give me a specific example..."

"Geez...! I'm asking if you'll let me win or not!"


She says with her cheeks blushing, as if she's sulking.
It looks childish, completely unlike Tohsaka.

But
"......Yeah.
 I'll let you win since I'm cooperating with you. I promise."
...It's actually really cute.

"Then we'll meet at the front gate after school.
 You're going to have club activities at my place, starting today."
"Hmclub activities at your place?"

"Yup. We're cooperating, so I need to teach you how to fight by yourself, right?
 ...Well, I know from what I've already seen that you're an amateur, so you'll be working overtime every day."

"Well, I don't mind, and that's actually helpful
 But is that starting today?"

"Of course. I have to figure out your ability and determine our plan from tonight on.
 You'll be going home late, but it's no problem since you live alone, right?"
"Huh? Well, that's true, but how do you know that, Tohsaka?"

"...! I-I thought so because there wasn't anyone at your house when I treated your wound before.
 A-Anyway, that's how it's going to be, so you just have to wait for me at the front gate!"


Tohsaka waves goodbye and runs off.
It's Friday today... Classes run to sixth period, so we'll be going home after three o'clock.

"...This is bad. I told Sakura I'd be coming home early, but I can't cancel Tohsaka's proposal on the very first day."
I feel bad for Sakura, but I'll go with Tohsaka for today.

...Well, she isn't a devil.
So she might let me go home early today if I tell her about Sakura.... Right?
Tohsaka's analysis ends rather quickly.
She lit an incense, did something like tarot fortune-telling, and asked me a few personality assessment-like questions.

And Tohsaka says...
"You don't correspond to anything. Further testing would be useless."
...And quickly gives up diagnosing my Magic Circuit.

"Hey. Does that mean you can't tell?"
And when I ask her...

"Excuse me. I found out that you're not related to the five elements. Any more consecration is out of my expertise, so it's useless to keep going.
 I'll just see what magic you can use and figure it out from there."

...That's how it is according to her.
I run through the "strengthening" magic using the clay she prepared.

It's called an ether cluster, and it's a strange object that returns to its original form no matter what happens to it. It's a good conductor of magical energy.
I strengthen it so easily that I'm afraid it won't recover, but...

"It's like shiniku, so don't worry about it. It restores its original state in a day even if you bundle it with strong magical energy."
...She says something like that.
Shiniku, by the way, is meat that never goes away, no matter how much of it you eat.

...Anyway, I keep repeating the strengthening magic on the clay.
I can't fail in front of Tohsaka, but I only succeed two out of ten times.
Activating my Magic Circuit, which was easy when I had Saber, took a lot of time and effort.

Tohsaka asks me a few questions while I cast the strengthening magic.
Whether I'm self-taught, whether I can use any other spells, how Kiritsugu taught me, and what I have the easiest time imagining.

So.
Tohsaka's expression darkens further with each answer I give, and by the end she's shut up entirely.
I don't know what she's angry about, but it's really awkward to be here if she makes a face like that.

"Tohsaka? ...Um, I know it's only a matter of course, but are you regretting cooperating with me because I'm such an amateur?"
I ask her the most likely thing.

"Huh...? Yeah, I do regret that you're an amateur, but in your case, you were taught wrong... Or should I say that I'm surprised you're still alive with the way you're doing things."
Tohsaka ponders.

"...? Heeey, Tohsaka? You lost me."
".........?"
Why is she glaring at me?

"......Fine. I guess if I'm going to correct you, we'll have to start with the fundamentals.  But let's go back to what we were talking about earlier. Is it true that the things you projected are still in your shed?"
"Yeah. Things don't normally go away unless you break them, right?"

I told her that I use projection as a breather in between strengthening magic.
It seems Tohsaka is particular about it, and told me to use projection using the clay.
She told me to make a vase. Everything started out smoothly, but in the end I still failed.

"Hmph. For now, I'll teach you how to turn your switch on and off.
 It's faster to make an actual switch in your body.  Stay over tonight. It's a drastic measure, so you'll have to stay in bed all night."

"What? You mean here?"
"What's with that face? Don't worry. I'm not going to be performing surgery on you. You'll just drink some medicine. Well, you won't be able to move for a while because it's so strong."

"Oh... Um, it's not that I don't like drastic measures..."
...I look at the clock.
It's almost five.
I didn't notice since it's cloudy today, but it's getting late.

Tohsaka is helping me as a fellow magus.
It makes me happy, and I'm grateful, but I'm worried about Sakura too.
I should
...I'm worried about Sakura.
I feel bad, but I should clearly tell her.

"Tohsaka? Would you mind doing that at my house?"
"Huh? At your house?"

 "Yeah. Sakura's lying sick at my house, so I want to go check on her. I won't be able to rest easy while I'm lying in bed unless I'm sure she's all right."

"Crapthat's right."
...She's astonished.
It's only natural. Anyone would get mad if someone asked to cooperate, but told them today is a bad day to train

"You idiot! I wouldn't have kept you here for so long if you'd told me earlier...!"
".........Huh?"
She stands up as soon as she yells at me, then crosses the room and puts on her coat.

"Let's go. We've done everything that has to be done here, and we can do the rest at your place. We'll continue as soon as you're done with nursing Sakura, so let's hurry."
"Eho-okay. That'll help me out."

"...Humph. I'll tell you now since I don't want to have to keep remembering this.
 Your nature is in projection and not strengthening.
 I don't know where you made your mistake or what your misunderstanding is, but you're a magus that belongs on the 'side that creates'."
Tohsaka walks off down the hallway.

"...?"
I tilt my head in wonder, but I follow Tohsaka and leave the Tohsaka household.
...Tohsaka's cooperating with me, so she takes precedence.
I'm worried about leaving Sakura alone in her condition, but today's an exception.

"...Hey, why the painful look?
 You don't mind taking drastic measures, right? Then just give up and accept it."

"...Yeah, I will. But let me make sure, Tohsaka. This thing will end today, right? I'll really be in trouble if I can't move tomorrow."

"...Well. I can't deny that possibility, to be honest. I can't tell how it'll turn out, and it'll take longer if your body has matured to the point where it can't be tampered with. And there's the possibility of the operation itself failing.
 Well, that's all up to your luck. How's your luck recently, Emiya-kun?"

...It's bad.
It's worse still given that the one asking me holds my fate in her hands.

"...Hold on. That's really troublesome.
 I have to go home by tomorrow."
"Huh? Your home?"

 "Yeah. Sakura's lying sick at my house, so I want to go check on her. I won't be able to rest properly in bed if I don't know that she's all right."

"CrapI forgot about it."
...She's astonished.
Tohsaka stares at me, bewildered, and...
"You idiot! I wouldn't have kept you here for so long if you'd told me earlier...!"
...As if trying to get back at me, she gives a bewildering reply.

"We can talk about the switch later! We can do that at your house!"
"W-What...!?"
She yells at me as she crosses the room and puts on her coat.

"Let's go. We're done with what we have to do here, and we can do the rest at your place. We'll continue as soon as you're done with nursing Sakura, so let's hurry."
"Eho-okay. That'll help me out."

"...Humph. I'll tell you now since I don't want to have to keep remembering this.
 Your nature is in projection and not strengthening.
 I don't know where you made your mistake or what your misunderstanding is, but you're a magus that belongs on the 'side that creates'."
Tohsaka walks off down the hallway.

"...?"
I tilt my head in wonder, but I follow Tohsaka and leave the Tohsaka household.
The second hand on the clock ticks loudly, causing her to look up.
It's past four o'clock.
School's already over and he should be home by now even if he went by the shopping district.

"...I wonder what's going on. Senpai sure is late."
She leans on the wall and murmurs absent-mindedly.

"Huh?"
She feels heavy and dizzy.
She's surprised at how quiet her voice is.
The second hand is annoyingly loud, but her words are almost inaudible.
Only simple sounds echo in her ears.
The monotonous ticking of the clock, and the painful thumping of her heart.
The two sounds enter her brain even if she covers her ears, and her dizziness gets worse.

"That's strange... I'm really not sick anymore."
That's why she sent the housekeeper home.
She was down to her normal temperature when she checked it, and she was able to cook her own lunch.
She was just fine after lunch, and she waited eagerly for his return.

"It's hot"
But her whole body is hot now.
The heat source isn't her, so it has to be something else.
Between her blood vessels. Between her muscles where there are no spaces.
Something that's not her is in there, turning like a car engine.
Her fever is so high that it makes her imagine such a thing, and the abnormality is unprecedented.

The sensation is strange and unpleasant.
She isn't the only one that's in pain.
It's shared by the things in her body, crawling through her blood vessels and nerves.
To speak figuratively, it's like a dog looking for the exit to a can filled with meat.
The heat source, the things within her, are trying their best to fulfill their role.
Thinking about that makes them seem charming, and she cannot make herself hate the sensation.

"...The clock's loud..."
She looks up at the clock absent-mindedly.
It's four-thirty.
A bit longer. He should be back in half an hour.
She has to calm down and suppress the things running around inside of her by then.

"...It's fine... It's happened many times before..."
Yes, she is used to this.
She has been disciplined and reformed many times since she was a child.
She tells herself that it will be no trouble this time eitherbut her fever does not go down, and the things within her keep speeding up.

"...No... This is strange, Senpai."
Her body does not calm down.
She has never been able to.
What's missing, what she needs, and what has changed.
She tries hard to think about these questions, but the ticking of the clock keeps distracting her.

"Huh...? This sound..."
When she realizes the sound is not the clock, but a warning from the house itself...
"Oh, Emiya's not here? That's convenient."
A familiar person enters, barefooted.

"Nii-san."
"Huh? Oh, Emiya's not here and you're getting all hot and horny by yourself? Did I use Rider too much, like the old man said?"
He comes into the living room and walks over to the girl leaning against the wall.

"Oh"
She tries to run, but can't muster the strength.
No, she had no will to run away from the start.
Even if she gets awayshe can never truly escape.

"This is your last order, Sakura. You said you'd do anything, right?"
The one looking down at her is smiling.
"Nii-san."
"Let's go. I have to settle my match with Emiya. I'm sure you want to see him cry, so I'll let you see it up close."
The boy grabs her arm and hauls her to her feet.

"NoI don't want to...!"
She tries to get away, but lacks the strength to do so.
The man pulls her in and grabs her neck.

"Don't disobey me so much, Sakura. You're making me want to kill you. You just have to keep obeying me."
"Noit's not as you promised, Nii-san...! You said you wouldn't do anything to Senpai...!"
She protests, her hair disheveled.
He stops her with his foot.
He has let go and kicked her stomach.

"Uhguh......"
Collapsing to the ground, she lets out a moan.
"I'm being kind. I have the medicine I got from the old man, but I'm not using it."
He forces her to her feet.

"Ah... Ah, uh"
He grabs hold of the coughing girl's neck once again.
"Don't worry, I'll keep my promise. I won't tell him about what happened. But I won't be satisfied until he gets hurt."
He puts his mouth close to her cheeks and whispers in delight.

", Uh"
With her neck held, she shuts her mouth in vexation.
She tries to accept this turn of events, thinking that it always ends up this way.

"Yeah, that's right. Let's go ahead, Sakura. This is Emiya's territory. We have to be in my territory if we're going to play around. Rider, bring this woman with me."
Giving her a violent shove, he exits.
"Ri... der..."
The girl raises her head.
There stands a Servant with long hair.

"I'm home!"
I raise my voice as I go into the house.

...Then.
I feel something strange as soon as I enter.

"The hallway, Emiya-kun."

She doesn't even need to tell me.
There are footprints on the floor.
The only shoes I see are Sakura's.
The housekeeper's aren't there, and the house is dead silent.

"Sakura."
I go into the guest room.
It's empty.
The strange feeling turns into an ominous conviction.

I return to the living room.
Sakura isn't here either.
The footprints end here in the living room.
Somebody came in here with his shoes on, did something in this room, and then went back outside.

"...Emiya-kun. Look at the floor there.
 It's small, but there's a trace of bl"
"I know. Sakura was here."
Yes, I know.
Sakura was waiting for me alone in the living room, but is not here now.

There are unfamiliar footprints in the hallway.
That's all.
It's more strange not to draw a conclusion.
The answer is clear if I think about it just a bit.

Calmly.
Calmly.
Calmly.
Calmly think, and I can tell what happened here.
 So, why
"!"
Why is my head not working at all?

"H-Hey, Emiya-kun...!?"

I should've come home earlier.
I should've thought about it more seriously.
Didn't I have Sakura stay over for fear of just this situation?
Matou Zouken said Sakura is unrelated.
Why did I believe his words?
There's no way she's unrelated when she's part of the Matou family.

So why?
Why did I believe such a convenient story!?


The phone rings.
I nod at Tohsaka and slowly pick up the receiver.

"Hello? Are you finally home, Emiya?"

It's Shinji.
There's no mistake about it, and I knew this was what happened.

"What have you done with Sakura?"
"Huh? I only took back what's mine.  I can't leave her at someone else's house forever."

"Shinji."
"Haha! That's great, you're getting pissed! You're vexed that I took Sakura!"

Tohsaka must be able to hear Shinji's voice, because she's leaning forward.
I raise a hand to stop her and urge him to go on.

"Don't waste my time.  Just tell me what your business is."
"Hehyou should know. Let's decide our match. You don't think that last fight was the end, do you?"
"I do. You ran away. Everything was decided right then."

"It's not decided...! That's the difference in our Servants, not your power! I wouldn't have run away if Saber wasn't there! There's no way I'll lose if Saber doesn't come...!"

If Saber doesn't come...?
...I see.
Rider must not have told Shinji that Saber was eliminated.
Ohthat must be why he kidnapped Sakura.
In short, this phone call is...

"Shinji. What are you going to do with Sakura?"
"Nothing. But that would depend on what you do.
 I won't do anything to Sakura if you come alone. You know what that means, right?"
"!"
I stop Tohsaka.
If she interrupts now, there's no telling what Shinji will do.

"So you want me to fight you without Saber?"
"Yeah, I'm glad you're perceptive when it counts.
 We'll fight at school. Come alone, okay? Rider set up a boundary field over the school. I'll know right away if you bring Saber along.
 If that happensI can't guarantee what'll happen to her."

"Ow...!"
I hear the sound of him kicking something.

"I'll go right away. But just in case, I want to know one thing. Are you a Master, or are you Sakura's brother?"
"Hah...! Are you joking? Why would I be this shit's brother? Well, she's not completely useless because I can lure you out like this."

"All right.
 I'm going to go fight you as a Master."
"Yeah, if it ends up being a fight."

I put the phone down.
I start off right away.

"Hold on...!
 Are you really going to go alone!?"
"That's what he wanted. We can talk later, Tohsaka."

"That's my line.
 Shinji has Sakura as a hostage.
 You'll be killed if you go. Seeing you die will be unbearable for Sakura. We should wait and see, and come up with a plan."

I know.
But we don't have time.
I can still hear her moans in my mind.

"I see. Would Shinji kill me in front of Sakura?"
"Hm... I don't know, but that's highly possible since he's using Sakura as a hostage. ...Hey, are you all right, Emiya-kun? You look calm, but don't tell me you've actually lost your cool."

I've lost my cool?
Is she asking me if I can only think about going to school and punching Shinji in the face?
Oh, then

"Yeah. I can't think of anything else. I'm mad at myself for not saying anything because I thought it was a family matter.
 He said he's not her brother. Such a guy took Sakura."

"He took her, so I'm going to go take her back. Don't do anything, Tohsaka."

I go outside.
The sky is dark, and the sun's about to set.
I bet it'll rain tonight.
I have to come home with Sakura before that.
"Ah."
I throw away the knife.
Trying not to look at the blood, I run to where Sakura is sitting.

"Sakura...!"
"...Senpai"
Sakura doesn't raise her head to look at me.

...She's trying to avoid talking to me.
I don't know if it's because of Shinji, or because of all the things I've hidden from her.
All I can tell is that Sakura's body is hotter than this morning.

"...It's fine. Let's talk later.
 We'll go home for now and"
"...!"
"It's over. The match is decided, Shinji."

...Then.
I realize that Tohsaka is behind me.

After being wounded by Archer, Rider is crouching down on the floor.
 Her clothes are wet with blood.  Even though it's not fatal, she shouldn't be able to continue fighting.

"T-Tohsaka...!?
 Damn, that's not fair! You broke your promise, Emiya...! I told you to come alone!"

"Yeah. But that was an order, not a promise, right? Then I think it's illogical to call it unfair."

"TThat's sophistry! It's natural for him to come alone since he said he'll come alone!"

"...That's fine.
 We were together, but Emiya-kun didn't ask me for help. I came here because I wanted to."

"You're lying...! Why are you here if he didn't get you!?
 Emiya acted honest and tricked me!"

"Oh, that? That's simple. I was next to him when you called. You had such a loud voice, Matou-kun. I was able to hear you even though Emiya-kun was trying to hide it."

"Do you understand now? There's no way I'd just sit there if Sakura's been kidnapped. You lured Emiya-kun to you at the price of making me your enemy."

"Kuhso you're here for Sakura too?
 ...Sakura. Sakura, Sakura, Sakura, SakuraSakuraSakuraSakuraSakura...!
 I don't believe this! Are you still concerned about it!? She's just a quiet bitch that shrinks with fear! Look, I'm a Master!
 You shouldn't worry about them! You should just be concerned about me...!!"

"I see. Then why don't you make your Servant fight?
 Archer only cut her stomach. He hasn't destroyed the core of her embodiment, her neck or her heart. Go ahead and heal Rider if you're a legitimate Master."
"Kuhdamn you...!"

Shinji scrambles away and takes out a book.
"That's"
That's Shinji's Command Spell that burned up at that park.
He still has it...!?

"Get up, Rider! It's your Master's order! Get up and beat Archer...!"

There's no reply.
Rider is crouching, motionless.

A puddle of blood is under her, and the blood keeps flowing.
She is the one who needs help right now.
To order her to fight is to hasten her death.

"Damn...! You're my Servant, so fight until you die, you bitch...!"

Shinji's fingers tighten on the book.
That must be how he uses his Command Spell.  With trembling movements, Rider tries to stand.

"Stopthat's enough, Shinji, give up...! Rider will die if you push her any more...!"
"Hah! Servants don't die that easily! You just shut up and take care of that piece of trash...!"

Shinji does not relent.
"......!"
I let go of Sakura and rush him again.

At that instant...
"...No...! No more...!"

"Sakura?"
I stop and turn back.
Clutching her stomach, she moans as if in the throes of a nightmare.

"Wha!?"
Shinji's book burns to ashes, just as it did that night.

"What?"
Wind blows inside the enclosed hallway.
It's coming from Rider, who was lying on the ground, and from Sakura, who is still crouching.

"No way. This is Rider...?"
Tohsaka stands ready while Archer silently watches the enemy that stood up.
Rider is completely healed.
The power flowing from her body is just like when she was at the Ryudou Temple.

"?"
Then.
Her figure disappears.
Rider suddenly disappears from my vision...

"Get down, Emiya-kun!"
"...!"

The moment I duck, long hair flutters right above me.

"Sakura...!"
Rider has instantly jumped with Sakura in hand.
She lands opposite usbetween Shinji and the rest of us.

"Huh? ...What are you doing? Who told you to bring Sakura?"
"No, there was no such order. As a Servant, I merely protected my Master."

Rider lets Sakura down and glances at Shinji.
...Her eyes are covered with a leather mask, but her expression is frighteningly cold.

"D-Don't be stupid. I'm your Master. Why are you wasting time instead of protecting me"
"Shinji. A Command Spell appears on the body of a Master. I have never accepted anyone who does not bear the holy sign as my Master."

"What?"
"You are a fraud. You have lost the book which granted you false ownership, so I can no longer obey you."

Rider turns away from Shinji.
That motion tells Shinji that she will never look at him again.

"I see. So that's how it was, Rider?"
"Your guess is correct, Archer's Master.
 You already knew, did you not?"

"...Yeah. I knew it was strange.
 There's no way one of the Matous would be chosen as a Master.  Their bloodline has grown thin, so no magi should be born to them."

"So it shouldn't be possible for Shinji, one of the Matou family, to become a Master. But Rider was summoned, and a person from the Matou household was chosen as a Master."

"...Yes. I thought Matou Zouken summoned you and entrusted you to Shinji.
 But it's actually much more simple. Zouken doesn't need to do anything. Because the most appropriate person in the Matou household to be a Master is"

Tohsaka isn't looking at Rider.
She is only looking at...
"The legitimate successor of Matou.
 This generation's magus of the Matou line. It's you, Sakura."
"......"
She's looking straight at Sakura.

"Huh?"
I can't say anything.
Tohsaka and Sakura.
I can only look at them alternately and try to figure out what was just said.

...My left hand hurts.
My relaxed mind finally starts to inform me of the pain on my hand.


I see.
It seems my mind is calm.
Tohsaka's words and the sight of the Command Spell on Sakura's left hand have numbed my senses, butmy mind isn't surprised at all.

Only... why?
Why did such a thing happen?

"........."
Sakura is hanging her head as if trying to hide.
Judging by her body language, she didn't want me to know.

"...Transfer of a Command Spell. A Command Spell ordering her to obey Matou Shinji, huh?
 Rider became Shinji's Servant with that, and you lost your right as a Master at the same time, becoming an ordinary magus. ...So when I first had you show me your arm, you'd already given your Command Spell to Shinji."

"............"
Sakura doesn't answer and bites her lips.

Then.

"Damn, again, Sakura! Give me the right to control her again!"
Shinji runs to her as if begging her.

"............"
"Hey, say something! You don't want to fight, right? You said you didn't want to be a Master, so that's why I took over in your place!
 Why are you pretending to be a good girl now...!?"

Shinji raises his arm.
...But there's no need for me to stop him.
"R-Riderare you going to disobey me?"
"You are not my Master, Shinji. If you intend to harm Sakura, I will kill you."

Rider releases him.
Shinji backs away, clutching his arm where Rider gripped it.

"Ha, hahaI see. You'll regret that, Rider. No matter what you say, everything will be back to normal when Sakura makes another book.
 Do you know what'll happen to you once you become my Servant again?"

"It's useless, Shinji. It's almost impossible to entrust a Servant to a human, and someone that's not a magus at that. The transfer using the Command Spell made it possible."

"Y-Yeah. There's one more Command Spell.
 Sakura won't disobey me, so..."

"That's why this is it. Sakura only has one more Command Spell. If you use it, you'll have no way to control Rider.
 Rider would be freed. You can't bind a Servant with a fake right made with a Command Spell. It'll just burn your book like earlier even if you order Rider."

"Wha Then I'm..."
"Yes. You lost your chance to be a Master.
 No, you were never a Master as you were only controlling her using a fake Command Spell."

...A crack runs through.
With a sound, the existence of Matou Shinji breaks.

"HaHa. I see, so it was impossible from the beginning. I have no talent. The old man cast me aside as a failure, and I was pitied.
 ...Yeah, it's only natural. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it...! I knew from the beginning that I'm not suited!"

"Nii-san."
"No, don't worry about it, Sakura. This was all just a farce. I knew that I have no talent. You're the family's heir. There was no need for me to butt in."

"Nii-san."
"Yeah, I know, I know.
 So, Sakurayou continue."

"Huh...?"
"I'm telling you to beat them

 in my place! Look, Emiya and Tohsaka are enemies! You're the successor of Matou, so act like one...!"

"Shinjihaven't you heard a thing I've said?
 Sakura won't fight, and you have no right. We won't attack you, since you don't have Rider anymore. Just stay in hiding until the Holy Grail War ends."

"I'm not asking you. Come on, Sakura. I'm telling you. You're going to obey me like always, right?"

"......"
There's no reply.
Sakura clenches her fists, turns her back to Shinji, 
"...I don't want to. Let's stop, Nii-san."
and clearly refuses his order.

"Sakura. What did you just say?"
"...I don't want to. You broke your promise. You said you wouldn't kill Senpai, but you broke our promise.
 So"


Sakura doesn't turn to look at Shinji.
Shinji looks at it like someone else's matter and laughs.


I feel a chill, and in that instant...
"All right. Then you can die."
I hear the sound of glass breaking.

"Ahh!"
Sakura falls.
Her knees lose strength and she falls to the ground.

"Hah, bye, Sakura! If you're going to hold a grudge, don't hold it at me, but hold it against that old man for making your body like that. Well, you were gonna end up like that anyway. It's better for you to be freed from the pain now!"
Shinji runs away.

"Ahha, ah!"
Sakura tears at her chest.
Her earring breaks and chemical-like liquid is pouring out of it.

"Ahnono......!"
She goes into convulsions.
No, it's worse.
Sakura's shaking so bad that it seems like she's going to crumble like a building in an earthquake.

"Sakura...!"
I don't get what's going on.
In my worry, I run to her.

"Fool! Don't you understand what's going on!?"
"...!"
Someone stops me.
I don't know when he got here, but Archer is grabbing my shoulder.

"Get away from here. You will not be able to restore her if you feed her without care."
Archer pushes me back and says something strange.

"Feed her...? What do you mean?"
The question dies in my throat.


The hallway tints red.
The air becomes a mist, moistening our skin, and every wall starts to sweat like honey.

"Ow, guh!?"
...My chest is burning.
This air.
This red world is a different world made by magic.
This must be a boundary field that melts everything within its framework, on this premise.

"Tohsaka, this is"
I can't breathe.
No, the mist clogs my throat and burns me from the inside when I breathe.

"...It's the boundary field Shinji set up here.
 But it's much stronger now that Sakura is Rider's Master."
"Wha"

I look.
...On the other side of the hallway is Sakura, clawing at her chest in agony, and Rider, who is confronting Archer to protect Sakura.

"Move aside, Rider. Your master is running wild. She will be addicted to it unless she is stopped before she gets a taste of another's magical energy."
"I refuse. My role is to protect my Master. I cannot let you through as long as you are trying to kill Sakura."

"...Oh. So you will stand there and let your master die? Your Master is using up magical energy at a high rate. Do you understand that she will certainly die if you leave her alone?"

"No. She can avoid death if she takes in more magical energy than she loses.
 Fortunately, there are two magi here. Shinji escaped, but they cannot escape now. I shall take your Master before Sakura is consumed."

"Hehso your character doesn't change even with a new Master, huh?
 It seems you value yourself over other people's lives."
"That goes for you too. You are trying to protect your Master by ignoring mine."
"I seethen there's no need for either one of us to hold back!"

Archer charges.
...Without heed for the corrosive boundary field, he rushes at where Sakura still crouches on the ground.
And he clashes with Rider as she blocks his way.

"Heyare you okay with this, Tohsaka!? He started fighting with Rider...!"
"...Of course they have to fight. We won't last like this. ...And as a fellow magus, I have to prevent Sakura from becoming a heretic."

"Huh?"
Heretic...?
Are those people who use magic against the law of the Association, or people who cannot stop the Magic Circuit and destroy themselves...?

"Wait. What is that? Why Sakura?"
"She's running wild. Rider made this boundary field, but Sakura's the one maintaining it. I don't know what Shinji did, but Sakura's attacking indiscriminately now."

"...I bet Sakura is like us. It's just painful and she just wants air, so she's sucking on other people's air, or magical energy in this case. I can't leave her be as the supervisor of Fuyuki."

"Wha? You can't leave her be? What are you going to do to Sakura!?"
"...Ask Archer. I only know of one way to stop a magus like that. But Archer might know of some other way."

"...Well, we have to do something about Rider before that anyway. From what I can see, Archer is the stronger of the two, but it seems his output is down."
"...Output is down?"

I look back at the hallway.
Archer is overwhelming, even in my eyes.
In terms of pure power, he is stronger. There's no way that Rider can hold him back.


But.
It's strange.

Rider's strength is her agility.
She shouldn't be good at fights where she has to protect someone.
Being forced to protect someone should put her at a disadvantage.
Archer should've already defeated her and moved on to Sakura.
But that's not the caseso could Rider be overwhelming him...?

"Fu!"
Archer's sword swings through empty air.
Her hair flowing as she moves, Rider arches back and avoids the attack, then steps in and slashes at Archer.

But Rider isn't the only one who attacks and defends at the same time.
Archer repels Rider's dagger with his other sword and pushes her back.

Advance and retreat.
They are evenly matched. Archer cannot press forward, Rider cannot force him back, and they consequently clash swords without any progress.

"Kuh"
The impatient one is Archer.
Though his enemy is weaker than him, he cannot repel her, and the boundary field is slowly taking his energy.

And to add, Tohsaka and I are at our limits.
Just stopping our breaths is painful, so being in the hallway stabs at our minds.
At this pace, we'll fall before Archer defeats Rider.

"Damn"
Archer clucks his tongue in annoyance.
There.

"I understand your power.
 I am sorry, but you cannot defeat me."
Rider stops and makes an announcement in a regretful voice.

"What...?"
"I said you cannot beat me. You are not using your Noble Phantasm. I do not know if your Master has forbidden you from doing so or if you are concerned for Sakura's safety.
 Regardless, if you will not use it, this is it. You cannot defeat me."

Planting her feet, her only weapon, Rider confronts Archer.
...She looks so defenseless that the match could be decided if Archer attacked her now.

"...Hah. I'm not worried for your Master. I just think that there is no need.
 And you cannot use your Noble Phantasm either. Matou Shinji was your Master until just now, so you do not have enough magical energy stocked up to use it."

"Yes. Shinji could not give me magical energy. So I cannot use my Noble Phantasm right now."

"...That's right. There's no need to waste my magical energy against an opponent who will not use it. I will slash you with my next attack, proceed and slash that girl, and everything will end."

"Yes. Let's say that's how it will be.
 It will be easier for me to kill you if that is the case."
Rider answers calmly.

What does she intend to do?
Without even readying her weapon, Rider stands against Archer...
"...No, Rider...!"
...but stops when she hears the voice.

"Please endure there, Sakura. I will solve everything."
"Stopplease stop, Rider. I didn't call for you for something like this."
"...I cannot follow that order. Your life takes priority above all else."

Rider raises her arm.
There's four meters between her and Archer.
Maintaining that distance, the black Servant puts her hand on her wrap text="face"]face and...

"Also...
 This is what you wished for, Sakura."
...She releases the black seal.

  Everything solidifies at that instant.

Rider's naked eyes.
They are inhuman eyes, one of the highest rank among numerous mystic eyes.


Grey eyes.
They look like crystals, and they are too abnormal to be called eyeballs.

The corneas do not take in light.
The pupil sees the world through a square.
The iris is solidified, not allowing the eyes to close.
The millions of cells that make up the retina are composed of ether.

Are they art that the gods admired, or are they nature that the gods cursed?
Rider's gray eyes are abnormal, and at the same time, too beautiful for any human to have.

 "!"
Archer is frozen in place.
...It must be because he saw her eyes from such close range.
His eyes are frozen even if he wants to close them, and his arms are frozen even if he wants to cover his eyes.
He tries to charge forward and slash at Rider, but his legs are already petrified up to his knees.

"No way, mystic eyes of petrification...!?"
Tohsaka's voice is almost a scream.
...I can't tell what kind of face she's making.
My eyes are also captivated by Rider's mystic eyes, and I can't look away.
My blood is thickening.
The flow is solidified, and my senses are ceased.

Mystic eyes.
A single action magic that magi have.

It takes the eyes, passive receptors of the world, and makes them function actively to influence the world.
It indiscriminately casts its magic upon anyone within sight, though the effect is vastly increased if the target meets your gaze.
In short, it's something not to be looked at, and it is a frightening magical nature that entraps anyone that looks at them.

Their abilities and concealable nature make the mystic eyes proof of a first-rate magus.
The technique to make one's own eyes into a Magic Circuit is close to that of a Magic Crest.

But then, artificial mystic eyes only have strong enough powers to cast Charm or Whisper.
Possessors of truly powerful mystic eyes are always born with them.

Binding. Coercion. Contract. Burning. Illusion. Extreme luck.
Mystic eyes that directly intervene with another's fate are called Noble Color, and among the highest-ranked of them are the eyes of petrification.

No magus of this age possesses these eyes.
There are only a few magi that make petrification magic possible.
How great a miracle is it to be possible to petrify others just by looking?

...Breaker Gorgon.
It is the curse of the gods sealed by the powers of shrines.
It is said that such evil eyes were only possessed by evil beasts and spirits in the age of the gods.
The magical Noble Phantasm that can petrify people with its glance, the symbol of the heroic spirit Medusa!

"Get away, Rin! The real attack is coming...!"
Archer screams, his body now petrified up to his waist.
...Beyond him...
A dark-red wave is expanding from within Rider, who has released her mystic eyes.

"Wait... even if you tell me...!"
Tohsaka is moving too slowly.
Something terrible is flowing forth from the other side of the hallway.
The wave becomes sharp like a spear and aims straight at Tohsaka.


She'll die.
Tohsaka must be more entranced than me, as she cannot even move a step.
Unable to dodge, she will be impaled by the spear.
With the scene of several seconds in the future in mind, I...
There's no time to think.
I can still move my legs and arms.
Then I just need to move forward and pull Tohsaka

"Tohsaka!"
"What?"
Tohsaka doesn't even budge when I grab her arm and pull.
It seems she's heavier than she looks.

"Damn, you're heavy!"
She doesn't move even when I pull with both my arms.
Then all that's left is...
"Damn, just move!"
I charge at her to push her away...!

"Ow."
I hear a dull piercing sound.

"W-What are you doing!?"
"Toh"
I can't hear her voice clearly.

...My body is burning.
Everything is hazy, as though I have a high fever.

"Senpai?"

...A familiar voice from a distance.
My sense of reality is fading.
My mind whites out and my left arm bleeds red, mixing like paint.

"No."

I see Sakura staring at me as I fall to the floor.

"Nooooooo...!!!"

And she falls to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut.

"How do you feel? Have you calmed down?"

Sitting on the church's long bench, I nod silently.

"I see. Then there's no need for treatment. Your wounds should all heal as your energy returns, so just rest for now."

Tohsaka sits a bit away from me.
...The distance between our minds is much greater than this.
There's no idle conversation as we wait for Kotomine.

"!"
My left hand screams with pain when I clench it.
It feels like there's a nail driven through my palm.
The cut from grabbing the knife hurts more than the bruises from Rider or the stab wound from Sakura.

The dark clouds block the view of the night sky.
The rain clouds tell me that it's going to rain soon.

"......"
...I guess the spear-like thing that attacked Tohsaka was Sakura's magic.

The magical nature that the Matou household inherits is "absorption".
When lack of magical energy made Sakura suffer, she unconsciously cast the spell.
She probably aimed at Tohsaka because she had the most magical energy there.
It stabbed and entangled around my arm because I pushed Tohsaka away, and it sucked all the magical energy out of me.

Magical energy is life force.
It's natural for me to lose consciousness when it's sucked out of me.
I'd already used up my energy when I fought Rider, so I easily fell unconscious, and Tohsaka brought me to the church after that.
...I hear Sakura fainted when she saw me fall.

"She attacked herself."
Tohsaka murmurs and explains to me that she's getting treated in the back right now.
I'm the only one who can move.
Archer and Tohsaka are sealed by Rider's mystic eyes.
Then I just need to get the main cause!

I run at Rider.
Even if I can't beat her, I should at least be able to make her look away from Archer for a second...!

"...!? Are you stupid...!? Don't look directly at her...!"
I ignore Archer's voice and run at Rider.

If those are mystic eyes of petrification, I just need to close my eyes.
The hallway is small.
I know how much distance there is between us.
Rider can attack me or I can haphazardly attack her. Either way, Archer should be able to do something during that opening...!

But my legs freeze.
    No, they are literally petrified.

"Wh"
It's not just my legs.
The petrification does not stop and reaches my waist, hardens my chest, destroys my arms, and locks up my closed eyes forever.
"Why?"

"How foolish.
 Trying to block my mystic eyes by merely closing your eyes. It doesn't matter if you look at me with your naked eyes or your mind's eye, as it is a curse to look at me in any way."

", "
I can't move my throat or my mouth.
...I can't even tell what's going on.
Even if Tohsaka screamed, or if Archer fell to the ground...
I have no way to know, as I'm petrified.

My body has turned to stone, and my mind is swiftly following.
...The three sisters from the legend are immortal.
Just like them, my body will never change.
My legs won't move.
I can't move and can only watch as the black spear pierces Tohsaka...
"What?"
And I see it change its course at the last second.

The weapon wavers.
The weapon that came flying at Tohsaka changes its direction at the very last moment.
The black spear rotates.
As if it has found better prey, it lances towards me.

"Ow."
A dull piercing sound.
...My body is burning.
My vision is wavering as if I have a high fever.

"Senpai?"

...A familiar voice from a distance.
My sense of reality is fading.
My mind whites out and my left arm bleeds red, mixing like paint.

"No."

I see Sakura staring at me as I fall to the floor.

"Nooooooo...!!!"

And she falls to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut.

"How do you feel? Have you calmed down?"

Sitting on the church's long bench, I nod silently.

"I see.  Then there's no need for treatment.  Your wounds should all heal as your energy recovers, so just rest for now."

Tohsaka sits a bit away from me.
...The distance between our minds is much greater than this.
There's no idle conversation as we wait for Kotomine.

"!"
My left hand screams with pain when I clench it.
It feels like there's a nail driven through my palm.
The cut from grabbing the knife hurts more than the bruises from Rider or the stab wound from Sakura.

The dark clouds block the view of the night sky.
The rain clouds tell me that it's going to rain soon.

"......"
...I guess the spear-like thing that attacked Tohsaka was Sakura's magic.

The magical nature that the Matou household inherits is "absorption".
When lack of magical energy made Sakura suffer, she unconsciously cast the spell.
It stabbed and entangled around my arm because Sakura needed help, and it sucked all the magical energy out of me.

Magical energy is life force.
It's natural for me to lose consciousness when it's sucked out of me.
I'd already used up my energy when I fought Rider, so I easily fell unconscious, and Tohsaka brought me to the church after that.
...I hear Sakura fainted when she saw me fall.

"She attacked herself."
Tohsaka murmurs and explains to me that she's getting treated in the back right now.
I smell rain.
The plaza is empty, and no one is visiting the church.
There...

Stands a man, waiting for me without his master.

"Archer."
I strangely don't wonder....
Why he's here and why he's waiting for me.

The red knight silently stares at me and closes his eyes once as if to part with something.
"You know, right, Emiya Shirou?
 What you are fighting against, and who you must kill."

He clearly states the question I must answer.


His words freeze my heart.
...I know.
I vowed to fight to stop the war, to stop Masters who involve innocent people.

That was my decision, and that's why I asked for Saber's help.
I can't go back on my word.
ThenSakura is the Master I should be stopping first.


I know, but I can't say anything.

The knight in red remains silent.
We stand there staring at each other under the gray sky.

"......Then do as you wish. My goal has changed. Now that the thing has appeared, it is not the time to be caring about personal grudges."
"What......?"

"...This is a warning.
 If you're going to protect the belief you've had until now, that's fine.
 Butif you choose another path, there will be no future for Emiya Shirou."
"Does that mean I'm going to die?"

"If you equate self-imprisonment with death.
 Isn't that right? You have existed until now to let people live. How can you throw away that oath and discard everyone to save one person?"

His declaring words contain no scorn.
Archer's words contain determination and emptiness.

"I don't know which path Emiya Shirou will choose.
 But if you are to deny everything you've done to save one personthe crime will definitely judge you."

...Archer leaves.
Unable to stop him, I start down the hill, paralyzed by indecision.

When I finally come back to myself, I'm sitting on the bench in the park.
I don't feel like going home, and I can't wait at the church.

This park is far away from both.
...It's been a few hours since I found out Sakura is a Master.
Its location suits an indecisive guy like me.


An answer.
I have to come up with an answer, but my brain is so messed up that I can't even come up with what I should be thinking about.

She has suffered sexual abuse. It is easy to imagine what kind of training Matou Zouken imposed on her.
 To be blunt,  Matou Sakura is not a pure virgin, but a woman who has known men

".........Shut... up."
Don't repeat it.  I understand.
I'm a magus, even if I'm just an amateur.
I know what it means, and I can tell what Sakura has been through

That girl tried to hide that fact from you, but always sought salvation. Someone who sat by, oblivious, has no right to care for her

"Shut up, shut up, shut up...! I know. You don't have to tell me such a thing!"
...Such a thing...
Why couldn't I notice it?

"......!"
One of my back teeth cracks.
I grit my teeth too much today. It's a wonder it didn't break until now.

"DamnDamn, damn, damn!"
I grind on the bare nerves.
Pain assails my brain.
But it can't even drown out the hatred in my brain.


A fire ignites inside my head.
Now that I know the truth, thinking about our time together drives me crazy.

Sakura was smiling.
She was always smiling gently.
I never knew what kind of pain she went through, and I accepted her as a matter of course.

...I don't care if her smiles were real or fake.
It makes me want to kill him, just thinking about what kind of pain was hidden behind her smiles.

"Matou Zouken!"
I can't forgive him.
I don't need recompensation. I want to eliminate him and remove him from Sakura's life.

Because everything is his fault.
Sakura would've been able to live as a normal girl, and she would've never had a crest worm in her body if it wasn't for him.
She wouldn't have become a Master, and Shinji wouldn't have lost himself if Zouken didn't exist.
So...
If he had never existed, none of this would've happened!

I punch the bench.
The wound on my hand opens up, and blood drips down onto the white bench.
The clear colors transfer into my head.

"How stupidwhat would've happened if he didn't exist?"
I'm disgusted with my own foolishness.

"...That has nothing to do with this. Why am I pushing the responsibility onto someone else?"
Why am I trying to make myself feel better?
I won't deny what Matou Zouken has done to Sakura.
Just thinking about it disgusts me.  It makes me jealous, as if something important has been taken away.

But it doesn't lessen my guilt.
I'm the one who didn't notice.
No matter what Zouken did, it's my fault for not noticing.

"No. It's not that I didn't notice. I..."
I just didn't try to notice.
The night when I confronted Zouken.
He said Sakura was unrelated, and I believed him.

...How stupid of me.
Why did I believe his words?
There's no way she'd be unrelated when she's of the Matou family.
On the night I lost Saber, I realized Matou Zouken is a monster who doesn't care about other people's lives.

If that monster gave Rider to Shinji, there's no way he'd do nothing to Sakura.

But...
I believed his words because they were convenient for me.

I could've easily realized it.
It's something I could've guessed with even a little thought.
...That's why I wasn't surprised.
I knew it was obvious when I found out Sakura's a Master and that she's been raped until now.
But I didn't think about it because I couldn't keep going if I realized it.

If I realized, I'd have to fight.
If Matou Zouken is evil...
The superhero has to fight against him.


...No.
It's clear what I must do.
If Sakura is going to be Zouken's puppet and use Rider to indiscriminately attack people, it's clear what I must do.

That's why I learned magic.
I've been able to live because I have to save people from unreasonable disasters.

"!"
So it's clear.
It's just like that red knight said.

Senpai. If I become a bad person

I don't want to hurt Sakura, and I feel sympathy.
But there can be no exceptions.
No matter how important it is to me, if it would create a disaster like that time...

Yes. I wouldn't mind if you do so.

"Uh, guh......!"
...I just need to eliminate it.
I shouldn't have to think twice, so why...
"Haa, uh, guh!"
Why am I desperately trying to keep myself from throwing up...?

"Ahhaa... haa, haa, haa"
I endure the nausea.
...How long has it been?
I don't have time to be worrying about stupid things.
Tohsaka said she'd be back when the surgery ends.
The town smells like rain.
I have to go back to the church before it starts raining, find out how Sakura's doing, and

"Let's play, Shirou!"
I'm suddenly embraced from behind.

"...Ilya."
I can tell without turning around.
The one I meet at this park is always this white girl.

"Heehee, were you surprised? I had to greet you because I saw you."
Ilya laughs cheerfully.


Her innocence is painful right now.
I know it's selfish of me, but I don't want anyone smiling in front of me right now.

"Oh. What's going on, Shirou? Why are you ignoring me? It's rude to keep looking down when a girl's talking to you."
"......"
...I wish she'd be quiet.
I don't have the composure to talk with someone right now.

"Humph. Hey, Shirou! You have to listen when people talk to you!"
"......Ilya. I'm sorry, but I can't afford to do so right now.
 If you want to play, you'll have to do it by yourself."

"What? I got to see you, so that's boring.
 You never came here after that day. If I let you go today, I bet you won't come again."

"...I didn't promise to meet you here every day. And it's night already. Don't Masters kill each other at night?"

My unkind words bring a renewed wave of nausea.
...I hate myself so much that I want to punch myself.
I'm driving Ilya away so that I can be at ease.

"Why? You're not a Master anymore, right? So I'm going to let you go for tonight."
"'I'm not a Master anymore'... Ilya?"

"Hah. There's nothing I don't know about. You lost Saber, and Rin was almost defeated by Rider. But Rider's Master collapsed, so there are only two more left."
Ilya speaks cheerfully.


It looks like she knows about Sakura's condition and...

"It's obvious now who's going to win. Rider's Master will self-destruct, and Archer isn't a big deal.
 No one can beat my Berserker now that Saber's gone.
 See, so let's play! You're not a Master anymore, so I'll specially invite you to my castle!"

Ilya hugs me without reserve.
Seeing her innocent smile makes me so angry that...
"Shut up...! I said I don't have such time! Go play by yourself if you want to play around!"
"Kya...!?"
I push Ilya away in a fit of rage.

"Oh"
It's too late to regret what I've done.
Ilya is standing there in shock.
I can tell without looking how shocking that must've been for her.

...I have pushed aside an honest, pure show of affection.
It's like a parent rejecting a child.
I have just ruined everything Ilya felt for me.


She stares at me in silence.

"......"
Unable to hold her gaze, I look down
"I'm sorry, Shirou."
A small hand pats my head.

"...What?"
I raise my head again.
Ilya is looking at me with a worried expression.

"......Ilya. Aren't you going to get mad?"
"No. You're about to cry, Shirou. I don't know what happened, but it'd be too bad for you if I hate you. So I'll be your ally no matter what you do."


My vision is covered in white.
...It's just one phrase.
But that phrase washes everything away from my head.

"My... ally?"
"Yeah. It's natural to protect the ones you love, right?
 Even I know that."

Someone's ally.
Ilya easily tells me the motive to be on someone's side.


...I know what's right and what's wrong.
What I've protected until now, and what I want to protect right now.
I know which choice is correct, and which is wrong.
With that in mind, I
I open the door.
Tohsaka is already here, standing in the corner of the chapel.
She's not sitting down but standing there, and I can see her determination.
She has the cold face of a magus, saying Sakura will be her enemy if the crest worm isn't removed.

"......"
Tohsaka doesn't look at me, and I have nothing to say to her either.
The sound of rain echoes inside the chapel.
How long has it been?

"The operation is complete. There is nothing more I can do."
Breaking the deep silence, Kotomine Kirei appears.

"Ehhey, Kirei. What happened to your Magic Crest?"
"Hm, you can tell? As you can see, I used all of it on Matou Sakura's treatment."
"Y-You used it all?"
Tohsaka is astonished.

"......?"
I don't get it.
All I can tell is that something happened to Kotomine's Magic Crest, and Tohsaka is surprised about it.

"D-Do you understand? We're talking about a Magic Crest here!
 Why does something you built up for generations go away in just a few hours...!?"

"It could not be helped. The Crest I received from my father is not permanent, like the one you have. It is a consumption type that goes away the more I use it. We have never been a family of magi to begin with.
 You can think of it as a lower-rank Command Spell."

"Then you really..."
"Yes. I've used up all of it for the treatment. It was the extraction of an eleven-year old pus. It should not be surprising that it took all of my remaining Crest."


...We both gasp.
The priest is saying he used all of his Magic Crest to treat Sakura.
Tohsaka's expression tells me how valuable the compensation was.
Kotomine threw away all of his fortune for Sakura.

"...Kotomine."
"What? Do not tell me it's troubling for you. You two are the ones who told me to save her. I merely answered your wish."

"Oh... no. It's not troubling at all. ...Um, thank you."
"Do not thank me. You will take it back later anyway."
"Take it back later...?"
Does that mean

"So, how's Sakura? You did that much, so"

"She escaped death, but it is just temporary.
 I was able to remove most of the crest worm, but some parts were buried too deeply to be removed. Some of it has eaten into the nerves. I can extract it all if I remove her heart, but that will kill Sakura as well."

"All I could do was to remove the crest worm that did not metabolize with her nerves, decreasing her pain and the pressure from Zouken. Her life should have ended tonight, but I prolonged it on a whim. Well, it will all be vain effort if the worm in her nerves start moving again."

"Whathen Sakura is..."
"It means nothing has changed.
 She will have no problem living normally, but Zouken can easily drive her berserk.
 That old man can force her to fight, whether she wants to or not. In short, she is a bomb with a lit fuse."


I'd be lying if I said I'm not agitated.
But I'm not surprised or puzzled.
I've made my decision already.
I chose to be on Sakura's side, no matter what happens, no matter what state she's in.

"I see. Then there's only one thing left to do. I'm sorry for making you use you Crest."

Tohsaka starts to walk.
I instantly understand what she's going to do.
"Hey, stop, Tohsaka...!"
I grab Tohsaka's hand and stop her.

"What? Talk to me later."
"What are you saying? Are you planning to kill Sakura?"
"Hey, it's something that has to be done. Didn't you come here, prepared for that?"

I know what's right.
The thing that keeps me alive.
I can't turn my back on the thing that has kept me alive.

"I'm sorry, Ilya. I can't follow such an obvious thing."
I turn my mind into steel.
That's it.
The gastric juice coming up my throat, the pain in my stomach, and the tears in eyes. Everything stops.

I can't let my conviction waver.
For the sake of everyone who could not be saved, I can't let any more people share in their fate.

"...I see. So you're choosing the same method as Kiritsugu. You're going to cast away the person you love most for people you don't even know about."


The man who turned away from the Einzberns for something he believed was right.
I've chosen the same path.
Ilya has been betrayed twice now.
Not choosing Sakura also means not choosing Ilya.

"That's right. Kiritsugu and I are the same. If you want to curse someone, you can curse me."
My mind has turned into hard steel.
Getting scorned or cursed is not heavy for me at all.

The silver-haired girl doesn't say anything.
I have denied her wish, so now would be the time to take her revenge on Kiritsugu.
But...

"I pity you, Shirou.
 You're going to be deceiving yourself forever with that crying face of yours."

Ilya tells me goodbye with a fading smile.

It starts to rain.
There's no one in the park.
It should be over at the church by now.

I open the door.
Tohsaka is already here, standing in the corner of the chapel.
She's not sitting down but standing there, and I can see her determination.
She has the cold face of a magus, saying Sakura will be her enemy if the crest worm isn't removed.

"......"
Tohsaka doesn't look at me, and I have nothing to say to her either.
The sound of rain echoes inside the chapel.
How long was it?

"The operation is complete. There is nothing more I can do."
Breaking the deep silence, Kotomine Kirei appears.

"........So, how's Sakura, Kirei?"
"I have done my best. That is all I can say."
The result is as expected.
There was never a chance that Sakura could be saved.

"Matou Sakura is sleeping. She should wake up tomorrow morning.
 What will you do as the successor of the Tohsaka family, Rin?"
"I don't even need to say it. It's the supervisor's duty to eliminate a magus who has turned into a heretic. All the more so if the magus is a relative of mine."

The back of the chapel.
Tohsaka walks on, probably heading to the room Sakura's sleeping in.

"Aren't you going to stop me, Emiya-kun?"
Tohsaka turns back to me at the door.
I reply with silence.

"So you won't mind even if I kill Sakura?"
"I have nothing to say. Butif I can take your place, I will."
"No. This is my role. I can't give you this role."

Tohsaka opens the door and disappears inside.
"I'm surprised. I thought you would stop her."

"...Hm. It seems you are determined.
 The Holy Grail War will now return to normal. This is a bit disappointing, but I am looking forward to the end."

"...What's there to look forward to? Are you predicting who will win?"
"Predict? There is no need to predict.
 You will win.
 Since you have cast away Matou Sakura, you will use any means possible to kill Matou Zouken, Ilyasviel, and Rin. I am saying I am looking forward to how this will end."

"...Why? I won't fight Tohsaka. There's no reason for me to stop her, even if she's going to obtain the Holy Grail."

"You will fight her. You will be forced to fight her when you find out about the true identity of the Holy Grail. Having killed Matou Sakura, Rin will go mad unless she obtains the Holy Grail.
 She will try to win for her belief, and you will try to destroy the Holy Grail for your ideal.
 You two are incompatible with each other now. You two shall act out the final stage of the Holy Grail War."

The priest leaves the chapel as well.
...The room Sakura and Tohsaka are in.
He knows what happened there is already over.

"Are you saying I will remain until the very end?"
"Of course. You are Emiya Kiritsugu now. There is no way you cannot win."

...The priest has left.
The only one in the chapel is Emiya Shirou, with a mind of steel.


The priest's words are true.
I will continue fighting, defeat Zouken, Ilya, and Tohsaka, and destroy the Holy Grail.

That is the end of this war.
That is the responsibility I took when I swore to be a superhero.
It is the first price I have to pay to become my ideal.

There's no need to talk about the obvious outcome.
Emiya Shirou will turn his mind to steel, and become a superhero.
Morning.
When the bright sunlight wakes me, I realize my neck is stiff.

"Mmwhoa......"
My neck feels heavy because my shoulders are stiff.
I probably strained my neck when I slept on my stomach.

On the other hand, my back feels much better now.
I don't feel any pain, so it shouldn't hinder my normal life.
"Crap. It's past seven."

"Ouch!"
I feel a sharp pain in my stomach.
It's fine as long as I stay still, but it hurts when I suddenly move.

"It's a bruise, so I bet it'll hurt for a while."
But it's nothing I can't endure.
It's not like it's bad enough to stop me from moving, so I should be able to act normally.

I get changed and leave my room.
I smell breakfast from the living room, so I bet Sakura's preparing it.

"Morning. I'm sorry I slept in. Is there anything I can still help with?"
"Good morning, Senpai. It's rare for you to sleep in."
"Ugh, I'm sorry. Um, it was already morning when I noticed."

"It can't be helped because you're injured. I went to wake you up earlier, but you didn't even show signs of waking up. I think your body's tired."

Wow.
I have no memory of Sakura coming to wake me up.
Not only are my shoulders stiff, but it seems my head is still asleep.

"I'm sorry. I'm gonna go wash my face. I'll be back right away."
"No, please take your time. I'll prepare breakfast by myself today, so please go wash your face."
Sakura is really energetic.

"......?"
Well, if she's making the offer, I shouldn't turn her down.
"Then I'll go ahead and go wash my face."

"Yes. I'm confident in today's miso soup, so please look forward to it."
I nod and head into the hallway.

"Wait."
Something's strange.
I went past her without caring because she was energetic, but this is just like

"......!"
I hear something falling to the ground.
I don't know if it's because I've heard it many times these past few days, but I realize it's the sound of someone falling.

"Sakura!"
I run back into the living room.
...Sakura must have been on the ground, as she slowly raises her upper body.

"Sakura."
I support her staggering body.

"......!"
Her body is hot, just like before.
Her breathing is ragged and her shirt is wet with her sweat, telling me how bad her condition is.

"OhSenpai."
She must have come to her senses.
Sakura looks at me with unfocused eyes.

"Geez. I told you to take your time, but you came back right away. ...Um, please hold on. I'll prepare breakfast right away."
She smiles and brushes my hand off of her.

"Sakura."
It doesn't seem like she's pushing herself, but rather that she doesn't notice she's sick.

"Hold on. You don't have to make breakfast. Just go back to your room and lie down. You have a high fever."
"Huh...? I have a fever?"

"Yes. ...Damn, it's really bad if you don't know it yourself! Why"
Why didn't I notice something so obvious?
Even though I was depressed about Saber, there's something wrong with me if I can't care for Sakura's health.

"Um, Senpai...? I'm really fine. I just fell, so it's not like I'm dizzy or anything..."

"Don't say stupid things! You have such a high fever! I don't even need a thermometer to tell that!"

"Oh"

I pull her into the living room.
I have to let Sakura rest for now.
I'll report to the school that she's going to be absent, make some breakfast that's easy to digest, and for lunchyeah, I'll ask Fujimura's old man and have one of their housekeepers come over.

"U-Um... where are you going, Senpai? We have to eat breakfast before we go to school."

Sakura still hasn't grasped the situation.
All her energy must have been a result of the fever.

"You're not going to school. You're resting in your room today. I'll let the school know. I'm going to see Fuji-Nee in class, so I'll tell her then."

"EhI'm not going to school?"
"Right. Who else would it be? I'm... well, I'm injured, but I'll be fine. There's no reason for me to stay home."


...Well, there's no reason for me to push myself and go to school. Because I lost Saber, I don't have such liberty.
But there's something I have to do.
I can't be staying in my house until I go tell Tohsaka about last nightabout Matou Zouken and Assassin.

"Anyway, you're to stay home today. You're working hard every day, so you can rest once in a while. I'll come home right away after I'm done with my business."

"Ohno, I'm really fine...!
 So let's eat breakfast and go to school. This fever will go away if I do...!"
"Such a thing won't happen, you idiot. You're being absurd, Sakura."

"I-I'm not being absurd!
 You're the one being reckless. I'm feeling perfectly fine, and you're injured! But I'm the only one staying home? That's"
"Eh... Whoa, Sakura!"

"Huh? That's strange, Senpai. I'm... having trouble... breathing"
Sakura's breathing hard and is about to fall to the ground.

...I support her, but her body is heavy.
She must not have the power to stand up, or maybe she can't stand up because her body is heavy.
Either way, Sakura's so sick that she can't walk by herself, and she's the only one who thinks she's fine.

"...You idiot. Look, I'm going to make you stay home today no matter what. I don't care if you don't like it or not, but you'll end up staying home tomorrow too if you use up extra energy."

"......But, Senpai. I... have to... go to school."
Delirious, Sakura punctuates her sentence with ragged breaths.

Ignoring her, I lift her up and head to the guest room.

She's already asleep when I get there.
But she must still be semi-conscious.
She's breathing painfully and takes a firm grip on my arm.


I lay her on the bed.
"Oh... Senpai...?"
Her voice is vague.
Sakura is staring at the ceiling, not at me.

"Sakura."
Her ragged breathing, flushed cheeks, sweat-dampened clothes, and heaving breasts...

"!"
She looks so erotic that I quickly look away.
Why am I so imprudent when Sakura's sick!?

"...Crap. I guess I'll have to ask their housekeeper."
...I can't change her clothes or wipe her down.

Her breathing has calmed down since she is lying down, so she should get better with some fever medicine.
Once she can walk again, I can take her to the hospital to go get some medicine.

"Sakura. I'm going to go get someone, so sleep until then. You're familiar with Fuji-Nee's housekeeper, right?"

There's no reply.
Her breathing still sounds painful, but it seems she's asleep.

"Phew. You're obstinate in weird ways, Sakura. Why do you want to go to school so bad?"
I'm just talking to myself.
I know there won't be a reply because Sakura's asleep.

"Bye. I'm going to school."
I step away from the bed and head to the door.
Then.
"...I want to go to school with you, Senpai."
I hear her answer.

"Sakura...?"
I turn around.
Sakura is still asleep, and her eyes are closed painfully.
"...Oh, she's just talking in her sleep."

I leave the guest room.
On my way out...

"......Because I have to protect Senpai."

She says this in feverish tones.

I drop by Fuji-Nee's place on my way to school to have their housekeeper come by.
I sometimes forget because Fuji-Nee's not the type to dress up, but the Fujimura family is one of the richest households around here.

It has dozens of scary-looking people that call themselves company employees even though it's not even a company.
Many of them live in the outbuilding, so they are a large family.
So there are many housekeepers, and one will be free to spare if I ask.

So.
I get one of the emergency housekeepers, who took care of my place a few times before Sakura started coming over.
She's acquainted with Sakura, so I can trust her to take care of her.

I wait for Tohsaka by the front gate.
The sky is gray, and it looks like it'll rain any minute now.
There's a chill wind, so it'll be a cold night if it rains.

"What are you thinking about?"
Then.
Tohsaka is in front of me when I notice.
She must have ran here, as her shoulders are moving up and down.

"Nothing. I just thought it might rain."
"Oh, the weather? I guess it'll just be a drizzle. We have to go patrol at night, so it'll be a pain if it rains too much."

...Hm.
It seems Tohsaka has already made plans for us to go on patrol tonight.
I don't mind, but I'd like to go by my house and check on Sakura before that.

"Tohsaka, about that..."
"I know. I'll train you as your cooperator, so prepare yourself. I'll make you a proper magus."

With those confident words, Tohsaka sets off down the hill.
...Crap.
I can't bring up the subject of going home early if she smiles like that.

We make the long walk up the hill south of the intersection.
This residential area is filled with Western-style houses.
Tohsaka's house is at the top of this hill, past Sakura's.

"Wow"
So this is Tohsaka's place.
Sakura's house is bigger, but this house feels more like a Western mansion.

...And it somehow feels cold.
There's been an air that seems to reject anyone nearing this place ever since we finished climbing up the hill.

"Why did you stop? This is my house."
"YYeah, I know. I was just coerced."

"...Yeah. My house is different from yours. It's just that even someone who's ignorant of magical energy like you can feel the coldness of this house."
Tohsaka goes into her home, speaking in bored tones.

"Hey, come on. I don't have any traps set up, so you don't need to hesitate."
She beckons me from the entrance.

"......No. It's not because of the atmosphere that I'm hesitating."
Muttering to myself, I gather my composure and go in.

...This place certainly does have a cold atmosphere, but that's nothing.
She has no idea what a big deal it is for a guy to come over to Tohsaka Rin's house.
...Well, I'm sure she won't understand even if I explain it to her. If I'm lucky, she'll just laugh.

Wait.

"W-Why are we in your room and not the living room!"

With an utter lack of concern, she shows me through the living room and into her bedroom.

"It's because this place has more instruments ready.
 The living room is where you have tea, but we didn't come here to drink tea, right?"
"Uhum. You're... right, but..."
Um, I wish she'd think of me as a boy her age.

"...? Just sit down wherever. I'll be using sage and cards to consecrate you, but tell me now if you don't like either."

Tohsaka opens the box by her bed.
It looks like a treasure chest from an adventure movie.

"Hmm... Kishua's agate is useless for this. ...Oh, I'm out of sage. Can you bring some up from downstairs, Archer?"
"Scarlet sage, right? ...Well, I don't think you'll need to go that far to distinguish this man."

"I'll do whatever I please. You can rest downstairs after that. We have a pact, so you don't need to protect me."
"You're right. I doubt he has the nerve to betray you. I shall get ready for tonight."

That must be Archer.
His presence must be thin when in spirit form. I didn't feel much magical energy from him.

"...I'm surprised. I didn't notice that he was in the room."
"That's how it is if he's in spirit form.
 Even if he takes form, his magical energy won't leak outside as long as he's in this house. It's elementary for a workshop to shut in the magical energy."

"Oh. So is it the same for Makiri... no, Matou's place?"
"Yes. But that place has no need to hide magical energy anymore. If they are hiding magical energy, it'd be the energy leaking out from the magus himself and not from the house."

"Well, either way, it takes nothing to hide magical energy. I'd take Archer with me to school too, but I'm resting him during the day since he's not up to par."

Tohsaka rummages through the treasure chest with a difficult expression.
...It seems she can't find what she wants. Is she the kind of person that never keeps anything in order?

"...Really, why doesn't the wound he received from Saber heal when all other wounds can be healed easily? I'm sure they had some connection... Geez, why am I finding my master's jewels now? I can never find them when I want them, dammit!"

She leans forward and keeps fumbling around.
...That chest looks small, but it seems big enough to be able to fit Tohsaka inside.

"Man."
There's nothing to prepare for.
All I can do is pray that she'll find the thing she wants, or just look around her room aimlessly

"......?"
Then.
I see something.

It's a photo.
A bookshelf that's about waist-high is at the corner of the room.
On it is a photo that looks to have been forgotten.
Dust falls off of it when I pick it up, and I can tell it has been left alone for a long time

"...It's not that she never cleans. Just this picture is undisturbed."
Does Tohsaka not like seeing herself as a kid?
...No, if that were all, she could just put it away. Maybe it's important to her, but she doesn't want to touch it...

"......But..."
People sure can change.
Tohsaka looks like she's five or six years old, and she's really cute in the picture.

"...So she had long hair back then, too.... Huh?"
The girl in the picture looks just like she is now, except younger.
That's why I notice the one thing that's different.

"Thanks for waiting, I'm all ready now. There'll be a little pain, but it's nothing you should be worried about... Huh, what's going on, Emiya-kun?"

"Oh. This, Tohsaka."
I show her the picture I found.

"Oh, that's an old photo. I just put that in the corner, but is something wrong with it?"
"Huh... Well, there's nothing wrong, but..."

It's nothing much, so I hesitate.
It's nothing I need to ask about, but it just caught my attention.

"Oh. I see, you want to say I have a different ribbon on, right?"

I nod.

"That's natural. I'm a girl, so I have lots of ribbons. Even if it's my favorite, do you think I'd keep the same ribbon for over ten years?"

Oh.
She's right now that she mentions it.
It's just an ordinary ribbon.  Why was I so concerned about it?

"I'm kidding. That's what I want to say, but ribbons are special. It's the last resort for female magi. It's an appropriate magical item, so there aren't many substitutes for it."
"...Wow. Then is that ribbon some sort of a magical item?"

"Yes. Holding the hair in place means holding the magical energy in place. My family doesn't have mystic eyes, so we have to at least keep our reserve magical energy from our hair.
 It's something that controls your body, so it's best if you make it yourself, right?"

"That's the first ribbon I made. It was my favorite, but I parted with it for various reasons.
 ...Well, let's stop with the idle talk. I'm starting the consecration, so sit down in that chair"
"I'm not prepared for such a thing. I came back for Sakura.
 If you're going to kill her, then I'll stop you."
"!"

"Then what are you going to do...!?
 Look, Sakura can't live unless she fights as a Master.
 She has to absorb other people's magical energy to survive...!
 Don't you see how this will end!?  Killing her here is for her own good...!"

"...No way! Why are you jumping to conclusions when she hasn't done anything yet!"

"How could I not? If this were just about Sakura, there'd be hope. But it's not, is it? That damn old man holds her life, and she's his puppet as long as he lives.
 Do you think he's ever going to let her go?"
"That's..."

"See, you understand. Zouken will never give her a moment's peace. ...Then... If she's going to go through endless torment with no hope of escape, all we can do is kill her here and minimize the number of victims. Sakura and all the people Sakura will kill would be saved."

"Unlike you, I can't endanger everyone while clinging to a forlorn hope. The weakness to delay your decision is going to hurt her even more."


Tohsaka's right.
It's not that death itself is salvation, but if our goal is to save people, her solution is the best.
Any other idea would just be a selfish mistake.

Ten people will die if we don't do anything.
But if we can save nine by sacrificing one, then
That's...
The reality I have always tried to deny, but have known deep within my heart to be true.

"No. You're mistaken."
"Emiya... kun?"
"I won't let there be any victims.
 You're the weak one, jumping to conclusions before even trying."

"D-Don't kid me...! Do you know what that means!? Save Sakura? What does that mean!? Are you going to save both her and the people she's going to kill!? Don't make me laugh! You can't do such a thing alone...!"

"No, I can't. But I'm going to protect Sakura. I'll think about what the result may be starting now."

"! I see, then you're my enemy.
 ...Let go of me. Or you're going to be blown away."
"Go ahead. But Tohsaka, don't think everything will go your way."

...Our hands tighten on each other.
Mine is from tension.
Tohsaka's iswell, I want to believe hers is because of tension too.
It's give-and-take, but we can't back down because we both have things we believe in and

"What the...!?"
"What...!?"
Outside the chapel.
We hear the sound from the next room and exchange looks.

"Did you hear that, Emiya-kun...?"
"A window broke. And after that..."

"Running footsteps. The only ways out of here are through this chapel or the back door. What is she doing, breaking the window to go outside?
 ...Oh, I see. Most windows here have fixed fittings.
 She had to break it to get out. For someone who's still recovering, she's pretty violent."

"Recoveringdo you mean Sakura!?"
"Who else? From the room she was in, you can somehow hear everything said in the chapel. I am sure she fled when she heard you discuss killing her."

"Wha-"
"Forgive me. It is a structural defect."
"Don't lie, you fake priest...! I'm sure it's intentional!"

Tohsaka shakes off my hand and starts running.
She runs not to the room, but to the door leading outside.

"Tohsaka!"
"We'll talk later! Finding Sakura comes first! Geez, where is she going to go in her condition...!?"
She quickly opens the door and runs outside.
Tohsaka goes into the rain without an umbrella.

"!"
I don't have any time to lose either.
I don't know where Sakura went, but she can't be left by herself now!

"Wait.  I do not mind if you plan to search for Matou Sakura, but there is something I forgot to tell you."
"What? I don't have time for one of your long speeches...!"
"Do not say that. This is important. I will be troubled if I do not tell you. Rin ran off without listening to me, so I need to tell somebody. Do I not?"

"...Is this about Sakura?"
"Yes. She does not have long to live.
 The crest worm continues to corrupt her body as we speak.
 It is easy to extract it, but her body would never withstand the shock. It's like pulling out four-tenths of her nerves. She would die as a human being before the pain caused her to die of shock."

"But leaving her alone will lead to the same result.
 The loss of magical energy is slowly eroding her sanity. Soon she will lose all sense of self. Once that happens, she will be nothing more than a rampaging Master.
 She will sacrifice many people to maintain her Servant, and when the strain becomes too much to bear, she will self-destruct.
 In short, you cannot save that woman, no matter what you do."


I feel dizzy, as though I'm looking into a strobe lamp.

"Broken things do not repair themselves, and lost things never return. If you wanted to save her, you should have done so eleven years ago.
 Do you still intend to save her, Emiya Shirou?
 She will die in the next few days no matter what we do. Is there a meaning in saving such a person?"


I can't breathe.
I can barely stand under the impact of his words.

"...I don't know anything about that. But you saved Sakura. Isn't that reason enough?"
"Well. I only treated her out of duty. I cannot turn away someone who came seeking help."

"Don't lie. You wouldn't use up your Magic Crest just out of duty. I don't know why, but you wanted to save Sakura.
 You didn't want to let her die. I feel the same way too."
I glare at the priest.
...He must understand, because he nods slightly.

"Yes. Then hurry. Rin will surely kill Matou Sakura if she finds her first. Provide that lost child with shelter before that happens."
He doesn't need to tell me.
Turning my back to him, I follow Tohsaka into the rain.

My breath is white.
Under the cold winter rain, my breath seems to freeze and blow back against my face.

"Sakura."
There's no one on the road.
The street lamps light up the night in vain, and I run without aim.
...I'm going to find Sakura.
It's not just the premonition that something terrible is going to happen if I don't find her quickly.
I just want to hold her hand right now and feel her warmth.

"HaaHaa, ha"
I run blindly.
I don't know where she went.
...Sakura no longer has any place to go.
There's no place for her at my house nor at the Matou household. She has to be wandering in the night.

"...She shouldn't have gone far.  If you needed to find shelter where there weren't any people"
It's a wild guess.
But the only thing I can do right now is to check every one of the possibilities

"Ha, haa, haah."
I cross the bridge.
Sakura wasn't around the Shinto station, and I didn't hear anything about a girl like Sakura being there.

Even though it's night, it's not so late that places will be deserted.
There weren't many, but I saw a few people walking about.
But if none of them saw Sakura, maybe she avoided Shinto and went back to Miyama City.

She's probably still in her school uniform, so she would stand out in this rain.
If she wanted to avoid attention, she would head to Miyama Cityand that's what I'm thinking as I run through the rain, when...

"Sakura."
I come to a stop.
Under the bridge.
Sakura is standing alone on the dark, desolate, brick road.

I go down to the park.
...Does she notice me?
Sakura is looking down while exposing her body to the rain.

...I can't think of anything to say to her.
All I can do is take her home.

"Sakura."
I call out to her as I approach.
"No, please don't come...!"
And...
Sakura refuses with desperateness I've never seen before.


I stop.
Sakura is still looking down, tightly clutching her skirt in her hands.
She looks like a criminal mortified by her actions.  It's heart-breaking.
...I can't go any closer.
I feel that I shouldn't until she raises her head.

"Sakura."
"...Please go home.
 If you come near me right nowI don't know what I'll do."

Her voice is shaking.
She's trembling because of the cold rain and her feelings of guilt.
...I can't erase them from her.
All I can do is...
"Let's go home. You haven't recovered from your cold yet, right?"
...Extend my hands.

"...Senpai."
Sakura's wet hair sways.
Sakura bites her lips.
"I can't go. Where can I go back to now?"
Her voice is heavy with self-loathing.

"Sakura."
"It's fine, Senpai. You don't need to force yourself to care for me."

"...Because you know already, right? You heard what I am. You heard what's going on with my body, didn't you? Thenthis is..."
...All over.
Her white breath tells me the end of her sentence.

"Don't say such a stupid thing. What I heard is unimportant. The only Sakura I know is the one I've been with.
 So why does it have to end because of something like this?"

"...Because it will end.
 I'm not a virgin, Senpai. I was raped at the place I was adopted as a kid, and my first time was a long time ago. Not only that, my body has been continuously violated by unknown things."

Sakura's nails dig into her elbow.
...It's a masochistic action as if punishing the dirty stains on her body.


"That's not the only thing. I'm a magus of the Matou family, and I've been hiding that fact from you.
 ...I didn't tell you when I became a Master, and I pretended not to know anything when you brought Saber-san over.
 Don't you see? It would've been so much more convenient.  And you wouldn't get mad at me that way, right?"

"Sakura."

"But I'm really stupid. I shouldn't be able to deceive you, but I thought I could.
 I thought it's fine even if my grandfather's worm is in me. I thought I wouldn't lose if I held myself firm, but I easily lost.
 ...The stuff that was splashed on me was just aphrodisiac. It's not poison or anything, but it makes my body more sensitive. That's all it took to make me go crazy and hurt you."

"...Tohsaka-Senpai is right. I'm a coward, I'm a crybaby, I'm selfish... I knew this was going to happen, but I couldn't disobey my grandfather or end it myself.
 I didn't want to be hurt or scared, and I value myself more than others, so I couldn't find the courage to kill myself...!"

...She's crying.
Sakura is crying.
She's crying and doesn't know what to do, which just makes her cry even harder.


Feeling her pain, I regret what I've done.
I have never seen her cry before.
The reason behind those tears...
Why didn't I realize sooner that she can only cry when condemning herself?

"Don't crySakura."

"You seeeverything is my fault.
 I'm just a puppet for my grandfather, and I could go crazy any minute now. Sooner or later I'll do something terrible. So where can such a person go, Senpai...!?"

Sakura corners herself.
...Nobody is condemning her.
That's why she has to do so herself.
She has to say she's the evil one. She has to condemn herself and punish herself.

"So, don't cry."

...Sakura once said it.
That she's a coward who needs someone to lead her by force.
I finally understand what she meant.

Someone I want to protect.
Someone important to me.
Someone I never thought I would lose.
If I don't want her to cry anymore...
I have to take her hand and lead her to a place in the sun, so I should now

"...I'm sorry, Senpai. I've been deceiving you all this time.
 I never really believed I deserved to be with you. Every day I thought about ending it all... just acting like a stranger from that day on.
 I'd just pass by you in the hallway, ignore you after school, go home alone at night, and forget everything that happened...!"

Oh.
If she'd done that, I would've gone crazy.
I'm sorry I didn't realize that.

"But I couldn't...! My body would tremble at the pure thought of it, and it was really frightening. It was scarier than the time I put a knife on my wrist, and I couldn't stop myself from going to your house. I was scared of deceiving you, scared to stop deceiving you, and everything around me was scary. I couldn't move at all, and I didn't know what to do...!"

But I believe this is for the best.
Sakura says I should never have learned about this.
But if that were the case, she would just have kept on crying.

"...I'm stupid, right? You would've eventually found out. But it's too late now, and I can never go back to your house. I thought every night that I should get away from you before it happened.
 It's for your own good, and I knew I would stop crying at night, but"

I can't let her cry anymore.
If Sakura has to blame herself because nobody will blame her...

"ButBut I still wanted to hide it from you...!
 I wanted to protect my time with you...!
 That was the only meaningful thing for me, so why...!"

Even if nobody would forgive her, I would keep forgiving her in her place.

"Oh"
I embrace her cold body.

...My arms are terribly unreliable.
I can't hold her tightly, nor can I pull her close.
...I can't save Sakura.
I want her to be with me, and I can only stay by her side.

...Awkwardly, I wrap my arms around her.
Even if this is all I can do right now, my determination is definite and firm.

"Senpai, I"
"Don't cry. I understand you're a bad person now."


She gasps.
Sakura is confused, torn between guilt and regret.
To deny those feelings, I tell her what I truly feel.

"So I'll protect you. No matter what happens, even if you try to kill yourselfI'll protect you, Sakura."
"Sen... pai."
"I promise. I'll be your superhero."

...I hold her a bit tighter.
Even if it's just a touch, I do so to tell her that my oath is more firm than anything.

"......"
How much effect did it have?
The stubbornness flows out of Sakura, and her shoulders relax.

...No matter what she says, Sakura is still the same.
Her sensation and her warmth are the same.
Our breaths are white, and the pouring rain has turned to a drizzle.

In the freezing night...
"No, SenpaiI'll probably end up hurting you."
Her words sound like a confession.


The rain is stopping.
The night is cold as midwinter, and Sakura doesn't try to free herself from my arms.
...And...
"I'm going to hurt you, Senpai, but"

I want to stay like this.
A tear trickles down her cheek as she says it.

And with that, the choice is made.
Something decisive has ended.

I don't know if this is love or not.
Buta premonition lingers in the back of my mind...
Telling me that the end of this love will not be compensation.
The rain has completely stopped by the time we return to my house.
...We've been holding hands ever since we left the park.
We calmed down as we walked, and by the time we got to the hill, we were actually embarrassed, but in the end we didn't let go even for a moment.

"Huh......? The light at the door is on. Did you come back here, Sakura?"
"...Um, I don't think it's me. It might be Fujimura-Sensei."

"Oh yeah."
We go to the door, hand in hand.
Her cold hand has become warm.
I'm relieved to feel the warmth of her life, and I enter my house as if I've just come home from school.

"Welcome home. I know it was rude, but I came in without your permission."

"T-Tohsaka"
"Nee...... Tohsaka-Senpai."

"Yes. I guessed you would come back here eventually, but I didn't think it was going to be both of you. ...Well, I thought it might be possible in your case."

"!"
I quickly push Sakura behind me and confront Tohsaka.

"Tohsaka, you still...!"
"Of course. I can't leave Matou Sakura alone as a magus of Tohsaka. The Association will be after me if I don't punish her as the supervisor of Fuyuki. It'll be too late then."

"I don't care about your circumstances. Sakura hasn't done anything yet. If you still want to do something to her, you'll have to silence me first."
"You're right. You're a free magus that doesn't belong to the Association, so it might be good to discipline you here.
 I'm going to kill Sakura. I'll kill you too if you get in my way."

"......"
My senses become alert.
...Tohsaka's fingertip.
Once it moves, that'll signal the start of the battle.

I'll escape outside with Sakura before Tohsaka can finish her spell.
After thatI'll decide what to do after that on the spot.
For now, I'm going to concentrate on getting away from here.
The difference in our skills.
I can't even spare to think about what I might do against Archer, who should be here.


Tohsaka's lips start to move.
When I notice she's merely speaking, not casting a spell...
"Stop, please stop, Nee-san...!"
...Sakura jumps in between us.

"Sakura."
"S-Senpai's right. So far, he's the only one I've hurt. So if he's forgiven me, I shouldn't be punished yet."

"Hey now. Do you really understand the state your body is in?
 How can you say that?"
"...I can say it. I'm still fine.
 Are you serious, Tohsaka-Senpai? Senpai isn't a Master anymore. Saber-san's gone, and he's just my Senpai now, but you're saying you're going to kill him?

"Of course. It doesn't matter whether or not he's armed.  If he's planning to get in my way, I'll have to dispose of him."

"Then. If you're still going to fight Senpai, I'm going to fight you. I won't lose to you as Rider's Master."
Sakura is trembling, but she confronts Tohsaka with the utmost courage.


...Is she surprised by Sakura's determination, or does she think it's disadvantageous to fight here?
"I see. If you can say something like that, then fight on and win the war as a Master. Come to think of it, there is one way that you could be saved.
 You would easily be able to disenchant Zouken's bindings if you obtained the Holy Grail."

"Oh... Tohsaka-Senpai."
"It's not that I'm letting you go.
 ...We'll have our chance to fight as Masters. I'm just saying this isn't the appropriate place."

She passes by us.
To my surprise, she doesn't show any enmity as she passes by.

"Tohsaka."
"......Hmph. So our alliance only lasted a day, huh? We can't cooperate as long as you're protecting Sakura."


"But don't forget. We don't know when Sakura might run wild.
 It's your own fault if you die when that happens, but since you took her in, you'd better make sure you're the only victim."
She leaves without turning around.

"...Senpai. Um, I..."
"Don't look so worried, you idiot. That's her way of being ironic. It's her hobby to make fun of people."
"......"

I do my best to cheer Sakura up as we go into the hallway.
We're both freezing, so we should quickly get changed and warm ourselves up.

'...Since you took her in, you'd better make sure you're the only victim.'

That means that when she kills me, I have to kill her as well.
Tohsaka left, leaving me with what I must do at the very least.

...That will never happen.
I keep convincing myself as we head to the living room.

...Our clasped hands are really warm.
Sakura is here, alive.
That's all I care about now.
I can't make Sakura uneasy by worrying about other things, but...

"...Hm?"
Wait.
I think Sakura's hand is too warm.

"Sakura. Did your cold get worse again?"
"Huh...? U-Um, how is it? Do I feel hot?"
She must not know herself, as she asks me a strange question.

"No, it's not terribly hot, but you're warmer than me. It feels warm when I touch you."
"Ohi-it's probably a cold...! I think I caught a cold because I was in the rain for so long."
...?
I don't know why, but Sakura lowers her head in embarrassment.

"I see, you're right. Then you have to hurry and get changed and warm your body up. I'll cook dinner, so you go check your temperature, and if it's high, you're to come back to the living room wearing something warm. I'll make sure to cook something that's easy to eat."

"Oh... N-No, I don't need dinner. Um, I'm going to bed, so you can rest as well...!"
Sakura leaves in a hurry.

"...?"
Oh well.
I'll catch a cold too if I stand here like this, so I should take a bath and warm myself up.
I finish taking the bath and return to my room.
Now that I've changed out of my wet clothes, I finally feel like I'm home again.

"Phew."
I sit down and let out a sigh while relaxing my shoulders.
...Today was a long day.
Many things happened, and there were many ups and downs.
I sort out the things I've lost from those I still have.

"...Right. Sakura is Rider's Master."
It seems Sakura had given her right to Shinji, but she is Rider's Master now.
Then Rider must be nearby, protecting Sakura.

"...Yeah. I've seen Rider a few times already.
 If she'll be protecting Sakura, I have to go introduce myself to her properly."

...She's unapproachable because of her appearance, but I think she's understanding.
I don't know when Sakura will be attacked by Zouken, so Rider is the only one I can rely on.

...Well, according to Kotomine, Sakura's condition will get worse the more she uses her Servant, so relying on Rider is a last resort.

"All right. I'll have Sakura introduce me to her tomorrow.
 Oh... but she might hold a grudge after losing to Saber."
My shoulders slump.
...But Rider will be living here too, so I should at least greet her

"Who is it!?"
"......!"
I raise myself so that I can jump back instantly and glare at the shouji.
...Outside the room.
...I can see the silhouette of someone standing on the porch.


...There's no reply.
The figure seems to be waiting for my reaction.


...Damn.
There's nothing I can use as a weapon here. I guess I'll have to attack first before

"S-Senpai. Um, are you awake...?"
"Huh...? Oh, it's you, Sakura."
I sit back down.
...Man.
She should've said something. What's wrong with her?

"What's up? You can use the bath whenever you like. If you need a change, there's Fuji-Nee's clothes, right?"
"...Yes. I've already taken a bath and borrowed Fujimura-Sensei's clothes."

"...?"
Now I'm really confused.
I don't think there's anything else to ask.

"Um... Senpai. Can I come in?"
"Yeah. Why are you being so formal?"
The shouji opens.
And the person entering the room is...


Sakura, in normal clothes, acting strangely.


I hear someone gulp.
I realize that it's me and feel myself heating up.
"Uhum..."
I cover my mouth with my hand and look away.


...This is bad.
I looked away, but the urge to look at her is overwhelming.
My heart's beating rapidly, and my head is so confused that it might run away unless I keep the reins on.


In short, I'm about to go crazy.
I don't know why, but Sakura is unnaturally beautiful right now.

"......"
Sakura just stands there.
I finally realize that something else is strange.

"...Sakura? You're acting weird. How's your fever? Do you have a cold after all?"
"...No. I do have a fever, but it's not because of a cold.
 It's not because I'm sick that I'm burning up."
Sakura looks down awkwardly.

"!"
The gesture almost makes me let go of the reins.

...Sakura acted like this from time to time over the last couple of days.
I thought I'd grown used to noticing parts of her that I didn't know about, and that she's a girl my age.
But... I think this is on a different level entirely.

"...Sakura?"
"...It's no good, Senpai. I can't suppress it by myself any longer."
Sakura blushes and tries to endure the embarrassment.

"WWhat can't you suppress?"
"...It's exactly what you're thinking.
 ...The worm in me is eating my magical energy and telling me it's not enough. ...It wants more. My body started to heat up just by holding your hand and thinking it's warm."


I can hear the heat in her unsteady words.
Sakura is feeling embarrassment and something like joy from exposing her dark side.

"...You know, right, Senpai? I was trained as a magus at the Matou household. ...Grandfather tampered with my body so that he could turn a child of another bloodline into a magus of the Matou family."

"...The result is this lewd body that desires men. ...My body heats up and goes crazy unless I get semen from a magus."


...I get dizzy.
I don't know when I entered another dimension. but the room itself starts to warp and laugh.

But I'm the one who's strange.
I should be angry at Zouken, but I can only stare at Sakura's body.

"...Senpai. Why did you protect someone like me? I'm already impure. Even if I like you, I can't do anything for you.
 So why are you protecting me, going as far as making Tohsaka-SenpaiNee-san your enemy?"

Sakura's voice echoes in my head like a clanging bell.
...The reason I'm protecting Sakura.
I don't even need to think about it.
I don't even need to think about it, so I can tell her even in my current state.

"You're wrong. I didn't protect you. I just wanted to be with you.
 I need you, Sakura, and I couldn't think about being separated from you.
 So I can't give you to Tohsaka, even if she is your older sister."

"Are you saying that as family? 
Or do you see me as a woman?"

There's no way that I can see her as family now.
I've wanted Sakura by my side these past couple of daysno, for a long time. ...It's just that I can't lie to myself any longer.

"Yeah. I love you, Sakura."
I'm still entranced, but I manage to say it.
...I know it's something I shouldn't say, something I shouldn't give in to, but I can't fight against it any longer.

"Then please make love to me.
 Or elseI'll feel so uneasy that I'll go crazy."

"But Sakura..."
My voice of reason mounts one last, desperate defense.
But...
"...Senpai. Am I dirty...?"
Her words destroy every obligation in me.

", Sa..."
My tongue is not working.
Proper thoughts freeze in my brain.
Sakura's bare legs.
I try my best to look away from the spectacle that grabs a hold of my heart.

"Sa... kura"
Is my mind not the only thing frozen?
My eyes keep staring at Sakura, and my body, even the fingertips, doesn't move.

"......Senpai."
Embarrassed, Sakura trembles a bit.
The motion causes a silver droplet to stream down her legs.


The smell makes me dizzy.
I shouldn't be able to smell it, but seeing the light reflected off of it makes me feel her warmth.

"...Please look, Senpai. Please don't look away and watch my lewd body."
"!"
I can't oppose her voice.
...I know I'm disgracing Sakura the more I stare at her, but I can't avert my eyes.

The juices stream down.
Her bare vagina is more than wet enough.
The lewd juice flows out and streams down her legs.
Although she closes her thighs bashfully, she cannot contain the flow which is down to her ankles now.

The moonlight entangles with the trickling juice.
Sakura's love juice does not let go of the light it catches.
The light sparkles in between her legs.

So...
"...It's strange, right? I-It's natural for you to want to look away. ...I've been like this ever since we held hands.
 ...It does this just by being near you, and no matter how much I pleasure myself, it won't settle down. I can't take my mind off you, Senpai, and I..."
How could I ever call her dirty?

"Why? You're not dirty. You're beautiful, Sakura."
"Senpai."
Her voice flushes a bit.
She looked like she was about to collapse, but now she seems a bit more steady.

"...I'm not lying. You're so beautiful that I had to lie to myself so that I wouldn't notice.
 ...So don't condemn yourself like that. It's not your fault that your body's like that."

My heart thumps.
I talk as I try to suppress the blood from going to my crotch.
It's the last-ditch resistance brought on by my reasoning.
To that...

"Then please make love to me. ...I want you right now, Senpai."
...Sakura destroys it with a heated voice.


It's as if she whispered it by my ear.
Sakura's voice seeps down to my bones and destroys my small reasoning.
No, there's no way to fight it from the start.
No man can stay calm when faced with the naked body of the woman he loves the most.

"Sakura."
"...You don't have to move. ...I'll make you feel good."

Sakura tempts me with words like burning steel.
I understand it in my head.
I know I want Sakura.
My penis is so erect that I can't hide it anymore.
Sakura is wanting me, and Sakura's body is needing magical energymy semen.


Then there's no reason to oppose her.
I can satisfy both if I accept Sakura.
...But...
Wouldn't that keep the most important reason unclear?

"...Senpai."
Sakura's voice is coming from near me.
Sakura's body is right in front of me now.
...I can't move.
Is it because of tension or confusion?
Every part of my body is bound, and I can't stop Sakura.

Her skirt falls to the ground.
...I hears the sounds of clothes being taken off.
Sakura takes off her clothes to get naked, and I'm taking off my shirt even though I can't move by myself

"...Please, Senpai... I can't bear it any longer"
Sakura sounds like she's apologizing.
"Sa... kura."
The zipper on my pants is lowered as soon as I hear her voice.


My reasoning cracks.
My head blanks out when I see her young and vivacious body.

"Ah...... Hm....... I'm going to touch it, Senpai..."
Sakura's fingers touch my erect penis.
She handles it like a valuable object.
She entangles her white fingers around my hot and hard penis.

"Ah, s"
There's no way I can stop her.
Sakura's fingers are touching my thing.
That feels good enough to make me moan.
No matter how much my useless mind tells me to stop, my body is already tempted by Sakura.

"...I'm sorry, Senpai... I know you don't like this, but"
Sakura turns around and slowly lowers her waist.
Hot juice drips down onto my crotch.

"Haa... Hmm... Yours is so hard..."
...The love juice flowing out of her wets my manhood like honey.

"Mm... We have to make sure it's wet..."
Sakura grabs my shaft as if to soak her honey onto my shaft.

"Hold, on"
Her fingers stimulate my body, and I feel something sticky between us.
I'm about to fall from just this, but Sakura is...
"Haa... Hm, mm... Ah, I can, right, Senpai?"
She sighs painfully as if she cannot wait any longer.
And she pushes the head of my penis onto her crevice.

"Ahh... ah, mm, fu..."
"......!"
A slight shock runs through my back.
My erect head enters Sakura with a sound.
Her wet vagina accepts the hard foreign body without resistance.

A wet sound.
The tip, which should be too big to enter Sakura's small hole, easily pushes in between her walls and plunges deeper in.

"Hah, ah...!?"
I don't understand.
Just putting the tip in feels so good that I'm going to go crazy...!

"Hold... on, Sakura......!"
I quickly pull my hips back.
But my body is still numb.
Sakura doesn't listen to me.

"Mm... ha, it's big... butah, haa... It's coming... in"
She breathes with her shoulders and slowly lowers herself.

"Ah......!"
The sound.
I can't bear the sound of me tearing Sakura apart.

"Ah, mm...! Ah, fua, ahhm... Sen... paiSenpai's touching... me..."
Sakura's crevice.
The red part has accepted the tip of it already.
The walls roll up as my penis is pushed in, and at the same time, they try to accept the penetrating object and guide it deeper inside.

"...Haa... Haa, haa, ah..."
It's tight, but not, at the same time.
Sakura's slit and my penis melt and join into each other.
And from behind her too.
We're in such a position, but Sakura's the only one moving.

"Ha"
It feels so good that I want to vomit.
A woman's back is before my very eyes.
Her big butt is squashed in front of me.
I'm piercing Sakura from behind.
It makes me imagine that I'm inserting it in her butt instead of her pussy, and it's all the more unbearable.

"Ah, ah."
"Ha, aha... It's getting bigger, Senpai... Does it feel good...? Mm... aha, ah! ...Ah... It feels good for me too"

I'm scared.
I bear the welling cum because I'm scared.
I grit my teeth and endure the oncoming surges of pleasure.

"Ah... Ah, no... Senpai...? Mm, ahh... um, is it painful...?"
Painful?
No way. It can't be painful when it feels this good.
I'm just scared because I can't suppress myself.

My desire is up to my throat now.
If I can move, I want to push Sakura down and pierce through her.
I'm scared of myself for wanting to fuck Sakura like mad.

"...D-Don't Sakura...! If I continue, I'll"
I'm scared that I might lose my sanity.

"Ah... Haa, hmm, mm...! ...No, I'm sorry, Senpaiah, I can't... stop myself"

"HeyI'm saying... don't...!"
There's no way she'd listen to me.
My cock is deep inside Sakura.
Sohow could she stop now?

"Haa... Mm, the big thing's coming in"
Sakura moves as she moans in an intoxicated voice.
The surge that led me inside is now trying to keep me inside.

"...!"
Her walls are pulsing.
Her thick walls grasp at my penis and softly wrap themselves around it.

"Ah, aha, hm... Can I, Senpai...? It's in, so I'll move now"
Her warm pussy has me caught.
Sakura slowly starts to move up and down.

"Ah, aha, ahh...!"
"......!"
I grit my teeth and bear it.
I will release my cum along with my mind unless I do so.

"Ahh, fua, ah, haa...!
 ...Aha... Goodit's so big."
I'm caressed with numerous fingers and tongues.
Sakura awkwardly moves up and down while squeezing her walls.
"Hah, hmm, mm, mm......!"

A sound of liquid.
Her love juice leaks out.
She's moving as if to taste my penis with her vagina.
It's a diligent service that tells me how she feels.
She's not good, but she's trying her best to please me, and that fact itself is a pleasure.

"Ah, it's touching me inside... It's coming in slowly... Haa... mm, ah...! I'm glad... I'm so happyI'm sorry, Senpai."
Her voice sounds like she's crying and intoxicated at the same time.
Sakura is apologizing, but shaking with pleasure at the same time.

"Hm... mm, fu, mm...! You can see it, right, Senpai...? I'm connected with Senpai... Mm... I'm happy... I always wanted to do this with you, Senpai...!"

...Sakura heats up and starts to move faster.
Her movements were kind, but now they're getting more intense.
She's happy.
Her movements reflect her emotion by sucking, squeezing, and entangling herself on me.

"...Sa... kura"
"Ah, haaI-I'm going to do my best...! So, you too, Senpai...!"

...My reason is melting.
Her walls expand and contract, matching her movements.
They contract when I'm going out, but they suck me in when my tip is reinserted, drawing up my urge to ejaculate.
"Haa... ah!"
It feels so good that I can't keep my mouth closed, and my saliva drips down my chin.

"Mm... Is it too strong, Senpai...? Aha, then... I'll slow down... a bit"
Her juice covers my cock while her butt moves vertically.
"!"
It's like a simple up and down movement, but it's actually a pot of meat that wriggles around from time to time to stimulates my manhood.

"Ah"
...This is hard.
I never thought it'd be this hard to keep my reasoning and suppress my urge to ejaculate.
It feels good inside Sakura.
But it feels like torture as well

"Hm... Ah, aha, mm...! ...Huh? ...I'm going slow... but I can't... stop my hipshm, ha, haa, nhaa, ahh...!"
Sakura's movement does not stop.
A shock goes through my abdomen every time her firm butt presses on it.

"Haa, guh...!"
...Her wet meat.
Her delicate walls vibrate to invite me into the deepest part of her.

"Guhah."
"Hm, nha, why!? Why am Iah, faa, hm, ah...! ...Ah... I'm sorry, SenpaiI'm sorry, Senpai...!"

Sakura apologizes, but her pussy squeezes my erect shaft even harder.
...I could ejaculate any second now.
Our genitals are wet with her juice and my pre-cum.
Sakura's pussy still has some room even after accepting me.
It expands, contracts, wraps itself around me, and squeezes me.
The varying movements are like those of an educated prostitute.

"...Haa... Haa... Hm, ahh... Amazing... Yours is amazing, Senpai"
"Sakura. Please... stop."
"...Ah... Ah, no...! ...Mm, no, I can't, Senpaiahh, mm, I can't stop myself!"

...The swirl greedily demands more.
...My reasoning is crumbling apart.
Her soft walls are like an aphrodisiac.
My penis is wet with aphrodisiac, and the pleasure is melting my brain.

"AhAh"
The overdosage of aphrodisiac causes my form to be vague.
I can only open my mouth and suppress my voice.
...I'm swallowed by pleasure.
I'm like a bug that fell into a pot of aphrodisiac.

"Guh."
My desire washes away my reason.
...This isn't just a pot of aphrodisiac.
This is a never-ending sea of pleasure.
The body accepting me right now is of the finest quality that any man would be addicted to.
That body is telling me to go crazy.
I'm telling Sakura to stop for her sake, but she isn't listening to me.
Thenthere's no need torestrain myself.

"Hm, Senpai... Senpai, please use your hips too... Mm, nha......!"

There's only a fragment of reasoning left in me.
Sakura doesn't know how I can't retreat and keeps moving her hips to pleasure me.

And...
The obscene body that wriggles like a snake...

"Haaah, ah!"
...Crushes my hindering reasoning.

"Ahhau, Senpai...!?"
I raise my hips.
I grab her butt and sink my nails into her hot body.

"! ...! Ahh... haa...!! Faa, mm, aha...! Hmha, it's amazing, Senpai, you're so rough...!"
I plunge into her without any consideration.
I'm ignoring Sakura's condition, but she just shakes her butt in delight.

"Ahmm, haa, ii...! I'm glad... More, Senpai...!"
She raises her indecent ass.
Sakura holds out her body without me ordering her.

"Fuu, nha, ah...! It's big, and thrusting me from behind, ah, hmm......!"
Sakura moans.
She arcs her back and takes the thrusting meat on all fours.

"...! Senpai, Senpai...! Senpai is so, ah, nha, mm...!!!"
I pierce her without hesitation to make up for all the time I couldn't move.
Over and over.
I violently pull back, push in, pull back, and move my penis as if to oppose the welling urge to ejaculate.

"Ya, mm, ah... Hia, ahhhhh...!!!! Senpaiah, hah, amm, ah, fua...!"
It might be painful, as Sakura's voice starts to contain some agony.

But I don't stop.
Our sex turns ferocious.
Sakura tries to accept it and raises her butt.
", Haa"
My vision, the only thing not invaded by the pleasure of Sakura, breaks with that.

Her butt is lewdly raised, exposing her excretory organ.
It squeezes tight.
It's straining as if to bear the pain, and it's closed as if to follow her pussy's example.
It is wet with my pre-cum and her love juice.

"Ahkuh."
The dirtiest place on Sakura is dirtied with our juice.
It's so lewd that I want to start laughing, and it makes me all the more crazy.

"Ahit's embarrassing, Senpai's, aha, ahh, watching my butt...!"
Our juice splatters around every time I push into her, and the juice sticks onto her butt.

"Ah, kuh"
The scene fires up my desire.
Sakura's asshole. I see the place where even Sakura cannot see, and a sense of domination assails me.

"Mm, Senpai...! It's good, it's deeper, ahh, nha, it's good, so good, ahhhh...!"

I keep thrusting.
My thrusts get stronger.
My penis is fully expanded, stirring up Sakura's vagina.
She accepts it painfully.
"It's painfulah, move more, Senpaiplease go harder and squash my butt...!"

And Sakura's walls change as if to match my sexual desire.

"Ha, you!"
The waves of pleasure that I thought were at their limit grow bigger.
My brain is filled with Sakura's sensation and is about to explode.

"Haaaha, haa, ahaa, mm......!"
She desires me without end.
But that's not only her wish, as it is also mine.

"Ah... Mm... no... I'll overflow, hmm, if you do that"
I raise my butt and thrust up.
"Mmm, ah! Ahh, nha, haa... Ah, fuaaaaa...! Senpai, I'm going to come...!"
I don't pull back and rub my tip inside of her.

Dry sounds constantly echo through the room.
The room is stained with the sound of our moving hips, the sound of the juice splashing, and Sakura's moans.

"Haa, ahI like youI like you, I love you, Senpai...! I've loved you for so long, nha, I can't keep it in anymore...!"

"Ah, kuh!"
I keep moving, while Sakura accepts it and shakes.
The pleasure changes every second, not letting me rest.
Her walls change shape every time she arcs her back and stimulates me from different angles.
I feel faint.
My mind is constantly being stimulated and is about to escape my body.

"Fua, haa, ah, ahh, ahh...!!! More, Senpai, together, Senpai...!!!!"
"!"
I can't end easily.
If Sakura wants it, I have to answer her.

"Ahh."
And I want to savor Sakura without end.
I don't need my reasoning.
I don't care even if my mind escapes my body.
I can kick away such nuisances that keep me from being human!

Our membranes rub against each other.
My grotesque member is wet with foaming love juice.
Her contracting walls suck on my blood-congested penis.

", "
It'll end anytime.
I'll ejaculate with the next thrust if I let down my guard.
I frantically grit my teeth, wanting this pleasure to last longer.

"Ah, haa... Hm... Does it feel good, Senpai?"
", Ah"
I can't say anything.
I'll be unable to endure it if I say something.

"If it's goodplease say my namehaa... I want you... Senpai, to say my name...!"
Her pussy contracts with her voice and squeezes me.

"Sakura."
I pierce her.
She doesn't need to tell me.
My head is filled with Sakura and Sakura only.

"Sakura"
"Yes...! Senpai, Senpai...!"
Her back is covered with sweat.
My member is covered with both our juices.
Sakura's crotch is covered with something viscid and is reflecting light like something about to emerge from a pupa.

I'm melting.
My senses are so vague that I'm starting to think I'm melting.

"AhaSenpai called my name... You properly said my name when I'm so indecentnha, Senpai... Senpai, Senpai, Senpai...!!"
Sakura responds every time.
I feel a definite sensation every time she squeezes on me.

"SakuraSakura...!"
My desire gets worse.
Her lewd and meaty butt, her smooth back, her messed hair, her sweet moaning.
Everything is like a dream, and my consciousness is about to...

"NoI, I, I'm!"
It must be the same for Sakura.
The body that desired me raises itself, as if drawing on its last power.

"Ahh, ahh! ...No, I don't want this myself...! II want to feel good with you, Senpai...!"

Her pussy squeezes me with all its might.
"Guh......!"
I thrust it in as if to fight against it.
I feel pain as my impulse breaks the dam.

"Sakura, Sakura......!"
"Nha, ahhno, don't let me go, Senpai...!!!"
I release the strained power.
My restrained desire is let loose as if guided by Sakura's orgasm.

"Ahhmmmm, Senpai... is ejaculating... a lot..."
"!"
My cum ejaculates as if to shoot down her womb.

"Waithey"
Something's wrong.
I've let enough out, but it doesn't stop.

"...Ahh... Mm... Aha, ahh..."
Sakura takes in my hot impurity.
Sakura sounds satisfied and drains her strength.

"Ahkuh."
A long ejaculation I've never experienced before.
My cum fills up Sakura and flows out.
I've let out enough, but it doesn't stop ejaculating.

"Ah... aha, amazing, it's still coming in. Senpai... Senpai's hot juice... it's coming in me and flowing out"
Sakura sounds like she's in a trance.
...My consciousness fades.
I can't hear Sakura's voice.

A never-ending ejaculation.
It's more than what my testicles can generate, and it's a pleasure as if I'm ejaculating my organs out.

  I see a dream after that.

We're both tired and sleep together after having sex.
Sakura hesitated with a blush, but she nodded when I asked her if she wanted to, and came into my futon with a red face.


I'm dreaming.
I'm sleeping and was so tired that I won't wake up till tomorrow, so this has to be a dream.
That's why...
I'm still having sex with Sakura.


I'm desiring Sakura even in my dreams.
That's how exciting the sex with her was.
If it's possible, I want to embrace her and sleep together like this.
...I want to tell her that I love her.
She was filled with pleasure every time she said Senpai, and I want to respond to her affection.


I'm having sex with Sakura.
I'm having sex with her even in my dream.
I'm still having sex with her even though we've already made love like mad.

I had sex, but it wasn't enough, so I'd rather fuck her really violently so that I can really destroy her
"Oh."
What am I thinking?
That's going too far.

"Ah"
My vision wavers.
Sakura's not there.
I was holding on to Sakura, but I'm now holding something strange.

"Ha, ah......"
It's hot.
My foothold is melting.
I'm sinking into an eternal desire.
I'm literally drowning in a sea of pleasure called Sakura.

...I see a violent dream.
I see an ominous dream in a sea of hot coal tar.
Tohsaka's analysis ends rather quickly.
She lit an incense, did something like tarot fortune-telling, and asked me a few personality assessment-like questions.

And Tohsaka says...
"You don't correspond to anything. Further analysis would be useless."
...And quickly gives up diagnosing my Magic Circuit.

"Hey. Does that mean you can't tell?"
And when I ask her...

"Excuse me. I found out that you're not related to the five elements. Any more consecration is out of my expertise, so it's useless to keep going.
 I'll just see what magic you can use and figure out from there."

...That's how it is according to her.
I run through the "strengthening" magic using the clay she prepared.

It's called an ether cluster, and it's a strange object that returns to its original form no matter what happens to it. It's a good conductor of magical energy.
I strengthen it so easily that I'm afraid it won't recover, but...

"It's like shiniku, so don't worry about it. It restores its original state in a day even if you bundle it with strong magical energy."
...She says something like that.
Shiniku, by the way, is meat that never goes away, no matter how much of it you eat.

...Anyway, I keep repeating the strengthening magic on the clay.
I can't fail in front of Tohsaka, but I only succeed two out of ten times.
Activating my Magic Circuit, which was easy when I had Saber, took a lot of time and effort.

Tohsaka asks me a few questions while I cast the strengthening magic.
Whether I'm self-taught, whether I can use any other spells, how Kiritsugu taught me, and what I have the easiest time imagining.

So.
Tohsaka's expression darkens further with each answer I give, and by the end she's shut up entirely.
I don't know what she's angry about, but it's really awkward to be here if she makes a face like that.

"Tohsaka? ...Um, I know it's only a matter of course, but are you regretting cooperating with me because I'm such an amateur?"
I ask her the most likely thing.

"Huh...? Yeah, I do regret that you're an amateur, but in your case, you were taught wrong... Or should I say that I'm surprised you're still alive with the way you're doing things."
Tohsaka ponders.

"...? Heeey, Tohsaka? You lost me."
".........?"
Why is she glaring at me?

"......Fine. I guess if I'm going to correct you, we'll have to start with the fundamentals.  But let's go back to what we were talking about earlier. Is it true that the things you projected are still in your shed?"
"Yeah. Things don't normally go away unless you break them, right?"

I told her that I use projection as a breather in between strengthening magic.
It seems Tohsaka is particular about it, and told me to use projection using the clay.
She told me to make a vase. Everything started out smoothly, but in the end I still failed.

"Hmph. For now, I'll teach you how to turn your switch on and off.
 It's faster to make an actual switch in your body.  Stay over tonight. It's a drastic measure, so you'll have to stay in bed all night."

"What? You mean here?"
"What's with that face? Don't worry. I'm not going to be performing surgery on you. You'll just drink some medicine. Well, you won't be able to move for a while because it's so strong."

"Oh... Um, it's not that I don't like drastic measures..."
...I look at the clock.
It's almost five.
I didn't notice since it's cloudy today, but it's getting late.

Tohsaka is helping me as a fellow magus.
I'm worried about leaving Sakura alone in her condition, but today's an exception.
...Tohsaka's cooperating with me, so she takes precedence.

"...Hey, why the painful look?
 You don't mind taking drastic measures, right? Then just give up and accept it."

"...Yeah, I will. But let me make sure, Tohsaka. This thing will end today, right? I'll really be in trouble if I can't move tomorrow."

"...Well. I can't deny that possibility, to be honest. I can't tell how it'll turn out, and it'll take longer if your body has matured to the point where it can't be tampered with. And there's the possibility of the operation itself failing.
 Well, that's all up to your luck. How's your luck recently, Emiya-kun?"

...It's bad.
It's worse still given that the one asking me holds my fate in her hands.

"...Hold on. That's really troublesome.
 I have to go home by tomorrow."
"Huh? Your home?"

 "Yeah. Sakura's lying sick at my house, so I want to go check on her. I won't be able to rest easy while I'm lying in bed unless I'm sure she's all right."

"CrapI forgot about it."
...She's astonished.
Tohsaka stares at me, bewildered, and...
"You idiot! I wouldn't have kept you here for so long if you'd told me earlier...!"
...As if trying to get back at me, she gives an unexpected response.

"We can talk about the switch later! We can do that at your house!"
"W-What...!?"
She yells at me as she crosses the room and puts on her coat.

"Let's go. We're done with what we have to do here, and we can do the rest at your place. We'll continue as soon as you're done with nursing Sakura, so let's hurry."
"Eho-okay. That'll help me out."

"...Humph. I'll tell you now since I don't want to have to keep remembering this.
 Your nature is in projection and not strengthening.
 I don't know where you made your mistake or what your misunderstanding is, but you're a magus that belongs on the 'side that creates'."
Tohsaka walks off down the hallway.

"...?"
I tilt my head in wonder, but I follow Tohsaka and leave the Tohsaka household.
"Hold on...! Didn't you join forces with me because you couldn't save people by yourself..!?"


I stop.
Her words splash cold water onto my heated brain.

"I'm sorry. But Sakura's in danger. I know it's suicidal to go alone, but this is all I can do."

"...I thought so. But I can't readily help you as long as Shinji is holding Sakura hostage.
 But Emiya-kun. If you can manage to get Sakura back from Shinji, I can do the rest."

"You'll take care of Shinji?"
"No, I'm talking about Rider. Servants are ones who fight other Servants, right?
 I'll be hiding, so do anything you can to save Sakura. If you can manage that, I'll save you no matter what, even if you are about to die in the next second."

Tohsaka sounds like she's trying to convince herself.
...This is just going to increase the burden on her.
I'm fully aware of that. I got Tohsaka to help me, and now Tohsaka's trying to fulfill our promise.

That convinces me.
I'll rely on Tohsaka.
In return, I'm going to get Sakura back.

"All right. I'll leave the follow-up to you."
"Yeah. But that's under the condition that you're still alive to protect Sakura.
 Even Archer can't protect Sakura while fighting Rider. It's meaningless to save Sakura at the cost of your life."

The school building is deserted.
Thanks to the series of comas, the school closed early.
It's not even six o'clock, but there are no students or teachers to be seen.

"Can you tell where Shinji is, Tohsaka?"
"...Knowing him, he's probably inside. I'm sure he's waiting in familiar territory on an upper floor."
That could only be one place.
Shinji is in the classroom on the third floor.

"I'll go ahead. You come later, Tohsaka."
"...Okay. I'll go through the gate after ten minutes.
 I didn't tell you, but a boundary field's set up here. I'll be found even if I hide my presence, so keep their attention so they don't notice me."

I nod and start running.
There's hot steel in my back.
The Magic Circuit is already made.
I tell myself that my only weapon is meant to protect Sakura, not to harm my enemy.

"...!"
I stop.
On the third floor hallway are a black Servant and Shinji, holding a knife at Sakura.

"You!"
My mind explodes.
My feet start to move again.
Thenthe black Servant blocks my way.

"Stop. My Master will harm her if you take another step."
"...!"
I slide to an abrupt halt.
My mouth hurts.
I'm gritting my teeth so hard that they're screaming.

"Shinji!"
"Yo. Just like I thought, you came flying over here. I knew you would come alone if I told you to."

"!"
My cool brain boils up once again.
My head shakes so much that I almost forget about the Servant in front of me.

"...What is that?"
Why is he doing such a thing?

Sakura is Shinji's sister.
An older brother should protect his younger sister.
Family members should help each other and laugh together.
So why doesn't he understand?
     Something I couldn't protect.
Why can't he understand how Sakura must feel to have her own brother holding a knife to her!?

"Are you serious, Shinji?"
"Of course. I'm using the last trump card because I'm serious. Why are you stupid even at a time like this?"

"...!"
Before I know it, I'm running.
I can't stop until I get Sakura away from him.


But she's in my way.
Rider is blocking my way, protecting Shinji.

"...I do not understand. Why did you come here?
 In coming here, you showed you were willing to obey my Master. If you planned to fight, you should not have come alone."

"!"
...Rider's right.
...I have to calm down.
Since I obeyed Shinji, I have to think only about saving Sakura and not defeating Shinji.

"Phew."
I take a deep breath and pull myself together.

Shinji is enjoying my dismay with Sakura in his arms.
...Sakura hasn't raised her head since I arrived.
She's not unconscious.
She's standing unassisted.
Her head is down because she doesn't want to raise it.

"Shinji. Did you tell her about us?"
I glare at him, unable to hide my anger.
"Huh?"

"Oh. Oh, I see!
 Yeah, don't worry, Emiya. Since you wouldn't tell her, I told her everything! I told her we're both Masters and tried to kill each other!"

"!"
"Did you want to hide that from her? Are you stupid? Of course she'll find out! She knew you were hiding something, but she couldn't ask you because she's just your underclassman!"
"......!"

He presses the blade against Sakura's cheek.
Sakura looks away, but grits her teeth so that she won't raise her face.

"Come on, don't be reserved and ask. Emiya won't hide anything now. See, it's your wish come true!"

She doesn't reply.
With her head down...

"Hey. Why aren't you saying anything?
 I told you to ask him. I'm telling you to ask him what he thinks of you and if he hates you after finding out that you're a dirty woman of Matou!"

"Shinji!"
...Her figure looks like she's apologizing to me, and I can't contain myself anymore.

"It's fine now, right? I came here, just like I promised. Let Sakura go."
"What? I didn't promise you anything. I gave you a command.
 I just said I wouldn't do anything to Sakura if you came alone."


"Don't glare so much, Emiya. I'm not a devil. I'm glad that you want to save my sister. I'll meet your sincerity if you act accordingly. I can send Sakura home once we're done.

"I seeis that a promise, Shinji?"
"Yeah. I'll let Sakura go if you do as I say.
 This is a promise. I swear."

"All right. So, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to get on my knees and beg?"
"Nope. What's the fun in making a guy beg? I brought you here to fight. I told you we're settling our match."

...Rider takes a step forward.
There's no enmity or intent to kill.
Rider steps forward to obey her Master.

"But it's boring to just fight, right? It's not fair since I'm not a magus, and it's obvious that I'll win in a fight.
 So to be fair, I'll have her fight you."

"!"
...Heh.
Fight Rider empty-handed, huh?
That's like telling me to die.

"I won't take your life. I've told Rider to go easy on you.
 Well, I'm sure you'll be a nuisance if you keep running around after today, so I'll have her break your limbs."

...Rider is not holding her dagger.
It seems she really is going to go easy on me.

"Isn't your job easy? You just have to stand there and get hit like a dumbass.
 Oh, but don't go down too soon, okay? If you faint before I'm satisfied, I'll have Sakura take the rest."


...Rider comes closer.
Three more steps.
Then I'll be within her reach.

"...Heh. Don't resist, but don't go down easily?
 You're contradicting yourself. What do you want, Shinji?"

"Hah, that's obvious, isn't it...!?
 I just want to beat the crap out of you...!!"

Rider springs forward.

I raise both my arms in preparation for her attack.
At that instant
An impact that almost blows the bones away with it pierces my right arm.

"Guh!"
She aimed at my arm that was guarding my face.
My arm is still attached.
But it's numb and I don't feel anything.

"Haa......!"
I lace my senses as fast as possible.
I can't do anything bare-handed.
Unless I strengthen everything that can be strengthened, my limbs will be torn clean off.
I have to turn my uniform into steel and turn my body into something even stronger, or the next attack will kill me!

"!"
A tremor runs through my left arm.
The blow like a bushhammer penetrates through my strengthened uniform and tries to break my left arm.

"Haayou!"
Both my arms have been rendered useless in a mere second.
No, they do move, but I don't feel them.
I can't use my deadened arms to block her attacks.
If she takes another shot at my head now, I'll be knocked out for sure...!

Rider is merciless.
She beats me relentlessly, just as Shinji ordered.
Her movements remind me of a machine.

"Ah, guh......!"
I protect my face with arms that barely move.
From the start, I can't perceive Rider's attacks to block them accordingly.
I have to concentrate on guarding my head so that I won't get knocked unconscious.

"Kuh, guh!"
What is Rider thinking?
Even though my arms are an easy target, she ignores them.
She only hits my exposed chest and stomach.
...They are agonizing blows, but aren't as strong as the attacks that numbed my arms.

", "
...It's strange.
With the strength Rider showed at the Ryudou Temple, a single blow should be enough to tear me in half.
...Is she going easy like Shinji said?
Well, she is going easy on me by not aiming at my face, but even with that in mind, something's not right.

"!"
In short, her power is way too different.
A Servant's power is in direct proportion to the magical energy you can feel from them.

Rider was a strong Servant back at the Ryudou Temple.
But the Rider before me now is the Rider that was defeated at the park.
I don't know what happened, but if that's the case, I still have a chance to outwit Shinji!

"Gu, fu...!"
I fall forward.
Seemingly tired of using me like a punching bag, she steps forward and drives her fist into my stomach.


It's like a stake gouging into my abdomen.
...The attack is really effective.
The bruises from last night are screaming with pain.
Gastric juice fills my mouth and I almost fall down to my knees.

"What, is that it, Emiya? That's pitiful. You're in front of Sakura, so take it like a man!"
...I fall forward.


Rider steps back and watches.

Then...
"Ahh......!"
I grab Rider's arm and force myself up.

"! That's good, Emiya! You're as persistent as a roach!
 Ahaha, you're hilarious!"
Ah... guh.
Damn, that hurts. My head is spinning, even though she didn't hit me there

"But, well... This is a third-rate show. Even if we continue, it'll just be more of the same. I'm getting bored, so let's finish it off with an exciting knockout scene."

The same?
Are you stupid? What's the same about this?
We're standing in a different position now.
Hasn't he noticed that I switched positions with Rider when I pulled myself up using her arm?

"There are about five more meters. Your patience has won out."
"What...?"
I raise my head.
What did Rider just say?

"Enough resting. Start the second round, Emiya."
Rider shakes off my hand.
The black Servant resumes her attacks with the artificiality of a machine.

I'm being pushed back.
To avoid finishing me off, Rider's attacks stay clear of my vital areas.


My body is numb.
I'm bruised everywhere I got hit, and I don't feel pain anymore.
It's because the pain from within is worse than her attacks.
Rider has attacked me to destroy my body.

"Prepare yourself."
The black Servant closes the distance with an emotionless voice.

And in that moment, I am certain.
This isn't part of Shinji's plan.
Rider's decision not to go for my head, and that I can still move my body...
It's not because Shinji ordered her to go easy on me, but

"All right, you don't have to hold back anymore! Kill him, Rider!"
"...!? Nii-san, stop...!"

Rider's hair flutters as she steps in...
...and hits me in the chest with her most powerful strike yet.

"Guh"
I can't breathe.
I don't feel the ground anymore.
Her attack almost blows me unconscious even though I knew it was coming.

"Senpai...!"

I hear a scream and a delighted laugh as I fly through the air.
...Sakura's voice is close.

I fall.
Under normal circumstances, I would've hit the floor and died.
The impact of the fall doesn't matter.
It's an attack strong enough to blow a human away.
It wouldn't be surprising if the strike blew a hole in my chest.

"......Hah."
But I'm alive.
Anyone can jump back if the timing is set so perfectly.
That attack wasn't meant to kill me.
She's kept me conscious and mobile, not because of Shinji's order, butof her own free will.

"Now."
The range is perfect.
I turn my body right before I hit the ground, straighten myself instantly, 
"Huh?"
and grab the knife in front of me with my left hand.

I catch it by the blade.
I don't care about it digging into my hand because it's numb.

"W-What!?"
I raise my other arm.
Without a thought for the pain...

I punch him square in the face with my clenched fist.
"I'm not prepared for such a thing. I came back for Sakura."
"!"

"I see. I get your point.
 You're going to protect Sakura over other people, right?"
"Yeah. Don't say I'm mistaken. If you're going to kill Sakura, I'll stop you."

"Stop me? I think not. You can't even move an inch, let alone stop me. You can't interfere, no matter how badly you want to protect her."

Tohsaka's voice contains no emotion.
And...
"What......?"
...I try to react and realize that I can't even move a finger.

"Guh...!? Tohsaka, you...!"
"...You said I can't say you're mistaken. But you did make a mistake. If you wanted to follow your own path, you shouldn't have given me the right to decide."


My heart beats loudly.
No, it's not my heart, but the bind made right beside my heart.

It's nothing.
It was an ideal answer.
I'm not satisfied, but if that's what you say, that's how it'll be.

"Curse of coercion..."

"Yes. It was just horseplay, but I never thought it would come in handy like this. You can't go against me from the moment you swore absolute obedience to me.
 ...You made a contract with me instead of making a promise. Instead of being my ally, you chose to be my servant."

"Wha"
"I'm going to go kill Sakura, Emiya-kun. But don't get it wrong. You couldn't have stopped me even if you didn't have the geas.
 This is my duty. You're not at fault here."

"! Tohsaka, w"
I can't even tell her to wait.

...Tohsaka leaves.
"No waywhy?"
I still can't move.

"Damn, don't kid me! Why!?"
I struggle with all my might.
I have to free myself quickly.
I fight the binding, hoping that it's not too late.

And suddenly, I'm free once again.


My feet won't move to follow her.
Though I've been freed, I'm still frozen in place.
And then I understand.
My body stopped moving when I defied Tohsaka.
Then...
Have I been freed because there's no longer a need to hold me here?

"Sakura."
My legs give way.
Without a place to go, my mind breaks.

My vision loses light and stains the church black.
Emiya Shirou is in weightlessness.
I threw away my previous ideal to protect Sakura.
It's a new path that I can't yield to anyone.
But I've already lost the person on whom I'd depended.

The fight will continue.
The Holy Grail War will continue, and I will end the war along with Tohsaka, the one who killed Sakura.

...But that is no longer my concern.
Emiya Shirou's position has been eternally lost.
From now on, I must continue onward with neither a guide nor a goal
It seems Sakura is in critical condition.
The liquid that came out of her earring was poison, and Kotomine is purifying it now.

Tohsaka doesn't say anything.
Neither Archer nor Rider are here.
Only the two of us are in the church, waiting for Kotomine's return.

"Tohsaka."
Still sitting down, I call out to her.
"What?"
"I want to ask you something."

"......I thought so. Fine, I'll tell you. It's no use hiding it from you, and it's meaningless to do so now.
 So you want to ask about Sakura?"

I nod.
Tohsaka takes a deep breath and starts to talk in her normal tone.

"It all started quite some time ago. The Matou blood started to run thin, and their children were born with fewer and fewer Magic Circuits.
 The family is originally from another country, so I think the land of Japan didn't suit them.
 Their decline started when they started living here, and the Magic Circuit finally disappeared in this generation when Shinji was born."

"...The history of Matou ended with that.
 They should have taken an apprentice or something if they'd wanted their quest to continue.  But the Matous are a distinguished family, and to the last, they refused to take in an outsider.

"As a result, their successors had less magical energy, and it finally ran out in the end.
 ...They finally started looking for an apprentice when that happened, but no magus would come to a fallen family. Hundreds of years of Makiri history should have ended at that time."

"But they weren't people who could give up then. Shinji's father adopted a child and taught the child magic."

"So.
 I expect you wouldn't know because your family is a special case, but a family of magi hands down its secrets to only one child. They don't teach magic to any other children. Zouken said this, right?
 If there is a sibling, one is your successor, while the other is raised normally or put up for adoption."


There's no need for two successors.
In a case of siblings... no, "sisters", what would be done to the one who wasn't needed?

Some may raise her and hide from her the fact that they are a family of magi.
But that's difficult and inefficient.
If they trained their Magic Circuit over many generations, it would not be their wish to waste the excellent gene even if she is not chosen as the successor.
Then

"Tohsaka."
"Yes. I had a sister a year younger than me.
 ...The declined Matou family had no hope of someone giving them a child for adoption.
 It's only natural for them to rely on the Tohsaka family, the ones they held a pact with for a long time."

"I don't know which one of us my dad intended to make his successor. But I remained a Tohsaka, and she was taken to the Matou family.
 That was eleven years ago.
 I couldn't go see her much after that. It was an agreement made with Matou, and I couldn't readily go see the successor of the Matous."

"I see. Then you and Sakura are..."
"Real sisters. ...Well, we never called each other like that."

...I don't know how much emotion is contained in those simple words.
But that makes me understand.
Why she always asked about Sakura.
Why she didn't let Archer use his Noble Phantasm.

"...That's good. You're on Sakura's side."
A dim light shines into the gloom of my mind.
...I don't know what's going to happen to Sakura, or what she's going to do from now on.
But if Tohsaka cares for Sakura, there just might be hope waiting on the ominous path ahead.

"No. I'm not her ally or anything."
But...
Tohsaka denies me as if reading my thoughts.

"Not her ally...?"
"Right. If Sakura can't be cured, I'll dispose of her, just like I would with any other Master gone rampant. I can't sit idly by while a magus indiscriminately attacks people. If Kirei can't treat Sakura, then I'll just have to get rid of her myself."

"WWhat are you saying...!? Sakura's your sister, isn't she!? Don't ever say something like that...!"

"Sakura is a child of the Matous. She stopped being my sister eleven years ago."
"Tohsaka, you"

"...Hmph. The outcome won't change even if Sakura is my family as you say. It wouldn't change anything. In fact, that would give you even less right to interfere."
Tohsaka speaks as if it's a matter of course.

"Then you're..."
No different from Shinji.
But before I can say the worst thing possible...

"What are you doing? The operation is complete, but she is still in critical condition. If you want to make a commotion, go do so outside."
...Kotomine Kirei emerges from the back of the church.

"...Hmph. I can't tell if you two are on bad terms or in good harmony."

"Oh"
"H-Heh. You're just mistaken."

"I see. Then sit down. I shall explain the state Matou Sakura is in."



Taking our separate seats, we listen intently to the priest.

"To put it simply, there is a poison, a worm, in Matou Sakura's body. The worm is called crest worm. It is like an artificial sanshi, the three corpses. Do you recognize this name?"

...I shake my head.
Sanshia bug said to inhabit a human body that reports the person's evil deeds to the Judge of Hell.
I've heard of sanshi, but I've never heard of a crest worm.

"So you do not know. Well, it was originally just a harmless parasite.
 It's a familiar that lives off of its host's magical energy. It is of the lowest rank of familiars, as it does nothing beyond telling its master whether or not its host still lives."

"......I see. So it's like a monitoring device.
 So Zouken's monitoring Sakura with that?"
"Oh. When was it decided that Matou Zouken is the master of the crest worm?"

"I'm sorry, but I'm in no mood for your long talk. Who else but that old bastard would do something like that to Sakura?"
"I see, that is certainly true. Matou Shinji cannot use crest worms. So it can only be that vampire."

"Right? Just go ahead and tell me the result. Can Sakura be saved or not?"

"You are being hasty, Rin. You seem to understand her condition, but the boy does not. We should explain for his sake, right?"
"......!"
Tohsaka looks away awkwardly.
Judging by her expression, she doesn't want me to find out.

"Well, what shall we do, Emiya Shirou? Rin says she just wants to know the result."
"......No. Please explain things in order, Kotomine."

...I'm sorry for Tohsaka.
But I can't yield to her about this. If this has to do with Sakura's life, I have to know everything about it.

"Then let me continue.
 The crest worm I explained earlier is undermining Matou Sakura's nerves.
 It must be the result of eleven years spent growing within her. The crest worm has turned into a nerve, like a Magic Circuit, and it has entangled with her own, swarming all throughout her body.
 It has transformed into her Magic Crest.  Under normal circumstances it is suspended, having no effect on Matou Sakura's body."

"But once activated, it will violate Matou Sakura's nerves and will keep moving using her magical energy.
 That's what happened earlier. The crest worm roamed through her body, absorbing her magical energy."

"Had she remained in that state for half a day, she would certainly have died.
 The crest worm would suck all of her magical energy as its power, then eat her flesh as nutrition. It means she would have her body consumed after her magical energy was sucked dry."

"If you have a Magic Crest, you should well know how painful it is.
 Even the faintest trace of a foreign substance puts a human body through discomfort, and can even be life-threatening. Having another creature entwining its nerves with your own, moving within you, would easily be enough to kill you."

"......In that regard, I'm surprised Matou Sakura was conscious until just now.
 I do not know if Matou Sakura has a strong will, or if she is just used to the crest worm's activation. We will need to ask her if we want this answered."


I hear a sound.
It's the sound of my teeth grinding.
'If you have a Magic Crest, you should well know how painful it is'?

I couldn't possibly know.
I cover myself in sweat just to insert one Magic Circuit into my body.
Sakura has it several times worse.
I couldn't even guess at her pain.

"...Hold on. You said if it's activated, right? Then the crest worm isn't usually active?"

"That is correct. The poison put on her only awakens the crest worm.
 The crest worm is only an observation device.
 It is only activated as punishment for the host, Matou Sakura, when she breaks a 'certain condition'."


Just listening to his words makes me go crazy.
I know it's not something Kotomine did, but I almost attack him for saying that.

I suppress my selfish emotion and...
"What is the condition?"
I urge him to go on and tell me the heart of the matter.

"Matou Sakura fell, and Rin tried to save her. But Rider prevented her from doing so.
 Then the condition is obvious. To abandon the battles as a Master. That should be the restriction of the crest worm."

"She has approved of the battles by entrusting Rider to Shinji. But the crest worm will torment her as she refuses it now. It has calmed down for now, but the crest worm will keep tormenting her.
 It will tell her, 'What are you doing?
 If you are truly a Master, then go kill the other Masters.
 If you cannot, I will eat you and kill you'."


My mind almost breaks down.
Just hearing about it makes sparks flash in my vision.  More than anything, I want to kill that old man.

"...That's the condition Sakura must follow?"
"It seems so. Nothing else seems likely."
"Then! Can't she just not be a Master? If she uses up her Command Spell and cancels the contract with her Servant, she won't be a Master anymore"

"I would not recommend that.
 I told you that the condition of the crest worm's activation is to abandon her duty as a Master.
 If she cancels her contract with Rider, the crest worm will consume her for sure."

"I see. So she can fight and survive, or refuse to fight and be killed by the crest worm. Those are the only options Sakura has, right?"

"Right. The crest worm will torment its host for as long as the Holy Grail War continues.
 If her condition keeps up, her body will not last long, and her mind will be destroyed. She has a Magic Crest all over her body, after all.
 You should understand how absurd that is, Rin."

"...Yeah. Even though it should be familiar with my body, I still periodically get the urge to cut off my arm.
 I'm like this with one arm, so her function as a human being should be violated if she has it all over her body.
 She's no magus, but a cluster of Magic Circuit. The human mind should be overwritten by the wave of magical energy."

"Whathen Sakura is..."
"She is in danger if her condition keeps up.
 I don't know how many more days she can last, but the crest worm will spread further with each successive day. She will die if we cannot remove it before it infects her whole body, but her body will not last that long in any case."

"The only thing I did was to purify the poison.
 The surgery to call back her lost magical energy and mind is after this, but the chance of success is very low.
 That is all.
 To sum everything up, Matou Sakura cannot be saved. Are you satisfied now, Emiya Shirou?"


There's no way I'm satisfied.
Sakura can't be saved?
That's ridiculous.
She was doing so well until yesterday, so why are things like this now...!?

"What about removing it? Can't you extract the crest worm?
 If you know it's there, you should be able to take it out, right!?"

"Extraction would be difficult. The crest worm has already integrated itself into her Magic Circuits. Even the one who implanted it wouldn't be able to extract it now.
 ...Yes. If you wanted to extract it, you would have to rely on a miracle, or the Holy Grail."

"!"
The Holy Grail.
So that's where it ends up, huh?
Sakura's only choice is to keep fighting as a Master, and the power of the Holy Grail is the only thing that can save her?

"I understand the situation now, Kirei. Let me thank you."
She bows without showing much gratitude and confronts the priest.

"But isn't this too sudden? The crest worm wasn't implanted in her yesterday. So why did she suddenly reach her limit?"

"Why do you ask that now?
 Matou Sakura's body was tampered with many years ago. The changes were so extensive that even her hair and eye colors no longer reflect her heritage. This did not start recently."

"Well, it seems it was never intended to kill her as it's doing now.
 It seems Matou Zouken did not intend to use Matou Sakura in this war. She is not adjusted to fighting. I would assume she was treated that way because unexpected conditions were met."

"Unexpected conditions, huh? ...I don't know what those are, but that means Sakura suddenly won Zouken's confidence?"

"Probably. I would assume some change occurred within her that Zouken did not expect.
 But that is only one factor. There are other reasons for her drastic change.
 She is now constantly using magical energy to maintain her Servant. If she cannot spare any for her crest worm, what will the starving worm do?"

"...I see. Regardless of the conditions, it'll drain her body to acquire the magical energy it's not getting
 But she wouldn't lose magical energy if she doesn't use Rider, so"

"Yes, she should be able to live as before, for a while.
 But I don't think the old man will let Matou Sakura do as she wishes."

"......Right. He wouldn't plant a creature like that in her otherwise.
 The worm will kill her if she doesn't fight,  and her body will also be destroyed if she fights and uses up magical energy.
 No, not only that, but Zouken can do anything he wants with Sakura because he's the one who planted the worm in her."

"He can do anything he wants with Sakura...?"
"Yes. Zouken is holding Sakura's life in his hands. So defeating Zouken is the only way to save Sakura.
 But Emiya-kun.
 You have to defeat Sakura before you can defeat Zouken. She's his puppet. I'm sure he would use her as his shield if you corner him."

"Exactly. Matou Sakura is a convenient tool for Zouken. He will control Matou Sakura as he instigated Matou Shinji.
 In fact, she is superior as a Master. She is urged on by her worm, and she will run even wilder than Matou Shinji, just like Zouken wants."
"!"

"...But I will be a bit irritated if everything goes his way.
 I will perform the surgery on Matou Sakura. I have purified her poison and anesthetized her. The healing and the extraction of the crest worm will be performed next."

"Huh...? Hey, Kirei..."
"It is hopeless, but I will do my best. I cannot simply allow Matou Sakura to die. And what sort of priest would I be if all I could do was rely on the Holy Grail?"


Tohsaka's surprise is natural.
His words are surprising even to me, and I've only known him for a short while.
...This isn't a guess, but a conviction.
Kotomine is seriously trying to save Sakura.
It might just be because he's a priest, but this is too much even for that.

"...What's going on? This is the first time I've seen you support someone like this."
"It's not just a whim. It is simply too wasteful to let her die.
 Well, I suppose it is better for the two of you to have another Master eliminated."

The priest's response is plain.
Tohsaka glares at the priest...
"I'll leave her to you. I'm going to come back when the surgery should be over."
...And leaves the church with those words.

Tohsaka leaves, and the church regains its silence.
The priest silently sees Tohsaka off, and I can't even stand up because I can't think of anything.

"What are you doing? You are of no use to me here. I want no distractions. Go kill some time until the surgery ends."
"I won't bother you. I trust you when it comes to surgeries. You helped that woman before too."

"Hah. The scale of this surgery is much greater than before.
 Matou Sakura stopped herself by shooting herself. She is suffering from autointoxication probably because she harmed you. To put it simply, she killed her own mind to stop herself since she was controlled by Zouken."

"The procedure I'm about to perform is like starting a heart that has stopped. ...Well, the crest worm has kept her body alive. If all I have to do is recover her mind, it should succeed."

"But your presence here is a liability.  If you come barging in when you hear her scream, I will certainly fail. In any case, you bear no responsibility for her sufferings. You and Matou Sakura are strangers now."

"Strangers?"
"I am telling you not to have any sympathy for her.
 There is nothing you can do. Leave, like Rin has done."

"Why? Can't I pray for her sake here if I can't do anything?"
"That is a crime. You have no right to share her pain.
 Do you not understand? I am telling you the surgery will fail if you are here. You are only a harmful enemy to Sakura right now."

"Wh"
I can't finish my sentence.
His words are heavy, and they are pointing out the crimes I didn't know I had committed.

"Matou Sakura feels some kind of guilt towards you. If you are near her, she may refuse to wake up."
"...Guilt towards me...?"

"Yes. It is more like repentance than guilt.
 She is a victim of sexual abuse. It is easy to imagine the kind of training Matou Zouken imposed on her.
 To state the fact,  Matou Sakura is not a pure virgin, but a woman who knows men."


I'm not surprised.
I know this feeling.
It's just like when I found out Sakura was a Master.
I silently accepted the truth when I saw the Command Spell on her hand.

"The girl tried to hide that fact from you, but always sought salvation.
 I don't know how long the abuse called inheritance of magic lasted."

"Butwhat do you honestly think you can do now, when you stood by her side, completely oblivious, for all that time?
 That's what I mean by you not having the right to pray here. But if you still care for Matou Sakura, leave. That's all you can do for now."


...I get up.
  It's not that he's talked me into it.
It's just thatwhat he's saying is correct.
I shouldn't be here if I really care for Sakura.
I shouldn't be allowed to care for Sakura when I can't think at all.

I turn my back to the priest and head for the door.
"Oh. I do not think I even need to mention this, but..."
I don't have the composure to turn around.
I stop, still facing the exit.

"That incident you mentioned earlier. A woman was attacked when Matou Shinji still controlled Rider. She was saved thanks to you, but she would have died under normal circumstances."


I'm pissed.
Somehow, I understand why he's bringing this up now.

"That's right. I need not mention who is at fault here. When Servants attack people, the responsibility lies on the Master."

"Are you saying Sakura's at fault?"
"Of course not. I am only talking about the responsibility. I am not talking about good and evil. In reality, that woman is alive because of you."

But...
If I made a wrong decision back then, Rider would've killed that woman.

That means
"Yes, this is about the future.
 If Matou Sakura recovers, it will be the same in the end.
 The same thing is bound to happen again even if she regains her consciousness.
 Which one will you protect then?"

We don't know when Sakura might do the same thing.


I have nothing to say to him.
I quickly make my way to the exit as if to run away from his words.

"Emiya Shirou. Do you remember why you became a Master?"

I grit my teeth and walk on.
His words are an ultimatum.

"You said you would be a superhero.
 Then make your decision.
 Will you, or will you not cast aside your own desires like Emiya Kiritsuguto protect your ideal and your belief."

I shut the door.
The door to God's house is heavy like the cross.

I'm sure I'll regret it if I lie to myself and keep going.

Where the responsibility lies, existence of good and evil.
Losing Sakura will weigh more heavily on me than either of those things.
...I don't even need to think about it.
I just want to protect Sakura, that's all.

"Yeah. It's a matter of course to protect the girl you like. Even I know that, Ilya."
"Right? I'm your ally because you're that kind of person."

Ilya smiles delightedly.

Her innocence encourages me.
...I don't know if this is the right choice or not.
But I do know I won't regret it.

"I'm sorry, Ilya. I have to get going."
"Yeah. I'll forgive you since you have that expression. Let's meet again, Shirou."
"Yeah. See ya, Ilya. And thank you."

I leave the park.
I start running to the church as if to shake off my doubts.


...My answer's determined.
I don't know how much Sakura supported me after my father died.

The girl I tried to see as just another fellow student.
I kept on deceiving myself because I wanted her to stay by my side.
But such deception will no longer work.

Emiya Shirou does not want to lose Matou Sakura.
That's all.
If I can't think things through, I'll just have to trust in the only definite feeling I have.

...But within my determination...
'If you are to protect just one person'

...I can't shake off Archer's premonitory words.

Rain starts.
The winter rain mercilessly shoots down at me as I run.
...Dragging sounds.
These sounds are familiar.
They are the sounds of crawling worms.


This place is familiar as well.
The dark, damp, secret room.
An underground mausoleum.
This green room is the first room given to her after she was adopted by the Matou family.


A lone figure stands in the center of the room.
...It may not be human, but its appearance is that of a human.
This figure called for her, commanding her to fight in Matou Shinji's place.


She was prepared for this.
At the very least, she accepted the possibility up until two days ago.
But now her determination is gone.
Once she discovered that Emiya Shirou is a Master, her will to fight left her.

She visited the Emiya household to keep watch over him.
But Emiya Shirou did not have the aptitude to become a Master, and he had no knowledge of the Holy Grail War.
That fact became clear at once. Thus, there was never a reason to keep watch over him.
She stayed as his underclassman, using the role of keeping watch over him as an excuse.

She had an optimistic view that there would be no need to fight him.
Although she knew her true identity may be revealed at some point, she never dreamed that they would end up fighting one another.
Sohow did it come to this?

"...Grandfather. Do all Masters need to be killed?"

She knows what the old man's reply is going to be.
She knows, but she can only ask.
But...
"Well. You can keep one or two as playthings, if you like. All I want is their Servants. After stealing them, you may turn the Masters into your toys or puppets."
The old man's answer is not what she expected.

"What...?"

"Do you not understand? I said there is no need to kill all the Masters. We will eliminate those that are dangerous to keep alive, but those who will not be obstacles can be spared.
 It is the wish of my cute granddaughter, so I shall be a bit flexible, even if this is our greatest desire."

Hearing his words, she lowers her guard a bit.
...The old man becomes strangely kind sometimes.
When teaching her the family's magic, he is an inhuman monster, as cruel as a beast.
But sometimes, when they are talking, he becomes just a good-natured old man.

"......"

But she cannot be deceived.
She does not know if this is a whim or a calculated act of kindness. Moreover, she knows she will end up fighting him if she agrees.
Even if she does not have to kill him, just having to fight him is bad enough.

"Is that still not enough? ...My, you are a troubling one. That cowardice will prevent you from ever obtaining what you desire. Look, this is a good opportunity. If you want something, take it by force.
 Sakura. How long do you plan to remain a mere watcher? Reach out and claim your desire. You have the power and the right."

"......"

She does not answer.
First of all, there is nothing she wants.
She admires him, but she would never expect him to accept her.

She is impure. She is not suited for him.
So someone more appropriate should stand next to him.
All she wanted was to be by his side until that time came.
It'll all be ruined if she wishes for anything more.
...Not only her...
He, too, will come to a bad end.

"...Grandfather. I cannot fight. I will give Rider to Nii-san."

She speaks with a trembling voice, prepared for re-education.
She knows what awaits her for disobeying him.
The fear of being thrown to the worms, of losing one's sensation, is something one can never get used to.
The longest she was able to keep her sanity was two hours.
She almost goes crazy, thinking that she will have to endure many times that, no, at worst until the Holy Grail War ends.

"......"

Her body trembles.
Fear of punishment makes her want to scream.
...But it is not the pain that she fears.
All she fears is...
...That when the pain becomes unbearable, she will do as he commands.

".........Hm. It cannot be helped, I suppose. I cannot force you and lose my valuable successor. I shall remain an observer as well in this war."



She gasps.
She does not know how serious he is, but he has accepted her excuse.
The trembling goes away, replaced by a warm sense of relief.

But into that defenseless mind...
"But it is a bit disappointing. Looking at all the Masters in this war, the daughter of Tohsaka is looking pretty good. The unlikely might happen if luck favors her."
...Enters the old man's disappointed voice.

"Nee-san is?"

Evil enters at that time.
She knows it intuitively.
Nee-san will certainly win. She is that kind of a person. She obtains everything she wants and passes through as if it's natural.
...Nee-san will take everything she wants without even a glance towards her, the one standing in place.
ThenNee-san will win.



Her body turns cold as ice.
...She doesn't care about that.
She's used to it.
She's used to it.
She's used to it.
She's used to such treatment.

Nee-san will take it all.
Nee-san is going to eliminate everything, the pain she went through, the bright future ahead of her, and the only person she can rely on



...The ground wavers beneath her.
The words make her dizzy and nauseous.
...Her chest is hurting.
Something unpleasant assails her.
...As if a needle is in her chest.

...It has started raining.
The chilly winter rain mercilessly beats against the gutters.


She slowly opens her eyes.
...It seems she was dreaming about what happened a few days ago.
She is sleeping on an operating table in a room made of stone.
In front of her is a black priest she has never seen before.

"You are finally awake. Do I need to explain to you what is going on, Matou Sakura?"
".........No. It's my body. I know all about it."
She answers simply.
She does not focus on him, but on the sound of the rain against the walls.

"All right. Then get changed quickly. Tohsaka Rin and Emiya Shirou are waiting in the next room. We have to explain your situation to them. You cannot run after that if you are naked, right?"
"......Are you going to let me run away?"
"That is your decision. I merely helped you. It is not for me to plan your actions for you.
 Well, it was a waste for me to save you if you die. I do want you to remain until the very end, though."

"...Why is that?"
"It is more fun that way. Tohsaka Rin and Emiya Shirou will suffer more if you live. It is delightful the more sufferers there are."
The priest turns his back after he answers.
The priest will go to the chapel now.
He does not look back at her, hugging her knees on the operating table.

"Well. Will they kill you, or will they let you live? You may wait here if you are interested in their decision. Though it does not look it, this building has a flimsy structure. For some reason, you can hear all the conversation going on in the chapel."
He smiles and leaves.

"......Senpai. What should I do?"
She embraces her knees.
The quiet weeping is drowned out by the sound of rain.
Hi, is everyone doing well?
This is the Tiger Dojo, the place to save those who fought hard in vain and died!

...Wait, the ground's shaking...

We have taken over Tiger Dojo!
Disarm yourself, Taiga!

That voice, former pupil number one...!?
Hey, what's goingwhaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?

Tiger!
Look, Taiga! This is our secret weapon!

Ready, target the Tiger Dojo!
Gunner, fire!

CHEEEEEEEEEEEST!!!!!

......Huh?

Kyaaaaaaaaaa!???

Tiger! The Tiger I got from the former ***** army has been destroyed in one blow!?

Yes! I'm surprised as well!
By the way, Private First Class Ilya! I was really surprised that you came with a tank!

Oh... Teehee. I overdid it trying to surprise you. Am I full of fun?

I'll kill you!

Osu, thank you (cry).

It's fine if you understand.

I'd usually pull this joke a bit more, but it's getting tiresome, so I'll let you become my pupil again!

 Eh, really, master?

Yup, really. There are twelve more Tiger Dojos.
I can't handle them all by myself.

Actually, I don't know what you'll come attacking with next if I let you loose.

All right! Regular role get!
But twelve more? Isn't that a lot? Does Shirou get killed by  that many times?

Yeah, he will.

The chance of Shirou's death is highest in this route.
And it's in bad taste too. In contrast to the splatter-like deaths you cause, this route is more horrifying.

Wow. The one's character is displayed.

Yeah. So you be careful in your choices, okay, Shirou?
This dead end is, um... it's because you tried to fight by yourself even though Saber-chan's gone.

That's no good, Shirou. Your opponents are all monsters, so you have to team up with a monster you can use as a shield.

I know you don't want to, but go back to the choice and ask Rin.

And be careful with the choice after that. I don't know about a man doing everything he is told to do.

That's exactly right, master! Be able to say no!

Shirou with great determination!

That's right.

Then let's meet again in the next Tiger Dojo!
The 9th day has four Tiger Dojos, so be careful in your choices!

See ya!
...Um, it's the Tiger Dojo, but... isn't it a bit strange this time?

Osu, that's not true.
It's the normal, peaceful and fun Tiger Dojo!

Uh, I feel murderous intent again... No, this isn't just my imagination. I think something bad is glaring at me.

Well, this dead end is your usual abrupt death!

Once you see Rider's eyes, you can't get away from her mystic eyes. It's smarter to go into defense rather than trying to attack.

Wait! Hold on! Something is weird, there's someone behind me! But I'm too scared to turn around and look!

Hmm, but Shirou sure does die in bizarre ways.
It's rare even in our world to die of petrification.

It's near me! The rare death is right near me!
Why do I deserve this!?

Why? It's because Sakura's the type to bear grudges.

Don't you remember saying it before, Taiga? You said Rider's Master is a twisted snake woman.

Whoa, maybe I did say something like that...

Whoa!
Heeeelp meeee, soooomeone!

Well, the Tiger Dojo is over!

You reap what you sow.
Be careful about talking behind people's backs!
...Hmm, I can't say much this time.
This is one result.

........................................................................Idiot.

Hey there, don't complain!
This Tiger Dojo is cancelled! We'll wait for you in another Tiger Dojo!
Heartless collection! The evil bill collector!

Osu! Heading straight for the underground kingdom after carelessly signing a contract!

Yeah. Man, these contracts sure are scary.
They pull your leg when it counts, even when you don't mean it.

Don't get tricked by such sales, okay, everyone?
The scariest things are always right next to you where you don't expect them.

Right, Ilya-chan!?

...? Stop it, that's embarrassing.
I don't know why, but I feel bashful if you stare at me so much.

See, isn't she scary?
So, the cause of this death is your contract with Tohsaka-san.

She makes unreasonable demands of you, but there is one thing you should not say "yes" to.
Try starting over from the beginning of day 9.

Osu! And I also hear that her affection point goes up if you go against one of her questions!

Oh, as expected from the heroine (candidate) returning from the main storyline!
You have awesome information.

Ugh... I thought we promised not to say that...

Well, this is the last Tiger Dojo in day 9.

What lies ahead is a hell filled with dead ends!
Face the battles with care!

See ya!

"Phew."
I put down the empty bowl.
But the side dishes are still untouched.
It was all I could do to finish the rice and miso soup.  I don't even want to think about eating anything else.

But it can't be helped. Forgive me, Sakura.
I want to get away from here and give myself a chance to calm down.

"...Senpai. Um, did you not like the breakfast today?"
"Ugh."
Strategic retreat, failed.
It seems I'm the only one who didn't notice that there is no escape.

"......"
I hand her the bowl silently.

"Oh, seconds!? I made a lot, so please eat up."
...I take the refilled bowl and resume breakfast.


...I guess it can't be helped. I'll prepare myself.
I'll just have to deal with the fact that I'm blushing, and I won't make excuses for looking at every move Sakura makes.

But still...
"Sakura. Isn't she a problem?"

"...? What do you mean by that, Senpai?"
She looks at me in wonder.
In other words...
It seems that the presence of Rider sitting silently next to her doesn't bother Sakura at all.

"Well, by problem..."
I take a look at Rider.
She must have realized she's out of place.
"You do not need to worry about me. Please go ahead and eat."
Her elegance is a match for Sakura's.

"Huh? Were you feeling uneasy because of her, Senpai?"
"It seems so. We fought several times, after all.
 I am sure having your bitter enemy at the table with you is uncomfortable."

"That's not true. Senpai doesn't hold a grudge against you."

...This is troubling.
I don't have a grudge against her, but she has a rank of A+ in terms of people I cannot get along with.

"...What shall I do?
 It seems he is not eating much because of me. I can leave if I am annoying him."
"I'm saying that's not true! Right, Senpai? You don't mind even if Rider's here, right?"

"......"
I'm troubled.
I'm troubled, so
"...All right. I'll be honest.
 But I want to tell you beforehand that I'm not good at flattery or pretty words, so I'd be grateful if you took that into consideration."

I stare at Rider.
I can't imagine what she's thinking, but it seems she knows I'm serious.

"I'll tell you clearly. I don't have a grudge against you. I don't have a problem with eating with you. Even though I find you hard to deal with, I do like you, Rider."
I tell her straight, fighting down my nervousness.

"Impossible. Are you not afraid of me?"

"Well, you are scary, but you're on our side now, right?
 You've saved me once, and you fought to protect Sakura at school. There's no way I can hate you. ...But like I said, it is a bit tough to deal with you."

"...I do not understand, but you do not seem to be lying. ...Let me ask again. You are not scared of me?"

"I said I am scared of you. I'm fully aware how scary a Servant you are.
 ...But you're good on the inside, and you're really similar to Sakura. So I can trust you, and I want you to keep protecting Sakura, even if you do make me a little uncomfortable."

Ugh... It feels like I'm confessing my love to her.
She might ask me again if I keep looking at her, so I'll turn away and evade the
......Wait.
Crap, what am I saying in front of Sakura...!?

"Sakura. You're mistaken. This is about if I like her or not, it has nothing to do with..."
"I don't care! Well, I now know that you're a cheater who'll fall for anyone with a pretty face!"

"Mm."
Wow.
Is this the first time I've seen her this angry?

"Wait, Sakura. Calm down. I just like Rider as a person, not a woman. You trust her too, right? It's just like that.
 First of all, you say she's beautiful, but you're more beautiful to me. Compared to you, Sakura, Rider is just..."

Wait... I-I just felt hostility from Rider...!

"Um, she's equally beautiful, so I don't think we should be comparing who is more beautiful."
...This is bad.
I feel like I'm hastening the inevitable with each word I speak.

"Let's stop. This isn't an appropriate conversation for a meal. I propose that we start talking about something else."
I raise both my hands and appeal.
You could also interpret it as surrender.

"No, we're not done yet. This is a good opportunity to learn how you truly feel."
"I agree with Sakura. This is a small matter for me, but we should make things clear."
They both lean forward.

"Senpai. Which one of us do you prefer?
 We're talking about your feelings, so you should know the answer."
Uh.

"Sakura is right. Though it is unimportant, I am curious about your answer."
Ugh.

Please tell us.
I feel my back touch the wall behind me.
There's no retreat, and I'm going to make one of them mad the instant I open my mouth.

"Uh... guh."
But the problem isn't an instantaneous one.
This problem I've encountered will continue looming over me in the future.
...Sakura and Rider.
Maybe it's just women's sense of solidarity, but they sure are alike...
...I hesitate to say it, but it's true.
We're going to be together, so I should be forthright with them now to prevent misunderstandings.

"...I'm sorry, but to be honest, I find her hard to deal with. It's not that I hate her, but I get nervous when she's around."
The air becomes heavy.
...Sakura was being considerate, but this only worsens our discord

"You need not be troubled, Sakura. His reaction is normal."
"Eh... no, you're wrong, Rider. Senpai is just not used to you for now, so..."

"I do not mind. His current reaction is preferable. He is stating the truth.
 ...Yes. It seems he cannot lie, just as you said."


I'm surprised.
Rider can smile kindly like that?

"Emiya Shirou. Let me ask you again. You hold no ill will towards me?"
"No. You make me uncomfortable, but I certainly don't hate you."

"That is fine. Please maintain that stance.
 I am Sakura's Servant. Sakura's safety is always my priority, and circumstances may require me to attack you again. It is for both our benefit to be on guard against each other."

"R-Rider...! Please stop. Senpai is important to me, so don't say it like that...!"
"...You're right. I shall withdraw my comment about attacking you.
 We shall cooperate for as long as you protect Sakura. Please give me your best regards."
Rider bows politely.


I understand her point.
I don't know when she might become my enemy again, but I feel her determination to protect Sakura.

"All right. Let's do our best."
"Yes. That should please Sakura as well. I shall stay in the shadows, so you can protect Sakura in the light."
Rider speaks plainly.
The conversation ends there, and we resume breakfast in the strange atmosphere.
...Hm.
To be honest, I can't quite figure out how to deal with her.
But I already know Rider is my ally.
The reason I can't calm down is not that Rider is here, it's that

"Aren't you going to eat, Rider? Isn't it hard for you to just sit there when we're both eating?"
Um, I feel bad because it feels like I'm forcing Rider to fast.

"I will not eat."
S-She's mad for some reason.
"Why? Servants get hungry too, don't they? Saber ate a lot, even though she didn't say much."

"She is different from us. I am not interested in how humans consume nutrition. Andyour manners do not suit me."

"Oh. You should've said so if you can't use chopsticks."
"Eh, Senpai?"
"Hold on. I'm going to go get dishes and a spoon for Rider."

"...! Yes, then I'll make an omelet. That'll be quick, right?"
"Sakura."

"It's all right. This is your first time eating, right? You're going to be doing a lot of things for me, so please let me do at least this much."
Sakura happily says this and comes into the kitchen.

"Oh, how about we make some soup while we're at it? We still have some consomme, right?"
"Oh, that sounds good. We have some tomatoes, so let's make this in a flash!"

...Sakura starts to cook for Rider.
Rider watches Sakura as she happily starts cooking.
Breakfast is over, and it's now nine o'clock.
I skipped school today.
Things are getting serious, so I have no intention of going to school until the Holy Grail War ends.

My only reason to go to school was to meet Tohsaka.
Now that the reason is gone, there's no meaning in going outside, and most of all
It's too dangerous to have Sakura go outside.

"......"
Sakura's been looking healthy enough, but we don't know when she'll collapse like she did yesterday.
Although she recovered, thanks to Kotomine's treatment, she's walking a thin line.

...I don't know what Zouken intends to do, but I can't let Sakura meet him in her unstable condition.
If the crest worm is activated, it'll all be over.

Shinji did it using a drug.
But for Zouken, the one who put the crest worm there, it should be easy to activate just by looking at her.


Kotomine said it too.
That Sakura won't last long.
That I'm the only one who knows about this.
...I can't tell Sakura or Tohsaka.
I have to end the war before Sakura finds out what I'm doing.

I don't have the power to save Sakura.
But the Holy Grail, the thing that is said to grant any wish, should easily be able to save her.

"Senpai? You're making a scary face and acting strange. We skipped school, so I think we can relax..."

"No, we should rest after the war. We have to think about how to win now."
"...Senpai. You still want to continue?"
I'm taken aback by her uneasy tone.

"......"
...I vaguely understood, but Sakura doesn't want to fight.
She should know the Holy Grail is the best way to cure her, but she's not even considering it.

...Hatred of battle.
Sakura is terrified of harming others.
She's right, and I have no intention of contradicting her.
Sakura can stay that way.
I'm the one who's made her cry all this time. Therefore, it's my job to fight for her.

"Yeah, I'm going to continue fighting. If we could talk it out, I'd do it, but we can't be saying that. I don't think Zouken will release you, and I'm sorry, but I can't give him the Holy Grail.
 ...There are four more Masters. I'm going to make you win and have you use the Holy Grail."

"...I'm happy to hear you say that. But... can you fight Tohsaka-Senpai?"
"I'll fight her if she gets in our way... Well, I really want to entrust her with something as dangerous as the Holy Grail. I'm sure she can manage it and save you as well."

"...Is... that so? She's a magus. I don't think she will think about someone as weak as me."


I can't say it's not true.
...Tohsaka is a nice person. I already know that.
But with that aside, Tohsaka is a magus.
Last night, she said she would kill Sakura.
Even though that might've been the only choice at the time, she was willing to take it.

...So.
If the Holy Grail turns out not to be able to save Sakura, she would surely use the Holy Grail, something far superior to Archer, to kill Sakura.

"...You're right. But still, Tohsaka won't be able to do it.
 She can't kill you."
"Eh...? Why do you think so, Senpai?"

"Well, I don't have any proof, but deep down she's an amazing person. I bet the future she chooses is a really happy one where nobody has to die. So it's fine.
 Tohsaka will surely save you in the end."

"...Um. So about Tohsaka-Senpai. You... um..."
"Hm?"
"...No, it's nothing. I'll believe in her if you say so."

"Yeah. Then again, it'd be a shame to put everything on her shoulders, and I don't want to just hand it to her in any case. I want to be the one protecting you."
I chose to lead Sakura's way, so I can't give that role to anyone else.
I'm going to do my best to make Sakura happy.

"...Um, Senpai. I appreciate your concern. But I don't think you're in a state to fight. Saber-san's gone, and you're enemies with Tohsaka-Senpai now.
 There's no need for you to involve yourself in the Holy Grail War. So please go back to your usual life.
 ...I don't want you getting hurt because of me."

"Idiot. That's not your fault. I'm doing it because I want to, and it's not something I can withdraw from now. You should know that too, Sakura."

I participated in this war as Saber's Master.
I didn't become a Master because I was dragged into it. I became a Master by choice.
ThenI can't withdraw now.

I'll fight, even if I have to do it alone.
I will see this conflict to its end.
...This is also my atonement for Saber, who lost her life fighting for my selfish goals.

"...Then no matter what, you will..."
"I won't stop. So I think we need to come up with a plan of action. Is that fine with you, Rider?"
"I do not mind. You are correct. What is your opinion, Sakura?"

"......"
Sakura agrees with silence.
...Good, it seems she understands.

"All right. We need a plan, but before that..."
I glance at Rider.
...I'm getting used to her presence, but I want to do something about this.

"What is it?"
"It's about your eyes. Why don't you take off your blindfold when you're in the house?
 I know about your mystic eyes, so you don't need to hide them, right?"
Isn't it uncomfortable?

"...So my beauty is being spoiled by its appearance?"
"To be frank, yes. Your clothes may be fine, but isn't it hard to keep that blindfold on? You're beautiful, so why don't you take off that sultry thing?"
"That is what he says, Master. I shall consider it, depending on what you say."

"No!
 Absolutely not!!"

"Huh?"
 ...Wait.
Why is Sakura objecting so desperately?

"Why? Doesn't it trouble you to have Rider walking around blindfolded?"

"N-not at all! First of all, she has mystic eyes. What would you do if you're affected by them on accident?"
"Hm. Would such a thing ever happen, Rider?"

"Yes. My eyes are more like evil eyes.
 It would be difficult to keep from targeting you even if I saved my magical energy."
"Whoa, are you serious? You can't control your own eyes?"

"No. Hence my title.
 ...But I cannot hope for an effect equaling yesterday. You now know that my eyes are mystic eyes of petrification. This recognition weakens the effect that a surprise attack has, so you should petrify at a slower rate."

"I see. So my body won't suddenly go numb like yesterday?"
"It would depend on the situation. The effect will be magnified if you let your guard down."

"Hm. So I just have to not let my guard down, right? Then there's no problem. Even if I'm captivated, you're on my side, so you can dispel me right away."

"Yes. I will not take your life. In that regard, there is no danger."
"No, no, I said no...! Rider's eyes aren't just to petrify others!"

"You are right. Then I shall keep them sealed."
Sakura lets out a sigh of relief.

"......?"
...Hm.
I don't really understand, but it seems Rider's going to keep her blindfold on.

"...I see. It bothers me, but if that's what you want, I'll have to deal with it."
"Yes, I do not like revealing my face. Please do not bring this up again."

Where did her previous lightheartedness go? Rider is suddenly acting cold now.
...She's hard to understand.
I guess I just can't get along with her all that well.
And she is left alone.
There is no reason for the boy to fight.
The one who is no longer a Master walks into danger while she, the danger's cause, is resting.
That fact depresses her even more.

"He has headed to the forest. Do you regret it, Sakura?"
The servant asks her master.
The girl does not nod, but narrows her eyes and shakes her head once.

"...I can't regret it, Rider. There's no point now."
"You are correct. That was certainly a meaningless question."
"Yes. But it's not all painful. I know it's wrong to say this, but I'm happy. I'm happy that Senpai's doing something for me."
But her face is filled with agony.
The mouth that says she's happy is heavy as if bound by a feeling of guilt.

"But that's wrong. Grandfather will show no mercy. As long as Senpai keeps fighting, there's a chance that he'll die.
 And most of all"
It's troubling for her if he stays in the war any longer.
It will bring a bad fate down upon them both.

That's why she wants him to simply return to his normal life.
She will not last long.
That being the case, she wants him to live.
...But...
At the same time, she clings to hope.
For as long as he fights, she can be with him.
No, it delights her that the person she loves is fighting and getting hurt for her sake.

She doesn't want him to fight.
But having him fight makes her happy.
The two contradictory wishes compete for control within her.

"...What a lie. It's not competing at all."
With a pained murmur, she acknowledges the darkness within her.
Yes.
She wants him to fight. She wants him to save her. She wants him to answer her to make up for all the times he did not.
For that reasonhe can get hurt.
And she thinks about something she shouldn't.

"Hah, kuh......!"
She clutches her chest.
As if responding to her dark passions, the worm within her stirs against her nerves.
...It was only for an instant.
She imagined him getting hurt for a mere instant, and the worm has begun to violate her once again.

Wriggle, wriggle.
Wriggle, wriggle.
Wriggle, wriggle, wriggle.
The squirming in her body makes her ears ring.
It melts into her blood, causing a chill to run through her body.
The feeling stimulates her, and she thinks her body is lewd and evil.
...The worm that melted into her blood becomes aphrodisiac, heating up her body.
The waves threaten to wash her consciousness away.
She always thinks with her heated head.

That her limbs are too dirtied to be called human limbs.
Sexual desire easily fills her body, and she clings on the ground in a vulgar manner.
Her panting does not stop, and her hips wriggle like mucus.
It is no different from the thing entangling her nerves.
The worm violates her the more she tries to deny it, her consciousness is melted away, and...
She feels like she is a worm herself.
And in the end, an ominous feeling dominates her whole body.

"Sakura."
"...It's fine. I'm still all right. More importantly, Rider. Please go with Senpai."
"...I shall obey if that is an order. But Sakura. You do not have long to live either. To use me is to shorten your remaining life. Is that fine with you?"

"...Yes. I won't last long anyway.
 I'm fine now, but I lose track of what I'm doing if I let my guard down. ...My memory becomes more vague by the day, and I can't feel anything in my limbs anymore. Even my sense of time is going, so that a day doesn't flow properly for me.
 ...Like today. It feels like it's been a week since I saw Senpai off."

She says it as if it's nothing.
...She has accepted death.
She's fighting the ugliness of clinging to hope, and she has ordered her to protect him.

"Understood. I shall obey my master and guard Emiya Shirou."
"Thank you. ...I'm sorry, Rider. If I'm no good anymore, then go make a contract with someone else. I don't want Senpai... but maybe it's okay if it's with you."
She forces a smile.
The Servant in black nods and turns her back to her master.

"...An ill wind blows. I will be using my Noble Phantasm. Is that permissible?"
"Yes. Please bring Senpai back if things turn out to be dangerous."
"I know. But Sakura.
 I believe we should be on guard against that priest over the old man."
Rider speaks without looking back.


That's a surprise for her.
This Servant does not state her opinions. She silently does as she is told.
She has never shown concern for her the way she does now.

"Yeah. I think so too."
She murmurs as if singing.
Her grief dispelled, she is now filled with languorous elegance.
"But don't worry, Rider.
 He can't beat me."
She smiles like a girl picking flowers.

...I open my eyes.
While staring up at the ceiling, I raise my arm and let it fall to the futon.

"It's a bit heavy."
I keep my eyes on the ceiling in a daze, not bothering to get up.
...My body feels dull.
I'm not awake yet, and I feel like I need more rest.
Even though it's morning already, I really don't feel like getting up.

"Hm... Why am I so tired?"
I try to recall what happened.
Then.


At the very least, my sleepiness is blown away in an instant.

"Um."
I look beside me.
No one is beside me. All I see is my lazy arm.

"Oh, so Sakura's already awake."
Then she should be in the kitchen.
Knowing her, I bet she's preparing breakfast and letting me sleep in.

"Man, she always pushes herself if I don't stop her."
I raise myself up.
Immediately, dizziness assails me.

"...Whoa. My body sure feels heavy."
Maybe I'm tired.
A lot certainly did happen yesterday, but, um... I don't think what happened last night would make me this tired.
I haven't been training for nothing.
It must be because I didn't get that much sleep.

"...I couldn't sleep really well. Well, my blood should get flowing once I start moving around."
First of all, Sakura's in a worse state.
And she's pushing herself even harder, so I can't be resting just because I feel a bit tired.

Mustering my resolve, I get out from the futon.
"Ugh."
And I get dizzy again.
It's not because of fatigue.
It's because, um, my appearance is very unique, causing me to remember what happened last night.

"......Um. I have to put some clothes on."
I drag the futon with me as I make my way to the wardrobe.
...Crap.
If this is causing me to blush, how in the hell can I greet Sakura...?

"Phew."
I take another deep breath to prepare myself.


It's all right. I've simulated it many times in my head.
It's nothing difficult. I've greeted her numerous times before, so it's weird to be nervous.

"All right, I'm going."
I put gasoline into my empty tank.
I turn the key, kick the gas pedal, and enter the living room where Sakura is.

Oh.
Then.
Sakura, who I thought would still be in the kitchen, is in the living room, putting breakfast on the table.

"Uhg-g-good morning, Senpai."
"UhYeah. G-Good morning, Sakura."
We both greet each other with tense voices.

"Um......... well."
"Uh......... um."
I try to say something, but my head is blank.



This is bad.
It's bad to have silence so early in the morning... no, more than that, as a man, I can't trouble a girl...!

"G-Good morning, Sakura...! The food sure looks good!"
I talk stupidly.
...Wait, this greeting isn't any different from the earlier one, you idiot!

"Oh, yes! G-Good morning, Senpai!"

...Um.
I think Sakura's response is the same as well.

She looks at me in surprise, evidently thinking the same thing.
To her, I must look the same way.

"Hah."
Thinking about it makes me relax.
We were both nervous, but we were looking forward to seeing each other.

"...Phew. This is the third time, but good morning, Sakura."
I give a natural smile and greet her again.
The instant she sees me relax...
"Yes. Good morning, Senpai."
Sakura returns the smile and responds for the third time.

And so our awkward breakfast starts.

"Itadakimasu."
"Yes, itadakimasu."
Even though we can do all the usual formalities, I'm still nervous.


I eat restlessly.
...Sakura must have gotten over it, as she's eating in a good mood.
...Hmm, are girls stronger in this regard?

"...? Is something wrong? Oh, do you want more miso soup?"
"No, I'm still on my first bowl. But it's good. Yeah, it's really good."
"Yes. I'm confident in today's food, so I'm glad you like it."

"!"
Her smile makes me choke.
It's embarrassing to be blushing when Sakura's already composed, so I start eating to hide it.
"Let's get back on topic. About our future course of action... First of all, you're not to go out of this house, Sakura. It's too dangerous for you to meet Zouken. I'll handle him."

"That is a proper approach. But how will you defeat that magus? Do you have any thoughts?"

...I hesitate to answer if she asks me like that.
There are several possibilities, but I haven't put any thought into them.

"That's"
...The choice will likely determine our fate.
There are many choices.
Of them all, the most realistic and reliable method would be...

"I think I should cooperate with another Master.
 She may not become our ally, but she may help us defeat Zouken if we tell her about the current situation."

"Another Master... Do you mean Tohsaka-Senpai?"
"Eh? No, it's not Tohsaka. I know Berserker's Master. Her name's Ilya, and I know she'll listen to me if I go to her and talk."

...And to be honest, I can't leave her all by herself.
Leaving Tohsaka aside, I don't know what Zouken will do.
He's the kind of guy that would implant a worm in Sakura and force her to fight.
Ilya and Berserker should be many times stronger than Zouken in combat, but we're talking about that monster. I'm sure he will use any means possible precisely because he can't beat them in combat.
So even those two should be careful.

"Berserker... You believe that mad warrior will become our ally?"
"They may not become our ally, but they should at least overlook us for a while. And even if we can't cooperate, I want to warn them at the very least."

The girl that came to this town alone.
Ilya was raised as a Master and crowned with the name Einzbern, so she's not a total stranger to me.

"...I see. But Senpai, do you know where this Ilya person is?"
"Yeah, she showed me once before. I remember the way. It's a big forest, so I don't think it'll go exactly as planned, but I should make it in half a day."

"Half a day... That means you're going to set out now?"
"Yeah. They say to strike while the iron's hot, and if I head out now, I should be back by nightfall."

I was pressed to make a decision, but this is good.
Ilya helped me yesterday, so I want to thank her for that.

...And.
It might prove fatal for her if I don't tell her about Matou Zouken and that mysterious shadow.

"I'm gonna get going. I'll come back as quickly as possible, so you rest in your room."
"Okay, Senpai. Then please, at least take Rider with you. She can protect you from anything that might happen."

"Oh, yeah. That's safer for me."
...But I can't agree to that.
Sakura is also in danger.
No, she's in greater danger because she can't oppose Zouken if she meets him.

"No, you protect Sakura, Rider.
 If Zouken comes, try to avoid battle since that uses your magical energy. Instead, carry Sakura and run away. I'm sure they can't catch up to you."

Rider nods obediently, apparently thinking the same thing.

"See, Rider's saying the same thing. You'll be staying home for today."
"......But it's dangerous for you too. That forest right now is..."
"Don't worry. I'll run away if I think it's dangerous. And Ilya isn't interested in anyone that's not a Master. It's not dangerous for me since I'm not a Master anymore."

I pat her on the shoulder and leave the living room.
Well.
I'll go to the shed first and find something I can use as a weapon.

Sakura sees me off as I go.
A shinai bag with two wooden swords inside and another bag filled with light food are the only things I'm carrying.
I didn't bring a map or a compass.
It's a route Ilya showed me with her magic. So all I can rely on is my memory and my instinct.

"...It's before ten. An hour on the taxi, and four hours on foot..."
I hope that's all the time it'll take.

I'll ask the taxi driver to go slow and find the entrance to the forest.
I'll get off the taxi when I find the entrance, and continue on foot from there.
I'll make it to Ilya's castle before sunset if I take the shortest route.
I'll figure out what to do next once I've met Ilya.

"Shirou."
"Huh?"
...Then.
I hear a familiar voice from behind me.
It sounds practical, and cold depending on how you hear it.
But my name is said politely, with as much intimacy as she can show.

"Sab..."
I almost say the name, voicing my impossible wish.
"Wait. I must speak with you before you leave."

"Ri... der."
I turn around and accept reality.
Rider is in front of me.
The girl who used to call me with that tone is no longer in this world.

"Fine, but what is it? I'm in a hurry, so please make it short."
"I only have one question. You said you will protect Sakura. But I have not heard your reasons for doing so, Emiya Shirou."

"Are you saying you can't trust me?"
"Correct. I do not know you as well as Sakura does."
"......"

That's a natural question.
Rider protects Sakura, not me.
As a potential ally, she just wants to know my intentions.

"......Phew. I'll only say this once, so don't ask me about this again. It's not that I'm putting undue importance on it. It's just not something to go around telling people."
"........."

"Look. I like Sakura. Not only that.
 I had sex with her last night."
"...It seems so. Sakura's magical energy was stable this morning. Sakura would have been sick again if she did not get outside provision.
 What of it?"

"That's all. I like Sakura, and I made love to her. That's the only reason I'm protecting her. It's natural for a man to protect his woman, right?"


"...Then you are fighting for Sakura? Your goal is to save Sakura. You have no intention of letting her obtain the Holy Grail for your benefit?"

"Well, I am planning to use it. I don't know what the Holy Grail is, but if it can bring Sakura happiness, I'm going to make full use of it."
"Bring Sakura happiness?"
"Yeah. I've made Sakura suffer until now. So I want to compensate for that by making her happy."

Rider just stands there without saying anything.
...It seems she understands why I'm embarrassed to tell people about this.

"All right. I answered your question, so it's my turn. I have a request to ask of you."
"O-Okay, I shall answer it to the best of my ability."

"It's easy. Can you not say my name with that accent you just used? Can you pronounce it properly? It's Shirou. Don't drop the 'u' and pronounce it clearly."

"...? ...I-I understand. Shirou is fine?"
"That still sounds weird. You don't have to put any unusual accents on it."
"Um, S-Shirou. Shirou. Shirou. Shirou, no, Shirou."

Rider struggles as she practices pronouncing my name.
......Yeah.
She has a sharp image because of her blindfold and her black clothing, but Rider is actually sociable.
I'm just guessing, but I think Rider is a klutz in her private life.

"Shirou. ...Hm, so is this the correct pronunciation, Shirou?"
"Yeah, it's perfect. I'm sorry I asked you a selfish request."

"Selfish...? You did not like to be called with the accent I used, right? Then I believe it is right for you to correct me."
"You're wrong. I did like the way you called me."

...That's right.
I liked it, so I don't want anyone else saying it the same way.
I know it's a stupid thing to care about, but she was the only one I wanted to hear call me like that.

"I'm sorry. It's really just something selfish. It's not that you're at fault."
"I understand. I shall not inquire about it if you say so."
"Okay, then I'm going. I'm leaving Sakura to you, Rider!"

I wave to Rider and start running.
I'll go to the intersection and catch a cab.
Then I'll go to the suburbs and look for the forest entrance that I only saw once.
A few minutes' walk from the national highway.
Even though I've never seen it in person, the forest's entrance looks familiar.  It's white like morning mist, even during the day.
The dim sunlight and fog steal the sense of time from this place.

"...Whoa. Am I really going to be fine?"
I can't believe how reckless I'm being.
I didn't get lost back then because I was watching it through Ilya, but this isn't something I can manage by memory alone.

"No, I can whine later. I'm desperate, so I just have to go tackle this."
I put spirit in myself as I put the bag over my shoulder.

It's past noon.
It takes about four hours to reach Ilya's castle from here, according to what I saw.
All I can rely on now are my physical strength, memory, and recollection skills

I walk through the forest.
The smell of sap is a bit suffocating.
The unpaved path is tiring to walk on.

It's been two hours, and I think I'm following the route Ilya showed me.
But it's worrying that there's no sign to confirm that I'm on track.

I can keep walking all day because of my training, but mental fatigue is chipping away at my energy.
If memory serves, I still have two hours to go.
I can easily imagine what'll happen if I don't end up at the castle in that time.
My physical limit is far, but I'll make trivial mistakes with a disturbed mind.

Rehydration and monitoring your condition are your highest priorities during mountain climbing, and you have to worry about which foot you step with and the depth of the bare rock you're scaling.

Even though the forest isn't as dangerous as a mountain, this place has a different kind of danger.
Losing your sense of direction, not knowing where you are...
There's the danger of getting lost, and who knows what beasts you might encounter.

The beasts living in this vast forest are likely to have their territories.
When people stray into those territories, they're usually attacked.

Walking aimlessly is like asking to be attacked, and even a straight animal trail needs to be avoided from time to time.
Fortunately, snakes don't seem to exist in this forest.
All I see are traces of wild dogs, and that's rare too.

I bet there aren't many living things here because of the magic of Einzbern on this forest.
But there are a few wild dogs, and there may be far worse things.

"Oh, that way is bad. I'll have to watch out on my way home."

I go around the thicket that an animal may be lurking in and make my way according to my memory.
Discretion is the better part of valor.
It's a rule of thumb to simply avoid dangerous places rather than waiting until the danger confronts you and then running away.

"...But still... This forest seems different from the one Ilya showed me."

...The air around me feels different.
An ominous chill runs down my back with every step.
Don't go any further.
Get out of this forest now.
Nobody will return alive from this forest today.
I feel like the swaying trees are warning me.

"Come to think of it, this smell is..."
I thought it was sap, but that's not quite right.
...The sweet smell is nothing like the forest.
This is
Probably...

"Hold on."
I take out a wooden sword from my bag.
...I stop, concentrate, and strengthen it within a few minutes.

"Something's coming."
...I hear footsteps from the other side of the thicket.
I hear sounds among the swaying branches.


...It's coming.
It comes out and heads straight for me!

I raise my wooden sword.
Tensing my arms, I grip the sword and stand ready.

"That's it, don't move!"
"All right, don't move!"
We both freeze.

"......"
"......"
............Well.
How should I handle this situation?

"...Hey. Can you lower that? This isn't a haunted house, you know?"
...Tohsaka lowers her guard first.

"Oh, sorry."
I follow her example.

"...Hmph. What a strange place to run into you.
 I guess I'd better ask, but you're not just scouting sites for a picnic, are you?"
"Of course not. What about you? You're not the type to take walks in a forest. What are you planning?"

"How rude, I do too take walks in the forest. Well, my business today is different."
She protests.
The surprising part here is that she's not denying that she's planning something.

"Tohsaka. Are you planning to fight Ilya?"
I get right to the point.

"...What if I am? You're not a Master anymore. So you don't have the right or the duty to meddle with our battles."
"I don't. But I'll stop you if you're going to fight Ilya."

"Why? Are you planning to have Ilya join forces with Sakura?"
"That's part of the reason. But you won't come out unwounded if you fight Ilya. One of you will end up hurt if you two fight. I don't like that. First of all, I..."

"You decided to fight to stop the battles, right? I see you haven't changed your mind."
Her sharp tone gone, Tohsaka shrugs in resignation.

"......Oh."
That's Tohsaka's real face that she had on before that thing happened to Sakura.

"W-What? I can't change it so easily because it's something I decided on."

"I figured as much. Geez, I've suspected this for a while now, but..."
I don't know why.
But Tohsaka gives an exaggerated sigh...
"You're really stupid, aren't you, Emiya-kun?"
...And gives a smile that surprises even me.

"Wha"
"But this is good. You never learn your lesson, but that's what I expect from you. You should do your best as a clumsy person."

"W-What's with that triumphant expression!? You piss me off!"

"Now, now. So I guess you have business with Ilya too. You're really planning to talk with her?"
I'm angry, but Tohsaka just stares at me with a smile.

"Hm"
...Damn.
I don't know why, but I can never deal with Tohsaka in these situations. I feel like I'll back myself further into a corner no matter what I say.

"...? Why are you quiet all of a sudden? It's not like you."
"......Heh. Yeah, you're exactly right. I'm going to see Ilya, so don't bother me. I'll chase you away if you come following me."

"Huh? Oh, you know where Ilyasviel lives?"
"Oh."
Crap.
Me and my big mouth.

"Good, can you lead me there?
 I know the general location, but I only have a really old map, and I can't really trust it. It's great if you know where it is."
"Hey now. I told you not to follow me."

"Oh. Can you let me be when you're going to go talk to Ilyasviel? If I find her first, she'll be too busy to talk with you."

"...! A-Are you threatening me!?
 First of all, you're going to fight her even if we go together, right!?"

"I won't. It's best if we can cooperate with her. Our priority is to kill Zouken, right? I came here to warn her."
"! Warn her about what?"

"Matou Zouken is planning something, so I'm going to warn her not to let her guard down. You remember what happened to Caster, right? It'll be to our disadvantage if the same thing happens to Berserker.
 But I was ready to fight her even though I only came to warn her. Considering us, we can't just talk.
 I thought it can't be helped if we ended up fighting after I warned her. I have to beat her eventually, so this is just a matter of time, right?"

"But you seem to have expectations. Then I don't need to take risks, and things can end peacefully depending on your efforts."


"Hey, don't make a difficult expression! I'll go back without doing anything if you can persuade Ilyasviel.
 But if you fail, we can beat her together or I'll help so that we can both escape. How about it? It's not a bad deal, right?"

"...Deal or not, you're going to follow me anyway, right?"
"Of course not, that's a false accusation. We just happen to be heading in the same direction."

"......"
She's a devil.
But she'll listen to me, so long as I'm guiding her.
Tohsaka will go fight Ilya if I leave her be, but she'll stay quiet if I take her with me.

"I'm not too sure about the way either, okay?
 Don't complain if we get lost."
"You don't need to worry. You're heading exactly the way my map says. We won't get lost with your guide and my map."


I sigh loudly, making sure Tohsaka can hear it.

"All right, I give up. Let's go to the castle together. You won't fight Ilya, right?"
"Right, I won't interfere while you're talking with her. She's troublesome if she's your enemy, but she's reliable if she's"

"An earthquake...!?"
The trees shake.
I hear explosions in the distance.
...No.
This isn't an earthquake. Something like a typhoon is raging nearby

"Tohsaka, this is...!"
"Berserker. I guess we were a bit too late."

"Wha... Then Berserker's the one raging around!?"
"Yes. We're here, so there's only one person Berserker would be fighting against. ...What will you do? I'm going, but will you stay?"

There's no time to think.
I...
"I'll go too. That's what I came here for."
"Then stay behind me. I'll let Archer lead the way. That way you won't get cut down the moment we get there."

Tohsaka starts running.
Archer takes form, gives me a single glance, and takes the lead.

"Please be all right, Ilya......!"
I clench the wooden sword in my hand and run after them at full speed.
...I can't act carelessly.
It's dangerous to make a move before I know what I'm getting into.

"I'll stay here. Are you really going to go, Tohsaka...?"
"Yeah. But you're making the right choice. I have Archer, but you're alone.
 It's good to be careful."

"...All right. Don't let your guard down, even with Archer, okay?"
"Of course. I'll come back right away if I think it's dangerous."

Tohsaka starts running without turning around.
...The tremors continue.
Tohsaka said Berserker is fighting.
Zouken and Assassin are the only other enemies.
Berserker will not lose in pure fighting ability.
Those two cannot beat him, no matter what tricks they pull.
Butwasn't that the case against Saber as well?


...I have a bad feeling. I feel like I'm making the same mistake again

"!?"
Darkness falls.
It's not because the light has been blocked.
My retinas are seared by black light, as if I've looked directly into the sun.

"What?"
My mind, filled with ominous presentiment, is filled with a different kind of uneasiness.
A complete darkness in which I have no sense of direction.
It feels as if I'm swallowed into "nothingness".

"......No way......!"
I fumble my way through the dark forest with my smashed vision.
Bam, crash.
I hit trees as I randomly walk on.

"Haa... Haa, haa, ha, ah......!"
I clumsily charge forward.
I feel blood on my shoulder.
My forehead's been gashed open where I hit it.
But I still want something definite.
Running into things and injuring myself is vastly preferable to having "nothing".

"HaHaa, ha, ha."
It's fine.
It's fine. My eyes just broke down because of the sudden light.
The forest is still there, and I still feel the ground beneath my feet.
It's just that my vision has gone black.
But it should go away in time.

...Only a bit longer until my vision returns.
I'm worried what that light was and if Tohsaka's all right, but I'm only going to pull her leg if I go to her with my eyes like this.
I have to concentrate on getting my vision back and escaping this darkness.

......
............
..................
........................
..............................Just a bit longer.
My vision should return soon.
I'm not worried about that.
My vision will return. That's a definite fact.


I'm just worried about the sounds around me.
The storm has stopped before I knew it.
I don't hear any crashing sounds, either.
Is there a reason that I'm not hitting trees anymore...?

"Just a bit more. Just a bit more."
The darkness will disappear soon.
I have to wait in this darkness until then.
I'll concentrate on that for now.
I can think later about why the sensation of the forest is gone.
I can also think later about the fact that my vision has already returned.

"......That's right. I have to escape this darkness"
I walk through the darkness, feeling nothing.
...Even though I know I'm in a forest, when it's this dark, I start to get bad ideas.

For example...
Like a ridiculous joke that...
I'm trapped in a world of shadows without an exit.

"HaHaha, ha"

I keep walking, bitterly laughing at my stupid thought.
I feel nothing.
But it's just a bit longer.
A bit longer.
A bit longer.
A bit longer.
A bit longer, and my vision should return, and the original scene will be back in front of me
We run through the forest.
In front of me is Tohsaka, leading the way.
Behind us is Assassin, pursuing us through the trees.

"Behind you, Emiya-kun...!"
She must be worried about us. Even though she could've escaped by now, she slows down and turns to look at us.

"......!"
I know that the enemy is right behind us.
But I can't shake him off.
Servant Assassin is after us.
There's no way I can shake him off when I have Ilya with

"That is far enough.  There is no need for you."

"What...?"
I hear an ominous voice right by my ear.
When I look to my side...

I see a white death's head, smiling as he licks the dagger.

"Guh!?"
The masked figure is knocked away.
While running beside me, Assassin was thrown off-guard by a kick to the side.

"...Hah. So you cannot even kill a kid unless you attack him by surprise, you third-rate?"
Archer does not slacken his pace as he talks.

"I will take the rear. You take Ilya and run.
 Hurry. We'll all die if that thing catches up to us."
Archer is looking at Assassin and something else that is coming from behind him.


...It's after us.
That shadow is coming after us while staining the ground black!

"What is that, Archer...!?"
"We can talk later. Run, kid. You took Ilya's hand, so protect her until the very end."

Archer slows down a bit and goes behind us.
...At that instant.
Right before he leaves, he gives Ilya a look heavy with regret.

I go through the forest with the sound of clashing swords at my back.
As Assassin follows, he is obstructed by Archer's efforts.

"Nu, guh"
Unable to sustain the offensive, Assassin is once again forced to retreat.
Their attacks are matched.
Even the daggers thrown at me are shot down, and it's obvious that Assassin is not in control of the fight.
But it's not because Assassin is weak.

"Hah!"
Archer repels the multitude of daggers.
His vigor is incomparable to before.
The scales of victory are tipping towards Archer.
I don't know why, but he is as strong as a fierce god right now.

"Nuhow can you still move...!?"
With even his strongest attack repelled, Assassin raises his voice as he retreats.
In response...

"It's simple. I'm not a respectable hero like the others. A heroic spirit that is not pure is no different from that mud.
 In other words"
Archer must consider it his chance of victory, as Archer charges.
"Although it is not to your degree, I am a distorted heroic spirit as well......!"
He cuts the white skull with one blow.

"Gi!"
The black cloak scatters in all directions.
Assassin retreats, clutching at his broken mask.

It is not a retreat to regroup, but a retreat to save his life.
The black Servant runs away from Archer and disappears into the trees.

"Nice job...! We don't have to worry about getting overtaken now...!"

"Thanks for the hard work, Archer. You're tired right? You can return to spirit form and rest."

Tohsaka looks relieved.
"Rin!"
Behind her...
"Toh-"
It appears, as if born from the trees' shadows.

"Huh, what?"
She looks behind her.
At the same time, the black shadow extends its tentacle and

"Toh... saka"
I won't make it even if I run.
I'll witness Tohsaka getting pierced by that black tentacle.

"Guh"
But the one I actually see impaled is Archer, who pushes Tohsaka aside.

"Huh......?"
Tohsaka looks up at Archer without comprehension.


It's the end for Archer.
He's still breathing, and he's not bleeding much.
It should be possible for him to heal himself even if he is pierced, as long as it's not fatal.
...But somehow, I understand that Archer cannot fight anymore.

...That thing kills Servants.
No matter how strong a heroic spirit one is, one cannot beat that black shadow as long as one is summoned as a Servant.
I vaguely comprehend that fact for some reason.

"No way... What... are you doing... Archer?"
...Tohsaka must have felt the same thing.
She calls to Archer with a trembling voice, stands up unsteadily, and
"Don't come...! Run away, you fool...!"
Archer's shout stops her cold.

The black shadow throbs.
The forest is dying.
All the magical energy here is being sucked by that shadow.


For some stupid reason, it reminds me of a water balloon.
It's like putting more water into an already-full balloon.
It's expanding beyond capacity, and I get the bad image of it explo

"Crap."
We'll get sucked up.
If we stay here, we'll be engulfed for sure.
...Archer pulls out the tentacle that pierced him and starts to run to Tohsaka.
Then I
I'll protect Ilya.
I can't try to save two people.
Tohsaka has Archer, but Ilya has no one.
Then...
I have to take Berserker's place!

"Get down, Ilya...!"
I tackle Ilya, forcing her to the ground.
And the instant I cover her body with my own...
My vision and perception is filled with black.

"Oh"

    It's hot.

My body is almost blown away.
The condensed and released wave of magical energy rages through the forest as a storm.

    It's not there.

My vision is painted black.
If it's this dark even though I can clearly see, a black sun must have come falling down.

    My body's not there.

It probably melted from the heat.
My body's not there.
The loss of my sense of touch is more disgusting than the pain.

"Haahah"
But that's a problem.
I can't protect Ilya unless I have a body.
The black shadow tries to take Ilya.
I flail my right arm to drive it off.
Embracing her with that same arm, I press her to the ground.

"Haah."
And I finally realize.
My body's there. My body must be there, or else I couldn't have protected Ilya.
...Man, I panicked too much.
All I lost was my left arm.
That's the only part of me that vanished without trace.  The rest of my body is still there.

...But I still have the sense of loss.
I only lost one of the two.
But it feels like I lost my whole body.


...It's disappearing.
The shadow fades away without trace, its energy spent.

...Ilya's safe.
My ears must be numb, as I can't hear what she's saying.

What... happened to Tohsaka?
Archer is... there.
His red cloak is painted a deeper red, and he's so weakened that he might disappear in the next second.

...How strange.
Why is she here?

"Have you gone mad? If you do such a thing, you will..."
"I do not even need to think about it. Two will disappear if I do nothing, but one can be saved if we transplant it.
 ...This body is almost dead anyway. If I am to disappear, it will not make a difference even if my arm is cut off."

Archer and Rider are talking.

...What the hell is going on?
And in the end...
"One would normally die. One cannot survive after attaching a spirit body to the human body. But the boy and I are an exception. Rin should treat him appropriately once she wakes up."
He tenderly runs his fingers through Tohsaka's hair.

My vision fades to black.
The dark sun no longer shines on the forest.
Then...
The darkness must be falling on my consciousness.
"So this is it. Farewell, Tohsaka."
Archer bids farewell in a voice that sounds just like mine.
Tohsaka is closer to the shadow than us.
Archer is dying, and Tohsaka, still in shock after his injury, cannot move.
Then I'm the only one who can bring her back...!

"Tohsaka!"
I let go of Ilya and run towards Tohsaka.
I'll still make it.
There are five meters to Tohsaka, and ten more to the shadow. If I run full-speed and pull her to the side, I'm sure I can manage something

And that thought proves to be a mistake.

The expanded shadow explodes in an instant.
I don't even have time to take her hand.
The shadow tramples over the forest under one breath.
And it mercilessly swallows the prey in its spider's web.

My temperature rises.
A fatal fever from the tropics drives my human body crazy.
There's no vaccine for it, but my body struggles to get away from the heat, and my mind abandons my body and dies first.

Without its soul, the flesh is easily swallowed.
As I melt into the black shadow...

  I think I hear the cry of an infant's birth.
In the end, Ilya will be coming to my house.
Tohsaka and Ilya leave the chapel, arguing.
I guess I can say they're getting along.


...Our conversation is over.
It's our problem now, so there's nothing to talk about with Kotomine.

I follow after them and leave the chapel.
But then...
"Do not forget, Emiya Shirou. That body of yours will no longer permit you to fight."
The priest gives his usual warning.

"That's not true. It's just that I can't use my left arm. I can still fight."
"I see. By the way, how is Matou Sakura's condition?"
"Sakura's condition...?"

...That's a bit unexpected.
I thought he was going to make more sarcastic remarks, so why is he suddenly concerned about how Sakura's doing?

"What's going on? What good would it do for you to care about Sakura?"

"It seems you do not understand. I am talking about your body.
 Look, Emiya Shirou. Your body is in critical condition, but Matou Sakura is carrying a more dangerous bomb. You will be safe if you do not fight, but she is breaking down with each passing second. That is why you cannot stop fighting, even though you know fighting will only bring you closer to death."

"........."
"Emiya Shirou has to fight if you are to save Matou Sakura. But now, fighting is like committing suicide for you.
 Thereforeyou must understand that saving Matou Sakura means killing yourself."

"......So what? That doesn't concern you at all."
I chose to save Sakura.
I won't back out on my oath, no matter what happens to my body.

"I see. A devotion to offer your life is beautiful.
 But is that woman truly so valuable to you?"
"What...?"

"This is your last warning, Emiya Shirou.
 To save a life is to satisfy one's desire.
 If you would like to keep Matou Sakura alivedo not forget this until the very end."

"......"
I go outside.
Tohsaka and Ilya are waiting for me there.
Ilya is looking up at the sky, and Tohsaka is glaring at me like she wants to complain.

"You're late! What were you talking with Kotomine about, Shirou?"
"Well, it was just his usual criticism"

More importantly, there's something that's on my mind, but I don't know if I should bring it up.
...Tohsaka.
Are you calling me by my first name now...?

"...Hmph, fine. We're short on time, so I'll get right to the point. This is a serious matter, and we don't have much chance of winning if we go our separate ways. I'll forgive you for what you did yesterday, so you'd better be grateful."

Her manner is pompous, but her words are even more so.
...Um, it's hard to understand, but what Tohsaka wants to say is...

"Tohsaka. Does that mean..."
"Yeah, I'm saying we can cooperate!
 First of all, you're unreliable. We're both out to defeat Zouken, so I can cooperate with you!"

Tohsaka continues angrily.

It feels like I'm hit in the head with a hammer.
The sudden request is a great fortune.

"OOh, thank you! I owe you, Tohsaka!
 There's no greater help than having you on my side...!"

I take Tohsaka's hand and shake it up and down.
This is troubling.
I know I'm being too happy, but I can't stop myself.

"Hey, I understand! You don't have to thank me, so hold on...!"
Tohsaka retreats quickly.
...Then.
I don't know why, but she looks at my left arm.

"...Let me ask you beforehand. You do know whose arm that is, right?"
"...?"
I nod, since it's a matter of course.

Tohsaka then takes a deep breath.
"Then you're my Servant from now on, Shirou.
 You were saved thanks to my Servant, so that's natural, right?"
...And makes a ridiculous demand.

"Wha"
"What?"
I'm really lost.
I try to figure out what Tohsaka means.

"W-What are you saying...!? It's stupid to claim his ownership just because of something like that!"
Yes.  Ilya can be reasonable, after all.

"First of all, you're completely missing the point. Shirou is mine, so there's no

 way he can be yours!"
...I see.
So she's missing the point too.

"Hey, you're the one talking big. Do you think Shirou is yours because you spared him once? Then that goes for me as well. I was so angry when I met him at school that I almost went berserk myself."

"That's just because you're immature. I spared him every day, so Shirou's life is obviously mine. I can choose to keep him alive or not, and you have nothing to do with this, so stay out of this."

"I have nothing to do with this...? Don't take me so lightly! I can't concern myself this much if I have nothing to do with this...!
 Archer entrusted me with him, so I'm going to take responsibility and make sure he stays alive!"

I can almost hear their teeth grinding as they glower at each other.
"......"
I wait for it to end.
...Well.
It's going to be troublesome, no matter who wins.

So, which one is it!?

It seems they've realized that fighting solves nothing, so they've chosen me to make the final decision.

"What do you mean 'which'?"
"So whose Servant are you? I haven't heard your answer yet, so it's best to clarify it now."

"Yeah. Rin doesn't seem to realize you don't want her, so you have to be clear.
 Come on, say it. You're mine, right?"

"......"
I don't need to think about it.
The one who has the right to order me around is
"It's Tohsaka. I don't even have to think about it."
"W-Why? Rin's oppressive, greedy, and loud like a myna bird. But you still like her more? Are you a pervert?"

"No. This isn't like that.
 This is about whether I'm going to obey Tohsaka, right? Then I'm going to obey her. I can't stop Zouken by myself, and Archer saved my life."

"That's... because Archer is your..."

"I'll give her the right to command me. See, that's just like being a Servant. Tohsaka, if that's what you want, it won't bother me at all."
I confirm with Tohsaka.

"............"
"Tohsaka? Hey, don't ask someone a question and then ignore the answer."

"Ohy-yeah, I'm glad you understand.
 My Archer put his trust in you, so we're working together now. He gave everything for you, so work hard and return the favor."
"Of course. I have to return what I borrowed."

...That's right.
No matter how things ended up this way, my left arm has been replaced by Archer's.
But Archer disappeared without fulfilling his contract with Tohsaka.
It's only right that I succeed the promises he's made.
"Um, I guess it's Ilya."
I say the name that popped into my head.

"Yeah! You lucky guy!"
Ilya hugs me.
I feel like I'm her brother, so I like how happy she is...

But Tohsaka is really mad, so my happiness adds up to zero... No, I think it's going in the negatives now.

"...Hmph. You've gone to a lot of work to flatter a little girl, Emiya-kun. Or what? Do you like little girls?"
Ow... Tohsaka scornfully emphasizes "Emiya-kun" to criticize me.
Her eyes look like they're blaming the socially weak, sending a wave of pain through my stomach.

"Haha, that's unsightly, Rin. It's unladylike to take out your anger on someone else when you get dumped. That's why Shirou hates you."
"......! D-Don't talk like a grown-up and say such a stupid thing...!
 I only talked about common knowledge, and first of all, who was dumped by whom...!?"

Tohsaka roars.
Ilya laughs and keeps hugging me.

"See, isn't Rin scary, Shirou?
 But don't worry. I'll protect you if she tries to do something!"

Ilya makes a big smile and embraces me.
I'm glad.
I'm twice as glad as before, but...
...Please do something about that cold stare of hers that doesn't let me excuse myself.

"What? If you have something to say, come out and say it."
"It's nothing. Your interests are none of my business. I'm not happy, but I'm not going to say anything about it.
 But more importantly, why?"
She asks me directly.
But...

"Well. 'Why'... what?"
I made my choice without thinking, so I actually don't know why I chose Ilya.

"...Unbelievable. Do you really have a thing for little girls?"
"N-No way, you idiot! I-I-I just said it because I felt like it, and I'm Ilya's guardian now, so it's natural for me to choose her! Do you have a problem with that...!?"

Man, I'm being illogical.
"Yeah! You're my Servant, Shirou!"
Tohsaka is utterly stunned, Ilya is jumping around in joy, and it's a big mess.

"......You're taking a defiant attitude now. Well, I'll let this go, but Sakura certainly has it tough."

I'm curious.
What exactly are you "letting slide," Tohsaka?

"But don't forget. Even if you don't use it, your arm is mine.
 You have a responsibility to take Archer's place.
 Your body doesn't just belong to you anymore."


I can't argue with that.
Tohsaka lost Archer, and my life was saved thanks to his arm.
...Then I have to help Tohsaka in his place.

".........Yeah, you're right. We'll leave the Servant thing aside for now, but I'll leave you in charge of everything.
 I don't know all that much, so it's better if you take care of the plans."

"That's right. I'm in charge of thinking, and you're in charge of execution. We're cooperating, so I'll make sure you work hard."

...That's right.
Regardless of how it happened, my left arm has been replaced by Archer's.
But Archer disappeared without completing his contract with Tohsaka. It's only right that I succeed the promise he could not fulfill.
But stillI have to stop Ilya...!

"No, don't go, Ilya!"
I jump out from behind the tree.
I grab Ilya from behind as

 she runs toward Berserker.
...The mad warrior's roar, the strong wind, and an explosion that even takes away my vision.
They all flow into my numb ears at once.

I hold Ilya in my arms as the wind knocks me to the ground.
White light fills my vision, and I can't even manage to stand up.
...No.
Standing up never crosses my mind.


...My body feels hot.
Something deep within me resonates with the attack.
I don't understand why, but this heat is in resonance with the Noble Phantasm.

"How"

My breathing has been deadened, just like my vision.
I can't do anything right now.
My body will not function as a human being as long as that sword is engraved in my eyes.

"Absurd."

I'm entranced.
My heart is taken away by something I only saw for an instant.

...That thing is an illusion far superior to the numerous other Noble Phantasms.
There are many that are crafted more splendidly and with better skill.
But the beauty of that Noble Phantasm is not its appearance.
No, to describe this sword as beautiful would only dirty it.

The sword is not beautiful, but sacred.
People's conception, legends weaved only out of hope.
It's not a myth, nor is it inhuman work. It is a crystal trained by heart aloneand that is why that sword will reign as the strongest fantasy.

My vision returns.
The sky is lit with dark-red light and is dark like night.
The light that split the forest must have been darkness itself.
The fire is burning silently, but the air is still cold.
Is it something that freezes oxygen instead of burning it?
The darkly lit forest lowers its temperature.


A swordsman is standing with the black fire in the background.
With Ilya still in my arms, I glare at the pointed sword.

I don't feel any hostility from the swordsman.
I fear my death, and at the same time, grit my teeth in vexation.

It's different.
She's a different person.
It's not just her hostility.
...She's...
I don't feel any of the nobility I previously felt from her.

Her helm breaks.
It must have been Berserker's last attack.
Her face is revealed, and although she is completely different, she's still the same.

"Sa... ber."

There's no reply.
The now golden eyes do not reveal anything, but plainly look down at us.

"Shirou."
Ilya's voice is trembling.
A sword is pointed at her, and Berserker is sinking into the shadow behind Saber.
The defeat of her Servant and her impending death.
Any young girl would tremble in this situation.

"Saber."
I shake off any unnecessary emotions.
I hug Ilya harder and put strength into my free right arm.

Now's not the time to be spaced out.
I'm going to save Ilya.
I'm going to save Ilya and return to my home.
So I can't just cower and wait for my death!

"!"
Saber swings her sword.
She tries to slash at me as I stand upand at that instant, parries three arrows shot from her side.

"Archer...!?"
I get to my feet, still holding Ilya in one arm.
"Don't stop! Take Ilya and run!"
The swords clash.
Archer shot at Saber, and attacked her without pause.

"......!"

But it doesn't do much.
Even with his godlike speed, Saber easily repels his twin blades.

"Guh...!"
Archer is acting strangely.
Looking, I see that the black shadow is entangling around his feet.

"How unsightly, Archer.
 True heroic spirits cannot oppose the layer of the cursed world. Right now, you are no different from the apparitions in this forest."

...The cool voice is definitely Saber's.
She easily smashes the black shadow and...

"Guh...!"
...Sends Archer flying into the forest behind him.

"Wha"
She struck with enough force to throw him back, in spite of his defense and the shadow holding his feet.


And once again...
Saber confronts us silently.
Her eyes.
They tell me she has resolved to kill me if I do not hand Ilya over.

"...Shirou."
Ilya lets go of my arm.
It seems she wants me to hand her over, and the last switch is tripped inside my head.

"Stay back. Tohsaka is in the forest. She should be able to do something if you make it there."
I push Ilya behind me and grip the wooden sword with both hands.

...I hold it at the ready, right in front of me.
I'll drive all of my power and magical energy as soon as Saber charges at me.


That's all I can do now.
I have nothing to say to her.
I can't apologize, nor can I tell her to come back.
I can't say something like that when she hasn't said anything herself.

Saber is in front of me as an enemy.
Then the only way to answer her is to fight with all my might.

"......!"
...I take aim.
I won't even try to take her life at the cost of my own. Saber taught me that such tactics are useless.
An attack with the premise of your death is only effective against an opponent as strong as you.
Against Saber, I can't hope for something as good as a mutual kill.

Therefore, I'm only aiming at one spot.
Her helmet shattered, so her head must be damaged somewhat.
That's where I'm going to strike with all my might.
I'll defeat my enemy and live on.
Unless I get that clear image in my head, I won't even be a match against Saber!


She's coming...!
Dodge it, dodge it, dodge it, dodge it...!
I don't care if I look miserable. I don't care if I have to crawl on the ground. Unless I dodge this attack, I can never protect Ilya

"Oh."

I'm dead.
I've fought Saber before, so I know this will be fatal.
The lightning-fast attack comes from the upper left.
Slicing through my neck will be as easy as mowing rice.

...But.
My head is still attached.
Saber's sword stopped just shy of my throat.


...What happened?
She silently sheathes her sword and jumps away.

"!"
...Could that be her reason?
The black pond expands on the ground.
The "shadow" is about to crawl out of there.

...I'm sure of it.
That's the thing I saw at the park the other night.
An unknown thing that's just like a cluster of curse

"My duty is complete. I shall leave the rest to you."
"I appreciate it. This is an easy job. I can make up for losing against the Majnun."
Saber walks over to the black mud.

...And.
She sinks into the mud, just like Berserker did.


I watch her until she completely disappears.
I don't care why she's still in this world or why she's my enemy now.
Now that we're enemies, all we can do is fight.
That is the nature of this war.


...But still.
I think for a secondthat she wouldn't have been stained black like that if I had been stronger.

"Emiya-kun...!"
"!"
Tohsaka's voice brings me back to myself.
In front of me are the approaching "black shadow" and Assassin, whose white mask is distorted with a smile.

"Let's run away, Ilya...!"
I take Ilya's hand and start running.

Ilya takes one sad glance at the mud that swallowed Berserker, then keeps back her tears as she starts running.
I trudge up the hill.
The town is unlively.
It's still eight or nine o'clock, but the town is desolate and devoid of any human presence.

", !"
Before I know it, I'm stopping and leaning against a wall.
My left arm is burning.
Maybe my tension went away by being alone, but my left arm started to hurt ever since I got to this hill.

"Well, of course. Someone else's arm is attached to me, so no wonder it hurts."
...I can't get my breathing together.
My arm gets hotter with every step.
When it gets hotter than my normal temperature, pain attacks my chest from my arm.

"Oh... So that's where it hurts instead of the arm, huh?"
I lean on a fence and take a deep breath.
...I think I understand where the pain is coming from.
Basically, it's trying to cool off.
I don't know how, but my left arm gets hotter every time it moves.
When it overheats, the arm sends the excess to the rest of my body.

"!"
That heat is enough to burn me, causing the pain.
The heat enters my body with a sharp pain, and it's more like a cut than a burn.
Every time I feel the red dizziness, I feel like I'm getting a long knife inserted from my shoulders and churned inside of me.

"Guhhaa, ha...!"
...It's not something I can bear many times.
I've had my stomach torn by Berserker and my ribs crushed by Rider.
Even with such experiences in mind, the prospect of getting stabbed by my own body sends a chill through me.

"It's fine, calm downit'll calm down if I don't let it get hotter"
I try to relax while looking up at the sky.
It's been twenty minutes since I parted with Tohsaka and Ilya.
I should've been home by now, but I can't let Sakura see me like this.
...I have to keep the abnormality of my left arm to myself.

"Damn Kotomine. What did he mean, it wouldn't interfere with my ordinary life? This can't be handled easily"
I place my hand on my left shoulder and press against the arm covered in red cloth.
Hard and rigid as steel, it doesn't even budge.

...Well.
I've stopped sweating, and my breathing is back to normal.
It's getting late, so I should quickly go home and see Sakura while I still look well

"I'm home!"
After taking a deep breath, I holler out and enter my house.
"...Oh... Welcome home, Senpai."
Maybe Sakura's been waiting all this time, because she's already at the entrance.

"...? You don't look lively. I'm glad you're welcoming me home, but I can't be happy when you're making a face like that."

I take off my shoes and go up into my house.
I want to rest for today.
I'll fill her in on what's happened today after I drink a cup of tea in the living room.

"...Wait, I can't do that. I have to tell her what's going on first."
Tohsaka will be coming soon.
I have to tell her about what's going on beforehand, or she'll be on guard against Tohsaka.

"Sakura, it's about what happened today."
"...Senpai. Aren't you going to say anything about that?"
...Then.
Sakura says something with difficulty.

"What do you mean?"
"............"
She keeps silent.
She's looking at my left arm.

"Oh, you mean this? Yeah, I'm sure you're surprised if it looks like this."
It's covered with cloth that doesn't look anything like bandages.
Even if she doesn't know what went on, she would assume something happened to my arm.

"Yeah, I injured it a bit. But it moves fine, and it's all right now. This cloth is just a bother, but Kotomine told me not to take it off.
 Well, he's the one who treated me, so I'm going to obey him."

I pat my left arm to show her it's all right.
...But Sakura is even more silent now.

"Sakura...? It's really fine. It looks worse than it is. It's just a scratch. It'll heal right away, so you don't need to worry"

"I-It can't be just a scratch...! Your arm's gone now! So how can you tell me that...!?
 I won't fall for such an obvious lie! Or are you not telling me because it's meaningless...!?"


Her reply is like fire.
...My insensitivity leaves me speechless.
I haven't even considered how Sakura felt all day today, waiting for me here.

"Sakura."
"Oh...... I'm sorry, Senpai. I-I didn't mean to blame you. ...You were so reckless and didn't care about yourself, so I..."

"No. Well, you're right, but you're wrong.
 I'm not mad because you yelled at me. ...Um, this is the first time I've seen you seriously mad, so I was surprised and was contemplating my actions."

"Eh... Contemplating...?"
"Yeah. It's certainly not good to bluff. All the more if it's to you. ...I probably didn't want to look bad in front of you. That's why I bluffed and tried to act normal.
 But now that I think about it, that looks worse. It's natural for you to get mad."

"Oh... No, you never look bad."
I do look bad.
...Man, don't tell Sakura about it so she doesn't get worried?
No, I was just putting on a show to look tough.

"Yeah, I'm sorry, Sakura. I lost.
 My arm turned out fine, but I couldn't be of use to you."

"Ohthat's not true...! You were splendid! I-I didn't see it, but you looked really good!"

"Ugh... No, I really was pathetic, so it hurts me if you say that. I couldn't save Ilya like I'd planned, and all I could do was come running home."

"...No. But you still came home. I'm really happy because you kept your promise."

"Ohyeah. That's good."
I scratch my head.
...But, well...
I'm embarrassed, but happy at the same time.

"...You're right. I guess being alive is good enough."
"Yes. You're good-looking. I fell in love with you all over again."

"!"
Sakura must have cheered up if she can say something like that with a big smile.

"Uh...... um."
I don't know how to reply to something like that, so...
"Um, what should I say, Tohsaka?"
"Who knows?  If you want my opinion, I just don't want you two flirting too much at the door."
...I ask Tohsaka, who is standing behind me.

Huh?
Our voices overlap.
Sakura and I both jump back at the same time.
"S-Since when were you there, Tohsaka!?"
"Why are you here, Tohsaka-Senpai?"
And we give the same reaction again.

"'Since when?'  I thought you'd be done filling her in already, but instead I find the two of you having a lovers' quarrel. Geez, do you even understand our situation, Shirou?"

Tohsaka sets down a large bag next to the door.
Behind her is...

Ilya, silently radiating a strange pressure.

"I-I don't mind if you want to continue where we left off yesterday, Tohsaka-Senpai.
 I'll fight you as Matou's magus as long as Senpai's protecting me."

Sakura clenches her fists and glares at Tohsaka.
...Well, it's more like a frog desperately opposing a glaring snake.

"......Geez. So you haven't heard anything about it?
 Look, Sakura. I'm going to put on hold what to do with you. My first priority is to defeat Zouken. We can settle our match after that. ...Well, we won't need to fight after Zouken's defeated, so everything should be fine as long as we can defeat him."

"Ehthen you're..."

"I'm going to ally with youno, with Shirou to defeat Zouken. So it'd be a waste to live separately, right? So I'm going to stay over here and train Shirou. It'll be hard work if I want him to become strong in a short time."

"So I'm going to borrow Shirou for a while. It's going to be rough, but you two don't mind, right?"
Wha
Tohsaka Rin sets a schedule even I haven't heard about.

"H-Hold on, Tohsaka. That's too sudden"

"Y-You can't do that...!
 Nee... no, Tohsaka-Senpai. What right do you have to say that!?"
".........I have to be mentally prepared first, you know?"

I stutter off.
Of course, my opinion is dismissed by Sakura's voice and Tohsaka's glance.

"Oh, so it's fine as long as I have the right? Then it's even less of a problem. It's because of me that he's alive.
 Shirou has to do what I say until he repays the favor. You'll give me a place to live if I ask, and you'll make meals for me if I ask, right?"

Tohsaka. Those lines could bring on a big misunderstanding.

"No way... I-Is that true, Senpai...?"
"Yeah. I want to object, but what she's saying is true."


"And it's better to have more allies, right? We know Zouken is after you. With Tohsaka's help, we can definitely protect you."
...And Tohsaka is Sakura's older sister.
If possible, I want them to be together, not fighting.

"......All right. I understand if you say so."
Sakura averts her gaze.
"Then it's decided. I'm coming in.
 Come on, Shirou, show me the guest room. I had my eyes on the guest room in the outbuilding last time I was here. Oh, where do you want, Ilya?"

"I don't care, but I don't want to be near that woman."
"Is that so? Then I guess you can have the Japanese-style room."
They're carrying on a relaxed conversation, and it sounds like they're close enough now to call each other by name.
"Then it's decided. I'm coming in.
 Come on, Shirou, show me the guest room. I had my eyes on the guest room in the outbuilding last time I was here. Oh, where do you want, Ilya?"


"Ilya? Why are you spaced out? You were so happy we were going to stay at Shirou's house."
"...That's not true. I was never happy."

A weak voice.
Ilya hangs her head and stares at the floor.
...As if saying the small step up is a towering wall.

"Shirou.
 Let me ask. Where is that woman sleeping?"
Then.
What happened to her depressed attitude? Ilya's now glaring at Sakura.

"...? Um, Sakura's sleeping in the guest room in the outbuilding."
"I see. Then you can go to the outbuilding by yourself, Rin. I don't care where I am, as long as it's not in the outbuilding."
"Is that so? Then I guess you can have the Japanese-style room."
They're carrying on a relaxed conversation, and it sounds like they're close enough now to call each other by name.
", So hot."
I wake up.
My pajamas are drenched in sweat, and my futon is kicked away.
I wipe my forehead and feel that it's wet with sweat.


...I can't think straight.
My brain might be fried from the midsummer-like heat.
I can't figure out what time it is or where I am, no matter how hard I think.


I go out into the yard.
I want to cool off my body more than anything.
...I don't know if the heat is coming from the room or my body.
I'm too lazy to think, so I'll sleep in the shed tonight.
It's cold there, at the very least.
It doesn't matter if it's hot or...

"Guh, ah!"
A sudden, sharp pain brings me to my knees.
". Ow"
I stay crouched, breathing heavily.

...I wake up.
I squeeze my left arm, the cause of the heat and the pain.
The Shroud is still wrapped around it.
The red cloth is restraining my arm.
I can move it, but it's wrapped so tight that the circulation is restricted.
Maybe this cloth is the cause of the pain.

"Maybe my arm's just as it was if I take it off."
The wild idea sounds very attractive.
First of all, I never saw my arm destroyed or transplanted.
It's not that I don't trust that priest, but I'm sure he makes mistakes too.

Maybe nothing is wrong with my arm, and my real arm will be there if I take off this cloth.
My arm isn't steel.
The cloth is just making my arm stiff, so if I remove it
My normal arm should be there.

Wha     I can't brea   my nerves, my nerves

           It hurts

I'm alive but       where is my sense

           It's cold

Death   hurry   I have to quickly get it back on

           It's scary

The arm      below the cloth is

           It's black

An arm that is not mine

"Whatwas I doing?"
What was I doing?
I unwrapped the cloth because of this sudden idea.
I don't understand what happened after that.
What has been done to me.
What will be done to me.
It only happened a few seconds ago, but I can't remember at all

"This is bad. It's really..."
I'll die if I release it.
The priest's words were true.
I don't know what'll happen, but what's under this cloth is not mine.

"......Forget about it. It's just that my arm doesn't move. ...If I think about it any more, I'll..."
I'll slow down because of fear.
That's not allowed.
Archer's arm wasn't transplanted onto me so that I could cower in fear.

"...That's right. I have to think about Sakura instead of my arm."
Sakura wasn't that different from this morning, but I don't know when she might collapse.
...I have to defeat Zouken and obtain the Holy Grail before that.
I have to think about how to do that.
A way to beat Zouken and Assassin with one arm.
...No, they aren't the only enemies.
There are the mysterious enemies too.


I don't know their circumstances.
I don't know what that black shadow is, nor if Saber became Zouken's Servant.
All I know is that she's my enemy now.

"........."
...To be honest, I know.
We have no chance of victory.
I don't know what this pain will be like in the future.
The difference in our powers is overwhelming, and I'm not even sure about myself.
How can I protect Sakura in such a state?
"Phew."
I release the depression in my lungs.
Such a ridiculous story.
Why believe in such a convenient deception?
I bet Tohsaka will get really mad before she laughs at me if she saw me like this.

"...It's fine. It's just that my arm doesn't move, so it's not a big deal. I have other things to worry about."

Sakura is a bigger problem than my arm.
She seems well, but I don't know when she might collapse.
...I have to defeat Zouken and obtain the Holy Grail before that.
I have to think about how to do that.
A way to beat Zouken and Assassin with one arm.
...No, they aren't the only enemies.
There are the mysterious enemies too.


I don't know their circumstances.
I don't know what that black shadow is, nor if Saber became Zouken's Servant.
All I know is that she's my enemy now.

"........."
...I know the truth.
We have no chance of victory.
I don't know what this pain will be like in the future.
The difference in our powers is overwhelming, and I'm not even sure about myself.
How can I protect Sakura in such a state?
"!"
I stand up at the sound of footsteps.
I know who it is without looking.

The Servant in a black outfit is silent like always.
She usually doesn't make a sound when she walks, but I'm sure she wanted me to hear her coming.

"What do you want, Rider?"
"............"
Rider looks down at me silently.
......Hm.
This is totally unrelated, but Rider is tall. There's something wrong with me too for noticing it now.

"What is so funny, Shirou? I have not said anything yet."
"Huh...? Oh, no. You're taller than me, right? Even though we've seen each other many times, I just noticed. I was laughing at myself for how slow I was."

"I see. You seemed like you were in pain earlier, but it appears I worried needlessly."
...?
It might be just me, but Rider sounds angry.

"Anyway, Rider. Were you the one who saved me today? I don't remember, but I think it was you that carried me to the church from the forest."

"...Yes. It was me. Sakura told me to protect you. I only obeyed her order as her Servant."

"I see. That was a big help, but that means Sakura used magical energy to use you, right?
 Then"
"Yes. There is now even less of her scarcely remaining magical energy. I will consume Sakura if she uses me like she did today."

Rider plainly speaks.
There's no pity or hatred towards Sakura.
Rider is only stating the natural fact as a Servant.

"Can I ask you something, Rider?"
"Of course. If you have a question, please ask it."

"...All right. Are you going to kill Sakura if she loses her Command Spell?"
A Master that uses up her Command Spells is first targeted by her Servant.
If they have not established a relationship of mutual trust, Rider will mercilessly kill her Master, using her life to stay in this world until she can form another contract.

...Rider is protecting Sakura out of duty. I see no affection there.
That's why I want to know what Rider's feelings are.


"Tell me. Are you going to kill Sakura?"
"Yes. If Sakura wishes, I would consider killing her to end her agony. But Shirou, I wish for her to live."

"...! Then you won't attack her even if she loses her Command Spell?"
"The binding of the Command Spell does not matter. I will protect Sakura willingly for as long as she remains a Master. I do like her."

"Ehreally?"
"Yes. Is it that unexpected for me to have such an emotion?"
"Oh... I'm sorry, I misunderstood. You didn't look that way, so..."

"You do not need to apologize. I do not engage in proper conversation with Sakura, nor does she talk to me.
 But Shirou. Servants are summoned by beings similar to them. You summoned Saber not by chance, but because you two are alike."

"Sakura and I are the same in that regard.
 We are not talkative, so it is natural for us to have no conversation. We understand each other without a need for such things."

...I hear warm emotion in Rider's voice.
I imagined her to be cruel because of her appearance, but maybe Rider is actually quite gentle.

"...I see. Yeah, that's great. I'm glad you're on Sakura's side."

"I see. Then it is my turn.
 Shirou. You do not know what kind of sufferings Sakura endured through. Do you know what she endured since she was adopted to the Makiri family?"

"That's"
...There's no way I'd know.
Well, Kotomine told me what kind of things she went through.
"...I don't know. So I don't think I can say anything about it, nor should I mention it."

...Yes.
I'm a magus, and I know what kind of a person Zouken is.
It's easy to imagine what happened, and my imagination should be close to reality.
ButI should not easily mention that I "understand".

"I thought as much. Sakura did her utmost to hide it from you. I would have killed you if you had claimed to understand."
"...Is that for Sakura's sake?"

"Yes. But it seems such measures were unnecessary.
 You are inexperienced and clumsy, but what is at your core is something trustworthy. That must be why you are a salvation for Sakura."

"...For a long time, Sakura knew only resignation. She did not feel pain or suffering, but accepted everything as it was.
 But she changed after meeting you, Shirou. You made her regain the emotions she had lost.
 The biggest emotions she regained were pain and suffering, but she only had resignation before, and you were the only salvation for her."

"......"
I don't really know what Rider is trying to say.
I cannot understand what Sakura has been through, so I don't know why she likes me.
But Rider's words are true because she shares her feelings with Sakura, her Master.

As if speaking for Sakura, Rider quietly states...
"Shirou. You said you will make Sakura happy.
 But for her, these two years were happiness itself."
...With quiet sorrow and appreciation.

"That is all I wanted to ask you.
 Happiness for Sakura is to have you alive and for you to be by her side. There is nothing else she wishes for."

Rider presses the question on me through her blindfolds.
...Asking me if I understand what that means.
For Matou Sakura, the fact that Emiya Shirou is fighting threatens her happiness.
So Rider is condemning me for what I'm planning to do with my body.

"But I"
...I tightly grasp my stiff left arm.
If I can fight with one arm, I should.

I swore to save Sakura.
I chose to fight for Sakura, and not to stop the war.

Soif I stop fighting now, I'll be nobody.


...Silence falls.
Rider is silent, and I have no reply.
How long has it been?

"......Are you on Sakura's side, Shirou?
 No matter what may happen in the future?"


I don't even need to think about Rider's question.
Emiya Shirou chose to be Matou Sakura's ally.
Then I should nod without hesitation.


I understand, but I can't express my feelings.
'No matter what may happen in the future'

Because I realize what those words mean.

"...Fair enough. You do not need to push yourself here, as the answer will eventually come to you. You should be prepared when that time comes."
Rider leaves as if melting into the night.
I watch her disappear, then look up at the sky.

"Damn."
...Yes.
I couldn't answer her because I realized.

The mysterious shadow.
The unstable left arm.
The ideal I sought for years, then threw away.
Everything is telling me.

That once I obtain the Holy Grail, it can make any wish come true.
Butmy wish to provide Sakura happiness is an illusion that can never become reality.
The shadow wavers.
The red knight is covered in blood, and Tohsaka Rin is sitting on the ground, dumbfounded.
About five meters away from them stand the silver-haired girl and Emiya Shirou, hand in hand.

...The shadow wavers.
After shrinking like a dead tree, the shadow expands like a blowfish.
No, its poisonous nature is like an uglier deep-sea fish.
The expansion continues without limit, swelling outward and dyeing the forest black.

At that instant.
The red knight dies protecting Tohsaka Rin, and Emiya Shirou survives by pure luck.
It is fortunate that the ground is uneven.
The expanding shadow passes over Emiya Shirou, who is in a hollow pit.
But his left arm is above its rim, unable to share in that fortune

"!"
She wakes up.
It's been half a day since she sent Rider to guard Shirou.
Matou Sakura, who shared vision with her Servant to follow the situation without ever leaving the house, is brought back to reality with that scene.

"Haaah, uh......!"

She feels like vomiting.
Her vision is blurred as if she had lost it, because she cut the shared vision off by force.
Her body is sweating, and as soon as she breathes
"Ugh... ha, ahh......!"
What's in her stomach rises up to her throat.

She runs into the dressing room.
She's covering her mouth with her hands, and as soon as she gets to the sink...
"Uh, ugh, uh...!"
She vomits out everything in her stomach.

"Oh."
She stands there with her head down, shoulders heaving.
Her long hair flutters like a curtain, hiding her face from the mirror.

"......No way. Senpai's arm..."
She recalls the nightmare.
...There's no mistake about the vision.
Emiya Shirou lost his left arm while protecting the silver-haired girl.
It melted away without trace from the shoulder down.

"What have I..."
Sakura masochistically yells at herself for considering such a thing.
She feels a chill and a strange uplift, not able to think about what happened and what she should do.
All she knows is that she hates herself.
...She previously got the idea that...
If Emiya Shirou were injured to a point where he wouldn't be able to go outside, he would not be in danger anymore.

"No... That was all wrong."
Yes, she was wrong.
It will not solve anything.
Was it simply carelessness that made her wish for him to be hurt?
Now he has been wounded, regardless of her wishes.
Not a wound that will keep him indoors, but one that threatens his very life.

There's no difference between the two.
That's what it means to be injured.
Why did she think that a misfortune to lose a part of one's body is a good thing?

"Ughah, uh.......!"
The nausea does not go away.
She does not stop vomiting even after throwing up everything.
Gastric juice and blood.
She thinks that the sharp pain in her stomach and the scratch on her throat is like a punishment to condemn her.

...And after a while...
Her nausea finally goes away when the gastric juice runs out, and she regains her composure.
She breathes heavily.
Her shoulders are moving up and down painfully.
She puts her hands on the sink and tries to calm down, as if she's just finished running a marathon.
"But Senpai can't fight anymore."
In a trance, she speaks her true feelings.

A short murmur.
Still breathing heavily, she raises her head.
The figure in the mirror is crushed by a feeling of guilt.
The apologetic expression is caused by her worry for Emiya Shirou's well-being.
She truly wishes for his safety.
The mirror reflects a face with a crooked smile.
It's hot.

I'm trapped in a sultry stone room.
The heat radiating from my shoulder is like a plague of microscopic bugs eating my cells.
My shoulder. The place where my arm used to be is covered with honey, and ants are swarming on it so it looks like a carpet.

It's hot.

My body is burning from within.
This isn't like a sultry stone room, but more like a sealed frying pan.
I hear the sound of something burning and realize that I've been scorched black.

It's hot.

The heat melts my mind, leaving my body untouched.
Slowly and fiercely.
It burns through my genes as if trying to overwrite them.

...Is this nightmare finally coming to an end?

It's hot.

The hole is sealed so that the ants cannot escape.
It's hot.
It's hot.
It's hot.
It's hot.
It's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot......!!!!!

The hole is in my shoulder.
I don't know why, but my missing left arm became a gateway, allowing the ants to flood into my body.
And the entrancethe hole to let them out is sealed with flesh that's not mine!

It's changing.
It's changing to something I don't know.
It's coming in.
Knowledge I shouldn't have is flowing into me.
It is his battle experience and battle information.

"Haah, gah!"

This is his Noble Phantasm.
It's not the pair of swords.
Kanshou and Bakuya.
Favoring the treasured swords made by an ancient blacksmith, he himself was a blacksmith heroic spirit.

That's why he creates.
He duplicates everything he sees and understands.
No.
It is not duplication, but projection.
A unique magic that reproduces the real thing using an image in the caster's mind.
Andthe heat burning my mind tells me to manage this skill.

"Haaahh, ah!"

Don't kid me. That's impossible. It won't fit.
I don't know about projection. I'm not at that level yet.
Cutting corners like this will destroy my body.
First of all, I have my hands full with myself. I can't memorize or use someone else's ability.
I don't have the needed power to begin with, and we're strangers with no connection, so there's no way it will become familiar with my body. No, I won't be able to bear it even if it becomes familiar with my body.
You can't put time out of order or destroy the regularity. Even if you help me, I don't have the skills to handle it

...My consciousness slowly returns.
I'm sleeping on an unfamiliar bed in an unknown room.

"...Huh...?"
I raise my body.
I thinkI met Saber at the forest, ran away with Tohsaka, and Ilya
"......"
Our eyes meet.
Ilya is beside the bed, staring at me with blank amazement.

"I see. So you're all right."
I sigh with relief.
I don't get the situation, but I'm glad Ilya's all right.

"Oh, good! You're awake, Shirou!"
"Huhwait, Ilya...!"
Ilya charges at me.

"Whoa."
"I'm glad... I'm so glad, Shirou...!"
Hugging me, she buries her face in my chest and repeats herself over and over.


...Man.
I don't get what's going on, but I can't do anything if she's crying like this.

"Does your wound hurt? I'll make him put on another one if you think it's slightly strange!"
"......? Oh, it doesn't hurt anywhere. More importantly, can you explain to me what happened after th"
As I speak...
"Gih!?"

I feel like a long knife is thrust into me.

"Hagih, guh!"
Unable to bear the pain, I tear at my chest with my right hand.

"Shirou...!? Calm down! Don't try to bear it, but try to repress your left arm...!"
"Ohleft... arm...?"
......I don't quite get it.
I don't, but I want to escape this pain as quickly as possible.

"HaaHaa, haah."
...I relax my mind.
Once I start meditating, I quickly understand which part of me is abnormal.
I can control it more or less if I know the origin of the pain.
I just need to create a barrier so that the foreign substance can't enter my body.

"Phew. I'm fine now, Ilya."
"Yeah, I can tell. I wondered what'd happen, but they don't seem to reject each other, at the very least."
"......?"
It seems like Ilya knows what's causing the pain.

"......Hm?"
I look at myself and notice that I'm wearing big hospital clothes.
...No, these are more like restraints.
All I can move is my right arm. Everything else is firmly belted down, and I can't take them off myself.

"What are these? Why am I wearing something like this, Ilya?"
"U-Um... that's..."
Ilya looks away awkwardly.
"I shall explain the rest, Emiya Shirou."
...Then.
A person I really don't want to see appears.

"She has recovered as well. All I need to do here is to explain the situation, so leave if you have no business."
"...Hah, yeah right. I'm going to leave with Shirou. There isn't a problem even if I'm here if you're not going to do anything, right?"

"I see, there certainly is no problem. But I would like to keep the explanation short. If you will not interrupt, go sit in the corner quietly."
"All right, I guess I'll do so."
Ilya passes Kotomine and walks to the wall.

"Well. I shall answer your question before I explain the situation. Do not be too surprised, Emiya Shirou."
Kotomine reaches out.
He unbuckles the belts and removes the coverings.

"Wha"
The arm there is not Emiya Shirou's arm.

I can tell even through the wrapped cloth.
...My left arm is not part of my body.
It is a foreign substance that should not be there, attached by opposing the natural Providence.

"Kotomine, this is..."
"It is Archer's left arm. In accordance with Archer's wish, I have transplanted it from his corpse."

"Archer's wish...? Wait, did you say corpse?"
"He disappeared after the transplant was completed. He was almost dead when he was carried here, but surprisingly, he endured until the operation ended. It must be because of his capacity for independent action."

"........."
Archer has been eliminated.
Then the remaining Servants are Zouken's Assassin, Sakura's Rider, and...

...No.
I don't think I can call her a Servant anymore.

"...Hold on. Archer disappeared, right? Then isn't it weird that his arm's still here?"

"His left arm would have disappeared too if he disappeared before the transplant was completed. But that has been cut and planted to your body while Archer was still in this world. It is a part of a heroic spirit that has been connected to your Magic Circuit, and it stays in this world using your magical energy.
 ...It has become a part of your body after the transplant was completed. The left arm will remain even if Archer disappears after that. That left arm is already yours now."

"Then... this is really his arm?"
"Yes. You two would have died in your conditions.  Archer lost the core that anchored him in this world, while you lost your arm in a mortal wound.
 Fortunately, Archer did not have many physical wounds, so he saved your life by offering you his body."


...The left arm that melted.
The heat that violated my mind, and this left arm that is not mine.
Everything tells me that the event in that forest really did happen.
I fell in that forest.
And I was saved by Archer after that.

"...But is it even possible to transplant a Servant's body onto a human's?"
"It's possible to just connect them. Spiritual doctors are said to heal the soul and not the body. I guess this priest here is the real thing, in contrast to his looks."

"I accept your compliment, but this is nothing to celebrate.
 Joining two separate spiritual bodies is forbidden magic. It cannot succeed.
 Spiritual bodies... resurrection and restoration of souls are divine mysteries that cannot be handled with magic. That is why I thought I only succeeded in shape, and expected him to die of shock, but"

"...Shirou and Archer are a special case. I found out earlier that he would pull through if the connection was made."

"...?"
Ilya looks away and lets her eyes wander sadly.

"Oh. Well, I do not know why. All I know is that you two were suited for each other. I was surprised when I started the operation. Even twin brothers would not look this alike."

I flex my left arm to test his words.

...I don't feel anything.
I don't even feel pain.  It's like a lump of dead meat.
It doesn't move, no matter what I do.
It's like a hand numbed by loss of circulation.
The sensation of a part of my body not moving brings mental fear rather than physical pain.

...The left arm is just a piece of metal.
One might feel constricted like this if one became a tin man.

"...It doesn't move at all. Was the operation really successful?"
"Do not wish for such an excessive thing. That is all it can do right after connecting it. It shall familiarize with your body in a few days. I told you earlier, but you two are compatible. At this rate, it should heal well enough to give you no trouble in leading an ordinary life."

"But be warned. I am only saying that the Magic Circuits are compatible.
 No matter how suited you may be to his arm, this arm is the arm of a heroic spirit, something a human cannot handle. No, it is more like a weapon than an arm. It is powerful, but it will swallow you if you use it."
"Does that mean I'll self-destruct?"

"Of course. If a human like you uses the arm of a heroic spirit, your body will be consumed by Archer's arm. No, the term blown away is more accurate."

"Your body is spiritually far inferior to Archer's arm. Archer's Magic Circuit will be activated if you use that arm even once.
 At that timeyour body will be unable to withstand Archer's magic, and it will break down.
 Look, it is not that your lifespan is shortened with each use.
 The time bomb in you will be turned on once you use it."


...What is that?
In short, that means I'll certainly die if I try to do what Archer does even once.
"......Then this cloth is for that reason...?"

"Yes, it is a seal. The Magic Circuit in your left arm will not be activated as long as you keep it on. Your arm is treated as a different object even if you use magic.
 But do not let your guard down. Magical energy flows through your body even if you do not use any magic. Pain will assail your arm as it reacts and tries to activate.
 Your left arm is covered with the Shroud of Martin to prevent that.
 It should be able to suppress the infringement from your left arm to a certain extent as long as you keep it on."

"Hold on. To a certain extent? That means..."

"It cannot completely suppress your arm. ...Yes, you will be consumed by Archer's arm whether you use it or not.
 If you want to live to old age, become a great enough magus to match the arm. You should then be able to seal your arm without the shroud."

"I estimate it will be about ten years before the arm consumes you. You have that much time. You can become a master magus and control your arm, or you can fail and be consumed. It is not an imminent threat."

"......"
This is like I was remodeled without my knowing.
...But it's no use complaining.
I would've died in that forest.
Transplanting Archer's arm was the only way to save my life, so complaining would mean I don't want to live.

"I understand. Let me thank you.
 ...You did another favor for me.  Could you please pray that it doesn't happen a fourth time?"
"I suppose I do not need to worry if you can talk like that. Then go outside. Rin is waiting for you in the chapel."

Kotomine heads to the door.
I get off from the bed and put on the prepared jacket.
I can't move my left hand, so I just drape it over my shoulder.

"Okay, it won't hurt if I keep my guard up. Let's go, Ilya."
"Oh... yeah, I'm coming."

...I exit and find myself in the courtyard.
The sky is dark, and it's already nighttime.

"I forgot to tell you, but you can easily take off that Shroud.
 The choice is always yours. You are free to use Archer's power, but your survival will not be guaranteed.
 Do your best with that in mind."

Tohsaka glares at me as soon as I enter the chapel.
...I don't know what I did to deserve it, but I'm relieved to know she's all right.

"Well. Everyone is treated now. Emiya Shirou's arm has been transplanted, and Rin's poison is purified. Is there anything else you require of me?"
"......Of course not. You might claim our lives as collateral if you do us any more favors."

"I see. Then we shall be parting here, but let me ask as the supervisor.
 What are you going to do now, Rin?
 The Holy Grail War is a failure now.
 The outcome is practically decided already, as most of the remaining Masters do not have Servants."

Tohsaka shuts her mouth.
...The match is pretty much decided, just like Kotomine said.
The only Masters with Servants are Zouken and Sakura.
...Ordinarily the last two standing would fight, but Sakura cannot oppose Zouken. Looking at it that way, it's already over.

"Matou Zouken will either recapture Matou Sakura or kill her. It will be difficult to stop him, and you are under no obligation to do so. There is no benefit to kill Zouken."
"Oh, is that because Masters without their Servants can't obtain the Holy Grail?"

"Right. That is why there is no reason to fight. Any more battle is meaningless.  You would be wise to stay in your mansion and wait until the war is over."
"Thanks for the warning. But I'm not going to forfeit."

"I'm surprised. So you cannot give up the Holy Grail?"
"Of course not. I'm still a Master, even if I lost my Servant. Don't assume that I'm going to forfeit just because I'm alone now."

"Oh. I see, you are certainly right. There is one other who shamelessly stayed on the battlefield after losing his Servant. So you cannot give up easily."

"Heh, Shirou has nothing to do with this.
 This is my decision. I haven't given up yet, and I don't intend to let Zouken win.  Neither of those will save her."

"Tohsaka."
I open my eyes wide and look at Tohsaka.

"W-Why do you look so happy? I-I didn't copy you, okay? I'm not giving up because I think I still have a chance of winning. I'm not like you, staying in it even when I don't have any chance."
"Yeah, I thought so. That's what I expected from you, Tohsaka."

"......That's annoying in a way too, but it's fine if you understand."
She looks away.

Tohsaka doesn't want to give the Holy Grail to Zouken not because of her sense of justice.
Sakura cannot be saved if Zouken wins.
If we want to save Sakura, Sakura has to obtain the Holy Grailor else someone who wants to save her has to claim it.

That's why Tohsaka said she or Sakura has to win.
That's the only reason she's fighting against Matou Zouken.
Tohsaka cannot obtain the Holy Grail anymore, but is still wanting to save Sakura, her younger sister.

"Hm. So what about you, Emiya Shirou? Will you not give up the Holy Grail, just like Rin?"
"No, I won't stop fighting. I have my goals too. I won't let Zouken do as he wishes."

"...I see. I shall not stop you if you want to fight. There is a hopeless difference in your powers, but Matou Zouken is a weak person. I am sure you can devise some plan."

"............"
"............"
We look at each other silently.

...Some plan, huh?
I can't come up with one by myself, but with Tohsaka, we just might figure out how to beat the old man

Our conversation ends.
The treatment is over, so Kotomine requests that we leave, as we are not asking for protection here.

"I'm leaving even if you don't tell me to. Hey, do you have a place to go, Ilya?"
"...? I still have my castle, and Sella and Leysritt will come if I call to them, so I still have a place to go back to. ...Why are you asking such a thing?"

"Well, it's dangerous to be by yourself, right? I want you to stay at my place if you don't mind. I think that's more convenient too."
"I don't mind, but I have to refuse. That woman is at your place."
Then.
Ilya answers me in a weird way.

"...?"
I stare at Tohsaka because I don't understand what she means by "I don't mind, but I won't go".
Oh, she looks like she doesn't want to interfere.

"Oh. So you chose Matou Sakura, Emiya Shirou."
"...Kotomine?"

"I do not mind taking care of Ilyasviel. Even if she goes back to her castle, Matou Zouken will only kidnap her."
"I refuse. I'm taking Ilya."
"No way. I'm borrowing Ilya."
"I'm sorry, but I can choose where I want to go."

".........
 That is unfortunate. So Ilyasviel is to stay at the Tohsaka household?"
"D-Don't say such a stupid thing...! The Master of Einzbern will not go to Tohsaka's house!"

"Okay. Then where are you going to go? You'll have to go back to your castle if you don't want to stay at the church, my house, or Shirou's place."

"I know. That place is my workshop, so I won't go into the care of another Master. I'm going to do things myself even without Berserker."

"Oh, I thought so. You almost killed Shirou once, but he came and saved you in spite of that. But you don't feel any appreciation and you're going back to your castle, huh?
 Did you hear that, Emiya-kun? After all you've done for her, she still hates you. She says she doesn't want to stay in that tiny house of yours."

"W-What are you saying, Rin!?
 I never said anything like that"
"You are saying it. You're not going to Emiya-kun's place because he's unreliable, right? You're saying you're going bac to your castle where you can feel safe."

"...That's true... But I'm going back to my castle because I have to get away from Shirou"
"Huh? Oh, I see. So him being reliable doesn't matter because you hate him, huh? Well, why didn't you say that in the first place?"
Tohsaka calmly criticizes Ilya.

"Oh."
This is bad.
Just as I'm worrying that this will turn bloody...

"T-That's not true! I never said I don't want Shirou! It's something else that I don't like...!"
"Hear that? You're really popular, Emiya-kun."
Tohsaka smiles gently, and Ilya glares at her with vexation.

"............"
...Um.
So whose house is Ilya going to...?
"Then let's part here for now. I'm going back to my house to pack, so you go on ahead."
"......? Pack? Are you going to come to my house?"

"Of course. We're cooperating now, so we have to be together. Ilya doesn't want to be at my house, and Sakura's living at your place. Your house has to be the main base, no matter how we look at it."

"Oh, yeah. When you put it that way, it makes sense."
"...Geez. I thought you were firm, but you're pretty loose too. Maybe I made the wrong choice."
Tohsaka sighs and starts walking in the opposite direction.

"...? My house is this way, Ilya. Why are you following Tohsaka?"
"It's just for a bit. Rin wants my help, so I'm going to go with her. I'll head over there as soon as we're done, so you go ahead."
"...?"
Ilya's going to help Tohsaka...?

"Really, Tohsaka?"
"Yeah. This is a serious matter, so we need one or two secret weapons. A secret I can't unlock myself might open to an Einzbern magus.
 ......But I really don't want to find one. If Tohsaka's inheritance, Kishua's keepsake, is just as I imagine, it's not something I can handle myself."

"Then I'm going as well. I'm not interested in Kishua's keepsake, but Zel Schweinorg's treasure chest sounds pretty."
Ilya's skirt flutters as she runs off.

"......Kishua? Zel? Schweinorg?"
I tilt my head in wonder.
I've never heard those names before. Are they famous among legitimate magi?
The guests have left.
The chapel regains its silence and the priest looks up at the statue.
"Was it fine to let the Holy Grail go?"
The voice comes from behind.
Where was he hiding? The golden-haired man asks the priest cheerfully.

"I do not mind. I never had any attachment to it. I will not stop the Holy Grail from siding with them."
"You're right. You had no wish from the startif your words are true, it would not make sense to stop the Holy Grail."
The man laughs.
The priest's words...
As if to make fun of the fact that he has no wish.


He does indeed speak the truth.
It is just that the golden-haired man cannot comprehend the fact, but the priest has no wish.
Kotomine Kirei does not need the power of the Holy Grail.
All he has is a thorough inquiry.

The Holy Grail merely answers one's wish.
It is a machine to create the desired outcome for one's own question.
Is there a meaning in obtaining the answer that one wishes for?

"Kotomine. Let me ask again. You really have no interest in the Holy Grail?"
"I have no interest in a machine that grants wishes. The same should go for you, Gilgamesh. Our goals are not our wishes. We are merely seeking pleasure because it is more fun that way.
 It is like eating food. A wish is something that is answered. But humans will not be saved if a wish grants itself."

The priest keeps staring up at the statue.
And beyond it.
To ten years in the past, when he still had a wish.

The man is a child his father was gifted with on a pilgrimage in 1967.
The name Kirei is supposedly a word of a prayer.
The father named his son in the hope he would be pure and beautiful.
The boy grew up according to his expectations.  Even as a young child, he had morals and good sense, showing such great insight that people thought he was precocious.
The father was delighted to be blessed with a great successor, and the son knew of his father's delight.
It is a great pleasure for a parent to know his child is gifted. That must have been why the man considered him valuable.
Understanding this, the boy grew just as his father expected.

There was no doubt.
His inability to love his father was unrelated to meeting the man's expectations.
The boy named Kirei grew up healthy.
......But there was one point.
He could not understand the "beauty" of which his father spoke.

One morning, he realized the inconsistency.
He woke up, raised his head, and knew.
He was not sure why he understood at that moment.
No, he wondered why it took him so long to realize.

In either case, he knew what he had forgotten.
His father prayed for him to be beautiful and named him Kirei.
That had always been his question.
The things his father considered beautiful...
The boy had never considered beautiful.

It was as simple as that.
He considered moths beautiful instead of butterflies.
He considered poisonous plants beautiful instead of roses.
He considered the evil beautiful instead of the good.
He had a common man's sense of morality, recognizing that  it is correct to be good.
But by his nature, the boy was only interested in the exact opposite.

Nobody can understand the agony he felt.
Even Kotomine himself was never certain whether it was agony or not.

But he worked hard.
He tried to be pure and beautiful, and pursued something he did not have from the start.
Shaving away the skin, ripping off the flesh, and dislocating the bones.
He even tried looking within his body for what he could not find in his mind.

His father spent over ten years on his pilgrimage wearing thorned shoes.
The distance he walked could stretch to the moon.
It was not for physical pain. For missionaries, the mental pain is far more significant.
The boy abstained from eating during their pious act.
If he was a sinner by nature, then according to the morals he believed in, he needed to punish himself to maintain balance in the world.

Ten years passed.
Unable to reach the epiphany he sought, he arrived at a single conclusion in its place.
It was simple.
In short, he did not have the sense to feel normal happiness.
Good matters that people consider right and find happiness in.
Philanthropy, trust, glory, safety.
Such matters did not delight him, and it's just that he was born with the deficiency.

All he took pleasure in was the suffering of others.
Murder by others, love and hatred of others, degradation of others.
Such negative concepts were the only things that made him feel happiness.
...His misfortune was carrying a sense of morality, even when he had such a mind.

The child understood at a young age that he was not in accord with the world, and he tried his best to overcome it.
He did not surrender to his condition by indulging in twisted pleasure.
He tried to save himself, one who could not find happiness in any normal way, by turning himself into a normal person.

And the path was his creed; to become a priest and preach life like his father.
It is said that God forgives everything.
So he thought God would even save someone "who is not born with it" like himself.

But the result was tragic.
He abode by the rules of God, followed the law, and lived modestly, but he could not find any pleasure greater than the pain of others.
He believed in the church's teaching that forbade immorality, yet immorality was all he had.

But there was no anguish there.
From the beginning, he sought after something that did not exist.
He did not lose something he had, so there was no reason for him to grieve.
The only thing that concerned the priest as he matured was the question "why?"

Yesat every crossroads of his life.
The pleasure of committing crimes.
One could understand if he reveled in his own corruption, satisfying his urges by committing crimes himself.
Wealth gained from evil deeds.
It would make sense if he entrapped others out of greed and obtained wealth.

But.
What was wrong with him to not even have the option of turning from good to evil?
Who could possibly be born a defective being and end his life still detached from the world?
Do they not come into this world with the premise that they harm the world?

Call of good sense.
Acknowledgment of morals.
Trial of justice.
Every one of these conclude that evil should not exist.
But what about it?
If it should not exist, why are such things created?

That is right.
If one has a deficiency, one should not be born.
The world hates evil and removes the faults.
But something that was never wanted was given life.
There are beings that exist to be hated and die.

The man inquired where the crime was.

His reward for years of anguish and blind devotion was not salvation.
Just... "why?"
It is a pure question, and also anger towards something unknown.

"Then why did you become a Master? You do not need the Holy Grail if you have no wish."

The inquiring words bring him back to the present.
The priestKotomine Kirei nods in self-derision.

"I did not need the Holy Grail. I was just interested in what was inside it.
 I sought the Holy Grail ten years ago because it tried to exist.
 No matter what it may be, I bless anything that tries to come into existence. That is my job."

"Hah. Is that the case even if you have no interest in what is born?"
"...Of course. Even in the last Holy Grail War, I was not interested in the Holy Grail or its contents. All I had back then was hatred towards a person who was the exact opposite of me."

But the priest ponders.
He can only find pleasure in others' suffering, but he is interested in the end of this Holy Grail War.
Zouken's actions behind the scenes.
Another Holy Grail that is about to be born.
Someone called "all evils of this world" was brought into existence by the people, but not wanted by the people.
If it would conceive such a thing, maybe that is

"The whereabouts of good and evil. Something that was stuffed in the shell, but never hatched."
The Holy Grail cannot give answers.
The wish-granting machine fulfills its owner's desire.
So no revelation can be obtained even if someone without a wish obtains it.
But

"What if I do not ask for answers, but instead create something from the Holy Grail that can give the answer?"
"What...?"
The man narrows his eyes.
The priest is smiling in front of the statue.
"Kotomine."
That smile is that of a dying woman.
That expression is worn by a man with no interest or desire.

"...The answer should come soon. If this question is a blasphemy to God..."
His eyes aren't showing joy.
The priest, like an angel that fell to the ground...
"I shall pledge before God.
 With all my might, I shall question the Lord even unto death"
...Looks up at the distant sky with cursing eyes.
"Oh yeah. Sakura, this is Ilya.
 Berserker's defeated, but we managed to save Ilya. We're going to have her stay here like Tohsaka, but please give her your best regards."
I introduce Ilya to Sakura, and Sakura to Ilya.

"Hello, Sakura. I hear you're the daughter of Makiri, but I won't look down on you. It seems you're Shirou's acquaintance, so I'll specially treat you like a human being."
"...You're right. Then I'll act like you do."

"...?"
That's the entirety of their introduction.
Ilya follows after Tohsaka to the living room.
And...


Sakura watches her go with cold eyes.

Dinner commenced like a storm.
...No, it's misleading to use the word storm.
That was more like a calm wind. Since there was no wind, I didn't feel the passage of time, and dinner ended like that.
The atmosphere was painfully tense.

"I'll cook dinner. It's like having soba to celebrate a move."
Tohsaka made dinner by herself after that. I hate to say it, but it tasted better than mine. Sakura might just be even with her in Western food, her specialty.

"Y-You're good at cooking, Tohsaka-Senpai."
Sakura was torn apart in shock, and she started eating silently.
I couldn't do anything extra because I was worried about things like Tohsaka's food, the fact that I'm eating Tohsaka's hand-made meal, Sakura's dejection, Ilya's tension, and Sakura's tension.

As a result, I couldn't taste how good Tohsaka's meal was. I was just made to realize how perfect Tohsaka is throughout the hour.

So.
"I need to prepare my room, so I'm heading off.
 I'll give you the details tomorrow morning, so you should rest for tonight."
Tohsaka even washes the dishes perfectly, then heads out.

"I'm going to my room too.  Everyone who went to the forest is tired, so your body won't last unless you get some sleep."
...It must be an insinuating remark to Sakura, who stayed at this house today. Ilya speaks without looking at Sakura and gets up.

"...Man, what's up with her?"
Tohsaka is just as expected, but Ilya's acting strange.
She's acting as cold towards Sakura as she did towards me the first time we met.

"Why is Ilya so aggressive towards Sakura? Do the Einzbern and Makiri families not get along?"

According to Kotomine, Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka are noble families of magi who started the Holy Grail War.
It seems the Einzberns were the highest ranked, so from her point of view, Tohsaka and Sakura must be below her.

"...Man. Don't misunderstand, okay? Ilya's saying that because she's moody, but you'll get along with her if you start talking to her.
 She's just really shy... Sakura?"
Sakura doesn't reply.
She shakes her head back and forth, and gradually starts falling back

"Sakura...!"
I grab her shoulders to stop the fall.

"...Huh, Senpai? Why the scary face?"
...Sakura hasn't noticed.
She looks at me like nothing happened, completely oblivious to her near-collapse.

"No, it's nothing much."
I let go of her.
"Oh..."
That must be why she noticed.

"...I'm sorry. I fell asleep because I'm a bit tired."
She apologizes for something she doesn't know about.

"...Well, it's only been a day. You should rest too. Let's listen to Tohsaka and sleep for today. We don't have to push ourselves to stay up."

"Y-You're right, I'll gladly go with that idea. I'll be up and well tomorrow if I get a good night's sleep.
 I'll cook breakfast tomorrow since Tohsaka-Senpai treated us tonight. I'm going to get back at her by cooking breakfast you've trained me in."

Sakura smiles jokingly and gets up.
...She looks to be standing steadily.
It won't change anything to follow her to the guest room.
Sakura seems well, so I have to believe in her.

"Yeah. Take Tohsaka down a peg.
 You're our last hope. We're cornered unless we can strike back here."
"Please leave it to me. I'll make sure to give her a punch."

"I'm glad I can count on you.  ...I'll give you what little help I can.
 We'll sleep early today and meet at the kitchen at six o'clock tomorrow. Is that fine?"
"Yes. I'll be waiting, Senpai."

Sakura bows and heads to the porch.
......Then.
"Um, Senpai. Please don't tell Nee-san about what happened earlier."
Sakura speaks in a tense voice without turning around.

"I know. You just fell asleep, so it's nothing to tell Tohsaka."
"Okay. Good night, Senpai."
...She closes the shouji.
Sakura leaves without turning around.


She must have been talking about the fact that she almost collapsed.
Sakura hasn't recovered as much as she thinks.
Kotomine said she won't last more than a few days.
Even ignoring what Zouken will do to her, she is unstable.

That's why Sakura's trying to act fine.
As if telling us...
That she's all right, and that we don't need to worry about her.

"...Nee-san, huh?"
Sakura says that word only when she's alone with me.
And only when she's feeling faint-hearted.
...Sakura calls Tohsaka "Nee-san" when she can't suppress her cries for help.
Their complicated upbringing created a wall between them.

They may be able to return to being normal sisters if that wall is destroyed.
That might be the best thing I can do for Sakura right now.

"...Yeah. They're acting awkward, but they show some hope."
This situation was dumped in our laps, but it may be a good opportunity after all.
I see a dream inside the breeding box.
Egg's shell.
Black yolk.
There's no memory of the sea of love.
Reaching the placenta.
The line does not exist from the beginning.
Labor expulsion is not allowed, and is melted into love.
There's no memory of miscarriage.

    Swaying as I walk.
    Wavering brain is empty,     and the grinding intention is forgotten.

    Shivering and trembling.
    The dried limbs are like paper balloons.
    Rolling across the ground.
  Floating comes after maturing.

    Roaring.
    Roaring.
    Roaring.

"Hey, look  that gi, iswet?"
    Someone approaches with squeaking.
"Hey, it's a pretty good-looking woman.  barefeet? Damn  she's ]"
    People approach me.
"It's .  bored  want to  with us?"

    Dried up laughing voices.
    I do not remember tempting them.
    I am scared, so I should go home.

"Hey  why  running "
"Hold on ? Hey  she re !"
"I bet  is. You won't walk nain  town "
"Hahaha! Yeah  that's  we need to protect  or ?"
"Agreed! I  to protect  socially  wea!"

" Hahaha!"
"Ahhahahaha!"
"Ahahahahahahahahaha"
"Ahahahahahahahahahaha!"

    They follow me.
    They echo loudly in my head,     so my stomach growls.

"!!!!????"
"Hey  wha, wgih!?"
"A-Ah  don't run, help  ehhh!"
"Ha, ha, ha, where are you gu
 Giiiiiiiiiiiiii!"
"Ow, ow, no, I-I'm sorry, i, hiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!?"

I see a dream of a breeding box.

Tonight.
I squashed a bug.
It is a bit sudden, but...
The entire city of Fuyuki is having a blackout, so we will be training in the dark today.

I don't care, but it's really dark.

Yeah, it's really dark.

...It's lonely.

...Yeah, it's lonely.

..................

..................

..................Hey, Ilya-chan.
Can I tell you the truth?

...I don't really want to know, but what?

Yeah. ............Doesn't it feel like there's someone else here?

...!!! Stop it, Taiga. Even if it's a joke, geko...!?

Ahaha! That was a funny scream, Ilya-chan!

..............................................................................................................................

........................Ilya-chan?
Hey, don't scare me like that. You're the one lying there making weird panting noises, right?

YES, THAT'S RIGHT, ONEE-CHAN.

Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Liar, who are you, gekoko!?
Osu! We're starting the Tiger Dojo, the place to save those that could not escape and died even after a strategic retreat.

Yeah, yeah, we're starting. Geez, this is boring.

Hah!

Why sulk, pupil number one!? I told you it's against the rules to bring emotion from the main story into this dojo!

Okaaay.
But I really can't back him up this time.

Hm, this is the worst sulking I've seen out of you. Do you hate the fact that he put priority on Tohsaka-san?

...No. I just thought it wasn't fair for Archer.

Hmm. Some hidden circumstances I don't understand.

Oh, well. Tohsaka-san, Archer-san, Shirou, and Ilya-chan all died together in a friendly manner!

Hey, it's no laughing matter, you dumb tiger!

Geez, we're done for today!

You are to go back to the choice and obey Archer's words.
You can't turn off the game today until you get out of the forest!

I return to my room to rest after lunch.
Tohsaka had something to do, so she went to her room with Ilya.

"I'm going to take measures against Zouken with Ilya's help. It should take some time for the crest to familiarize itself with your body, so you can rest for the whole afternoon.
 You'll just get in our way even if you're here."

That's how it is, according to her.
We have no way to oppose Zouken right now.
So all I can do is to wait for whatever Tohsaka's preparing.

Sakura has returned to her room.
Sakura was feeling dizzy while we were cleaning up after lunch.
I wasn't worried because she seemed well this morning, but Sakura is no different from a sick person.
Tohsaka and I told her to rest if she's feeling even a bit tired, so Sakura is back in her room now.


I check out how my arm's doing.
It didn't move at all before, but I can manage to move my elbow now.
It's still numb, but I feel no pain.

If I'm to talk about pain, the crest Tohsaka planted hurts more.
My shoulder, throat, and belly button.
It feels like bolts are in those areas as if I'm Frankenstein.

"My left arm is borrowed, and my body is held together with bolts, huh?"
It reminds me of cyborgs one would see in science fiction movies.
It's an interesting idea, but I can't laugh it off.
...I was going to check how my arm's doing, but I didn't even stand in front of the mirror.

It's almost two o'clock.
Well
I'll go see how Tohsaka and Ilya are doing.
I'm curious about what they're up to, and there might be something I can help with.

"Nope. You're just a bother, so get out of here."
Then.
One second after I knock, she kicks me out without time for a rebuttal.

"Hey, what's with that attitude? It could get scary later if you kick away someone's goodwill."

"What goodwill? We're going to be using the Tohsaka and Einzbern's secret magic, so there's no way we can show it to other people.
 I'm glad to know you want to help, but your behavior itself is harmful. I'm sure you don't want us finding out about your secrets, right?"


...I see.
When she puts it that way, I see her point.
There are things I can't tell her, even if we're cooperating.
Anyway.

"Tohsaka. Why are you wearing glasses?"
"...Why? ...What, does it look funny?"
"Well, it's not funny, but"
Her honor student style has upgraded, and she looks like some president now.

"It really suits you."
"...I-I see. I don't really know because I only wear glasses when I'm alone, but... it doesn't look funny?"

"No. I might be tricked into believing that you're an honor student even though I know your true nature. Are you trying to hide your character?"

Hm? Did the room suddenly get cold?

"Tohsaka? Um, I'm suddenly getting chills running down my back."
I ask her with my eyes if it's just my imagination.
"Oh, what a coincidence. My shoulders are shaking too, Emiya-kun.
 I'm thinking I should settle my match with you. If you have enough free time to be walking around, how about I train you until you can't walk?"

"Uhum."
...Scary. She's serious.
It seems she really wants to punish me for walking around when she told me to rest and save up my energy.

"...Sorry, I was being careless. I'll go rest in my room like you told me to."

"...Hmph. It's fine, but don't you have something else to do if you can walk around like that? We aren't the only ones who might need your help."
"...? Who else needs my help?"

"Right in the next room. For her, having you by her side is a big deal. You should know that. You're the source of Sakura's energy."


My face burns up.
It's really embarrassing to have someone else say that.

"Oh, okay, I understand. If I can go see Sakura, I'm going to."
I nod awkwardly like a robot.

"Of course you can go.
 ...Geez, you're usually rough, but you're really careful in the stupidest things, idiot."

She shuts the door.
Sakura's room is right next door, not even a meter away.

"Calm down, calm downI'm just going to see how she's doing."
I take a deep breath and glare at the door of the next room.
I-It's not like I have a guilty conscience.
I'm just going to check if Sakura's really resting or not.
Come to think of it, I haven't seen Rider all day.
Considering her, I'm sure she's keeping watch on Sakura from a distance, but I have to greet her if she's around.

Rider is nowhere in the house.
There's her room, but it didn't even look like it had been used.
Then a place where she may like and where Sakura's room is in view...

This is the only place I can think of.
The shed is the only spot that has a good view of Sakura's room, is concealed, and is unoccupied.

"Are you here, Rider?"
I call out to the empty shed.
"I am standing by. Do you need something, Shirou?"
Rider must've been in spirit form, as she suddenly appears.

"........."
Well.
I came to greet her, but I get tense when I actually stand face to face with her.
I don't care about Rider's personality to keep everyone distant from her, but as a guy, her overexposing outfit is troublesome.

"...I asked you if you had any business."
"Oh, no. I really don't have any. I haven't greeted you today, so I just wanted to say good morning."

"I see. You must have a lot of free time."
Her response is direct.
But this is within my expectations. This is actually easier for me to handle because this is what I expect from Rider.

"Yeah, I'm bored. I have some free time, so I'm just walking around. Are you guarding Sakura from here?"
"Yes. I am Sakura's Servant.
 I will not protect you or Tohsaka Rin unless she gives me an order to do so."

"Really? I'm glad to hear you say that."
I sigh with relief.
I was worried, but it seems Sakura isn't pushing herself.

"Thank you, Rider. Please give Sakura your best regards in the future as well."
I wave and head for the yard.
"Please wait. I have a question."
"...?"
I stop in front of the door.

"What? There aren't many things I can answer."
"No, this is about you, so you should be able to answer.
 Emiya Shirou. I do not understand your previous statement.
 I refused to be your guard.  How can you call that a good thing?"

"Huh? Oh, that's your question?
 I'm sure I'd sleep better with knowing you were guarding me, but I'm a guy, and guys are supposed to protect themselves.
 Tohsaka is... well, I'm sure she would deal with anything that came her way."
"......You are going to protect yourself with that body of yours? It only sounds like a bluff to me."

"It is. We're the weaker ones, so we'll lose unless we bluff.
 ...Well, to be honest, I can't help but feel uneasy. But I still want you to keep this stance. It will tire Sakura if you move around. I don't want Sakura to use any more magical energy."

"I see.  Moving about will certainly burden her.
 I burden her just by taking form. So you do not want me to take on excess work?"

"Right. I just want you to protect Sakura.
 And if I ever get killed, can you protect Ilya as well?"
"...How convenient of you. You know I am a burden, but you want to rely on me in the worst case?"

"Yeah... Is that asking too much?"

Rider doesn't answer.
Her blindfolded eyes stare directly at me.

"Um... why not make a deal? I'll definitely help you if you're in danger. It's give and take, so can you take Ilya into account as well?"

"I cannot respond to that. There is a high probability that you would already be dead if I were in danger. Your proposal is not attractive."

"Gah. You're right. It's meaningless if I'm dead before you're in danger. ...Oh, I'm sorry. I was really being convenient."

...But I'm troubled now.
That means it's better to take Ilya to a safer place.
She doesn't want to go the church, but leaving her alone in her castle is even more

"Geez. You really are unreliable."
"Huh? Did you say something, Rider?"
"Yes. I said I will consider your proposal. If you save me when I am in danger, I shall definitely do as you wish. Is that all right, Shirou?"

"Ohreally...!? I was being really convenient, you know!?"
"This is reasonable. It is only if you save me first."


I'm stunned.
...Um, I'm glad that Rider accepted my proposal, but, more than that...

"Rider. Did you just smile?"
"No. There was nothing to be happy about, so there is no reason to smile."
"But you were smiling, even if there wasn't a reason. It was really subtle, so I almost didn't catch it."

"That is not possible. You are mistaken as I am denying the fact."
Rider declares.
Hmm, now that she mentions it, maybe she's right.

"............"
"............"
Hm... The air is getting strangely tense now.
I was going to go back to the main building, but I'm concerned about Rider.
She's silent and cold like always, but it seems like she has something she wants to say.

"............"
"............"
The air gets tense as if we're facing off.

...But...
I know this is abrupt, but Rider is tall.
Long hair, slender limbs...
I've only seen it once, but her face under the mask was beautiful.
Tohsaka and Sakura are beautiful too, but Rider has an entirely different sort of beauty.

"Do you have a question, Shirou?"
"Huh? Oh, it's not much of a question, but can I ask it?"
"I do not mind. What is it?"
"Okay. You're tall, Rider. Exactly how tall are you?"
I ask her straight-out.

...Wait.
Why is she backing up?

"Rider?"
"N-No, it is nothing. Please do not mind me."
"...All right. So, how tall are you? You're taller than me, so you must be over 170."
"I-I will not answer that question. Please ask me something different."

"You won't answer? You don't know how tall you are?"
"N-No, that is not the case. ...Regardless, please ask me something different. I will be angry if you persist in this."

"Hm."
Rider is obviously disturbed.
The usually cool Rider is flustered, so could it mean that

"Rider. Are you self-conscious about your height?"

Rider freezes.
It seems I guessed right.

"............"
"............"
We both shut our mouths.
She must not be able to bear the silence...

"...I-Is it strange...? For me to be worried about such a thing?"
"Huh? No, I was just wondering why, and not because I found it strange. Why does it bother you?"

"...Is it not obvious? A tall woman like me is unsightly, unattractive"
"Why? It's good-looking."
Actually, she's asking too much.
I want her height. Really.

"............"
"............"
And silence again.
It finally occurs to me that I could be distracting her from guard duty.

"Um. Am I bothering you, Rider?"
"...Yes. I am hiding in preparation for Matou Zouken's surprise attack. However, it will do little good if you are talking to me like this."
"Right. Then I'll be going back now. I'm sorry I bothered you."
"Ohhold on, Shirou."

She stops me, and I turn around for a second time.
Rider bites her lip in annoyance, then...

"If you have free time, please go nurse Sakura. It really matters to Sakura if you are there with her or not."
"Oh... you're right, I'll go right away. Sakura pushes herself when I'm not watching. I'll go see if she's really resting or not."

Rider's right.
Sakura's room is near here, so I'll take care of her this afternoon.

"Oh. That's right. I remember why I came here."
I turn to Rider for the third time.

"W-What is it, Shirou?"
"Good morning, Rider. I haven't greeted you yet, right?"
Good, good.
It'd just be stupid if I forgot to greet her when this is the whole reason I came here.

...Then.
"Good morning, Shirou. Then I shall also say something I held back."
Rider regains her composure and looks down at me coldly.

"What?"
"You waste effort on useless matters. It is too late for a morning greeting. It is already after noon."

"Ugh, I'm sorry. I honestly forgot about you until just now."
"I thought as much. Please take better care in the future.
 And please forget what I said earlier."
"...? What do you mean?"
"How you must think I am a nuisance. I misunderstood you, so I take it back."

"I don't think you're a nuisance."
"I understand that. I would expect no less from a person who comes out to greet me."

She smiles.
I'm not mistaken.
She's really smiling.
I'll go see how Sakura's doing.
She did go back to her room, but I'm worried if she's really resting or not.
"You there, Sakura?"
I knock quietly.

"Oh, Senpai...?"
I hear a sluggish voice.
"Oh, please hold on. I'll get changed right away...!"
She must've been sleeping, and now she's scrambling to meet me.
After two minutes...

"Sorry to keep you waiting. Please come in."
"Oh... okay, excuse me."

I suddenly get nervous that I'm about to enter a girl's room.
I've been here before, but the situation is different.
Sakura wasn't conscious back then, but now she's opening the door and inviting me in.

"So, is anything wrong, Senpai? I was sleeping, so I don't know if anything went on."
"Oh, it's nothing like that. I didn't come here because something happened. I just came because I was worried that you weren't resting properly... but"
It seems I woke her up as a result.

"Aha, then I passed. I was resting like you told me to."
"Yeah. I'm sorry for waking you up. You should know about your own body. You wouldn't push yourself and move around if you're sick. ...It seems I was caring excessively."
I contemplate my actions.
But Sakura starts laughing.

"...Ugh. I'm worrying too much?"
"No, that's not true. You're pretty sharp.
 To be honest, I wanted to continue cleaning.
 I was thinking about sneaking out if you didn't come."
"Whoa... sneak out?"

"Yes. I didn't want to rest when I feel fine because it makes me feel like I'm sick. So I wanted to act normal, in spite of what you told me.
 But Nee-san got mad and told me not to be foolish.
 She said it's a bother to you two if I push myself and collapse."

"Hm."
...That's right.
We stopped Sakura from doing the laundry after lunch.
She wouldn't listen to me, but when I was wondering how to convince her, Tohsaka came to help.

But it wasn't anything nice...
"If you collapse, we'll have to kill you."
...As her harsh words would indicate.

"...Yeah. Tohsaka was mad."
"Yes. Nee-san scolded me."

Sakura sounds happy.
......I see.
She knows that Tohsaka cares about her, no matter what she said.

"Then you have to rest.
 No matter what you may think, your body's tired. Tohsaka and I can go outside without worries if you're resting like this."

"...You're right. But I'm really healthy. I'm just not feeling well right now, and I'll be back to normal tomorrow. This is just like that cold, and I'll get over it in a day."

"...You idiot. I know I'm not one to talk after I woke you up, but you should rest.  Sleep, if you can.
 I'll come wake you up for dinner, so you just relax until then."
I get up to leave.
But.

"Oh"
Sakura grabs my shirt.

"Sakura...?"
"UmI'm going to sleep like you told me to, but...
 Um, It'll make me happy if you're by my side."


Sakura rarely demands something.
She must not want to burden others, so she tries to do most things by herself.
But Sakura is asking something from me right now.
Well, this is nothing, but it must be the most selfish thing she can think of.

That's why she looks so uneasy.
I'll do any favor she asks of me, but she only asks trivial things like this.

"Okay. Then I'll stay here a bit longer."
I suppress my urge to embrace Sakura and manage to tell her.
"All right! Then I'm going to go brew some tea! I'll treat you the best Chinese tea!"
Sakura heads to the door in a hurry.

"Hold on. I'll brew the tea, so you stay in bed. You're putting the cart before the horse."
"Oh... Y-You're right. I'm acting strange."
Sakura hurries back to her bed.
I pat her head as I pass by and go to brew us some tea.

But.
This situation is more nerve-wracking than I thought.
I'm alone with Sakura.
She's right before my eyes, and I can see her bare neck and her captivating breasts.
That alone, umreminds me of what happened that night, and I don't know where to look.

"But to be honest... I knew you liked Nee-san. Because you're always so happy in front of her."

...So everything Sakura says goes over my head.
I'll lose control if I look at her too closely.
...I'm a man, you know?
Recalling what happened that night makes me want to push her down and get a taste of her body again.

"...Isn't it? I'm not attractive like Nee-san. And you seem to like Ilya-san too.
 ...Um, do you not like girls with big breasts?"

I take a deep breath and calm myself down.
I can't push her down when she's not feeling wellwait, having sex with her will help her.
Then it's not bad.
It's not bad, but

"............"

That's right! Tohsaka is next door, first of all!
They'll notice right away if I do such a thing, so I'm sure they'll look down on me for doing it so early in the day

"......Wait, Sakura...? ...Um, did I do something to make you angry?"
Realizing that Sakura is unhappy, I come back to the real world.

"...No, you haven't done anything. That's the problem."
"...?"
"...Um, I said something very suggestive. You weren't listening, though."

"Ugh... I'm sorry. I was spaced out. Um, I think we were talking about Tohsaka..."
"Yes. We were talking about Nee-san. I was asking if you're happy now that Nee-san's staying here."

"Oh"
...That's right.
I was asking Sakura about our situation.

"So how is it? You like Tohsaka, right? So doesn't this make you happy?"

"...Yes, it is delightful. But I'm also feeling uneasy. Nee-san is my ideal, and she has many things I could not obtain. That's why I want to look away when she's near me, and I can't be honestly delighted.
 It feels like I'm being condemned by Nee-san and myself for what I'm doing."


I can understand Sakura's point.
It's painful to have your ideal in front of you because it makes you feel inferior.
...Well, I do understand, but...

"...Sakura. Your ideal is someone like Tohsaka?"
I ask timidly.
Tohsaka might punch me if she was here.

"Yes. I've always wanted to be like Nee-san. Oh, it's not as a magus, but as a girl.
 Nee-san can do anything, and she's always dignified. I want to be as cool as her."

Sakura sounds happy.
...Hmm.
I hate to admit it, but Tohsaka certainly is cool.
She's really manly in the sense that she takes responsibility for what she says.

"...I see. But you couldn't see Tohsaka until now, right? Something about the agreement between the two families. So how do you know about her?"

"You can't help but wonder.
 Nee-san and I don't remember about when we were small.
 It was so long ago.
 But we both knew that we were sisters."

"That's why we were more interested, and we watched each other from afar.
 We never sat down and talked, but I heard a lot of rumors about Tohsaka-Senpai, who was a year ahead of me."

"Oh. You must mean the rumor that she's a perfect honor student.
 Now that you mention it, you never run out of things to talk about her since she's famous."

"Yes. And it's not like I never met her.
 She would often greet me at school and come watch the archery club."

"...And I would always think at those times. That I'm content that she's watching me. I'm happy that she's worried about me, and I knew she would hate me if I ask for more."

"......? Why would she hate you?"
"...My magic is not like Nee-san's. There is no set limitation on how you use your magic.
 Senpai's magic is to accomplish something and to create a phenomenon. There is no restricted goal set from the start."

"Hm... You're right. Strengthening is one of the only things I can do, but you can use a strengthened object to do all sorts of things."

"...But the Matou magic is different. Matou's magic is limited to 'stealing away from others'.
 There is no other use for it. It only feeds on other people's pain, and there is no teaching to return their happiness."

"........."
I can't just nod in response to that.
I don't know what kind of magic she was taught at the Matou household.
The magic she was taught is a heresy, and Sakura is ashamed of it.

...The problem between Sakura and Tohsaka is the difference in their family's magic.
The more Sakura hates the magic of Matou, the more self-loathing she feels

"So you hate magic of Matou?"
"Senpai. That's like asking someone if she hates breathing."
Then.
Sakura looks up and starts talking like Tohsaka.

"I don't like it or hate it. I just couldn't live without it.
 I was adopted by the Matou family for that reason alone. If I hadn't been able to succeed them, I would have died."


"Oh, please don't make a face like that. The teaching was certainly strict, but it wasn't as tough as you may think."

"And if you want to talk about strictness, it's not even close to your training.
 I'm fine with getting hurt by others, but I'm scared of hurting myself.
 I want to live, so I can't end it myself.
 I don't mind other people cutting my wrist, but I'm scared to cut it myself."

"But you can do either. ...Um, I've seen your nightly training.
 I-It was only once, though. I forgot something here, came back, heard something in the shed, and went to check it out."

Sakura bows her head in apology.
But I don't want her apologizing for something like that.

"No, you don't have to apologize. That's carelessness on my side. I'm a failure as a magus if I can't notice the presence around me."

"...............Um."
"More importantly, when was that? Was it right after you started coming here?"
I really hope so.
I'm improving, even though it may be really slowly.
If I didn't notice Sakura's presence recently, that means I haven't improved at all.

"...It was last summer. It's the day Fujimura-Sensei brought a watermelon."
"I see, that's good."
I sigh with relief.
I guess I can excuse myself if it was half a year ago.

"...So, um, Sakura. ...Well, what did you think?"
She's the first person besides Kiritsugu who saw me training in magic.
I practiced in front of Tohsaka these past few days, but that's different from the training I do in the shed.

So Sakura's opinion is like a test.
Sakura is Matou's magus, so I might be able to get a good score

"Umm. I guess I'll use my right to remain silent. I'm not Nee-san, but it'd be terrible if I put a score on it."
"Ughdoes that mean I got a failing score?"
"Ahaha, you can say it's a really bad failing score."


...Crap.
Sakura doesn't seem similar to her sister, but she actually is.

"But Senpai. That's the only time I saw it. ...No, I couldn't see it again because I was too scared."
"...? Too scared...?"

"Yes. Not only that, but I thought many times that I should stop you.
 ...Your training isn't normal. It looked to me like you were stabbing your own throat. It's not that I imagined it, but it really did look that way. ...Your training was that dangerous."

I understand what Sakura wants to say.
Creating a Magic Circuit is close to death for me.
My body would explode if the concentration in me is off by a few millimeters.
But isn't that an ordinary compensation for a magus?
Kiritsugu was the one who told me that death is a magus' constant companion.

"Really? I hear that it's like that for all magi. Maybe it looks dangerous for me because I'm unskilled."

"You're wrong. It's not a question of skill. First of all, you're special in that you can use magic when you don't have the talent.
 Magic is not something you use, but something you teach the body. No magus creates a new Magic Circuit for each spell the way you do."

"......?"
"I'm talking about the final result.
 ...Every night, you did something that could kill you. Nobody forced you, and you didn't get anything out of it. But you stubbornly continued."

"...I think that's something even Nee-san can't do.
 You follow through on what you've decided until the very end, regardless of whether it's right or not. So you're probably the strongest one out of all of us."

"Wait"
I-It's really embarrassing if you say something like that with a straight face.

"YYou idiot, I'm not giving you anything, not even if you flatter me!
 F-First of all, Tohsaka's the strong one! A-And I don't know what kind of a magus you are, but you're the successor of Matou, and you also have Rider...!"

"No, you are strong, Senpai. It's not because of your Magic Circuit or your talent, but because your mind is pure.
 ...I knew that from the very first time I met you.
 I knew you would never betray anyone."

"Uhwell..."
I don't know how to respond when she talks seriously like that.

"...Thanks. I'm glad you said that, even if you're just flattering me."
I'm embarrassed, but I tell her how I feel.
Sakura...
Smiles happily and looks straight at me.

"......!"
This is bad.
The distracting thoughts I shook off earlier will return if she makes a face like that.

"...Um, I guess I'll get going now. You're sleepy too, right? There's always tonight, so you should rest well in the afternoon."
I cough intentionally.
I look to the wall... to Tohsaka and Ilya on the other side.

"Y-You're right. There's tonight too, and Nee-san is next door."
She must understand how I feel, as she blushes and starts muttering.
...I bet I look like that too.

"Then I'm going back to my room. I'll come get you when it's dinnertime."
"Ohplease hold on, Senpai...!"
"...? What is it?"

"U-Um... I'd be really happy if... you could stay here until I fall asleep..."
I bitterly smile at her intermittent words.
Actually, it's something I want to ask her if I can.
She's so timid that she probably doesn't even know how much I've fallen for her.

"Okay. I'll stay here if I'm not a bother. I'll go after you fall asleep. Is that fine?"

"O-Of course! I'll do my best to stay up!"
But Sakura...
I'm glad you're saying that, but that defeats the whole point.

Sakura suddenly falls silent once she lies down.
She must've been tired. It looks like she suddenly got sleepy once she laid down.

But still...
"But Senpai. I'll get well if I rest today, but what about your arm?"
She must have no intention of going to sleep, as Sakura keeps talking.

"My arm is doing fine. It doesn't hurt as long as I keep this cloth on, and it's slowly starting to move. At this pace, I'm sure it'll move fine by tomorrow."

"That's good. It's been a while since Nee-san treated it, right? It looked like it was just first-aid, so I thought the effect might've worn off."
Sakura smiles with relief.

". What do you mean, it's been a while?"
"Nee-san's at fault too. She's free to transfer her crest, but the Tohsaka's Magic Crest will never familiarize itself with anyone not from the Tohsaka family. She should know it was just a makeshift that won't even last seven days."

Sakura says it like it's nothing.
But
"Won't even last seven days...?"
It sounds very out of place.

"Yeah. It's about to wear off, so you have to get properly treated. My magic can't solve the root problem, so I'll ask Rider if she has any good ideas"
Sakura looks sleepy.


I can't reply.
...I can only convince myself that Sakura is saying strange things because she's about to fall asleep.

"...You're there, right, Senpai?"
"Yeah, I'm here."
"...Good. Please stay by my side, Senpai.
 I have nightmares if I'm alone, so please"
...Sakura slowly closes her eyes.
Her breathing becomes more gentle, and she goes into a deep sleep.

I turn off the light and leave her room.
"............"
I saw Sakura fall asleep peacefully, but I don't feel any peace of mind.

So pleasekeep watch and be on your guard against me.

...I think that's what she said unconsciously...
...Right before she fell asleep.
Light that destroys my eyes.
The strong headwind pushes my mind and body away from the entrance.

The light is too strong for me to perceive what it is.
My body, exposed to the wind, is rusting with each passing second.
How long will I stay here?
An infinity that is not even a second, and an instant close to eternity.
With no sense of time, years change to seconds.
Therefore, my body is eternally exposed to the wind, polished and clouded like a mirror, and crumbling apart.

"Oh"

     Go forward.
     This place is painful.

A zero gravity without any handhold.
An airless vacuum.
The world of wind erosion is not a place one can stay in human form.

That's why I move forward.
My volume doubles with each step I take, and it gets harder to breathe.
One step.
Two steps.
The third step is impossible.
I can't go any farther. The wind gets stronger the more I advance, tearing at my body.

But I have to move forward if I want to escape.
The wind is coming from the other side of the light.
The light is the entrance and the exit.
This place hurts.
So I have to quickly get to the other side.
A stronger wind is there once I pass the entrance.
Once past the exit, this pain would become lighter.

"Haah, ahh!"
I reach out my hand.
I reach out with all my might.
The light is in front of me.
But I can't reach it.
The polar light destroy my eyes.
I can't reach it no matter what.

It hurts.
I can't reach it even if I cough up blood and reach out.
Why?
It's only a meter away.
So why?
Why does it feel like I'm trying to head to the distant polar lights?

"Shirou."
"Eh?"
I wake up.

"You can't. You'll die if you take it off just because it's painful."

I blankly stare at Ilya, standing before me.

"Ilya...? Why are you in my room?"
"Because my room is close to yours. I woke up early, so I came to look at you."

...Man.
It seems she woke up before me and came here.
I don't care about that, but maybe Ilya did so because

"...Hm. Was I having a nightmare?"
"Yup. You were moaning in pain, trying to pull that cloth off your arm.
 Well, I came here because I expected you to do that. I suppressed the pain while you were asleep, so it feels better now, right?"

"Oh"
I now notice that my right hand is on the cloth covering my left arm.
.....Oh man.
If Ilya hadn't come, I might've taken it off in my sleep.

"I see. Thank you, Ilya."
"You don't have to thank me. It's between you and me.
 And I promised, right? That I'll help you when you're in trouble."


Her smile captivates me.

I know Ilya's just saying that out of kindness, but...
"Fufu, and I wanted to see your sleeping face. You were in pain, but your were trying your best to endure it. You were so cute."
I slam the brakes on my panicking heart.

"Ilya. It's not good to go into someone else's room without permission.
 Mornings and evenings are out of the question. I'm an ordinary guy, so it's troubling."
"Oh, really? How is it troubling? I want to know in detail."

"Ugheven that question is troubling.
 First of all, you're a girl, so you can't go into a guy's room in the morning. It's dangerous. It's really dangerous. You're not just endangering yourself, you're putting the innocence of an adolescent boy at risk too."

"Really? But that makes even less sense. What's so bad, and what's so dangerous about it? I won't stop unless you tell me why."

The silver-haired girl puts her hand down, gets on all fours, and...
"See, I'm closer to you now. So, why is it troubling for me to come near you in the morning, Shirou?"
"Y-Y-Y-Y-You idiot...!!!!!"

I roll backward head-over-heels while keeping ahold of my futon.
That was close.
Guys experience a certain physiological phenomenon every morning.
I could be given a man's mark of shame if she comes close to me in such an outf

"Oh."
"Gah"
I hit the back of my head hard.

"Ah, guhthat's why... I said it's dangerous."
I make up an excuse.

"O-Okay. I'm sorry, Shirou.
 ...Um, did it hurt...?"
It hurts.
I saw stars and my head is throbbing, but I can't be whining if I hear a voice like that.

"No, I'm fine. It was a good wake-up call, so don't worry about it."
I shake my head and get up.
My morning issue has calmed down thanks to that.

"...All right. It's about time, so I'm going to go cook breakfast. What do you want, Ilya? If there's anything you don't like, say so now."

"Eh? No way, you can cook!?"
"Well, I can cook like everyone else. I don't know about Western snacks... but I guess I can manage pancakes."
Ilya's face lights up.
It seems the fact that I can cook is a delightful thing for Ilya.

"Hmm... Then do you want to make it together? I thought I'd go get you after breakfast's done, but it's better for you to be in the living room if you're awake."
"Really!? Yeah, I'll go! I want to see you wearing an apron!"

"I see. Then let's beat Tohsaka together with the three of us.
 I promised Sakura we'd be cooking together this morning, so we'll have the strength of three with your help."
"No. I'm not going if Sakura's there. You go by yourself, Shirou."

"Eh... Why? Because Sakura's there? Do you hate Sakura?"
"No, I actually rather like her. But I can't approve of her because she's not suited for you."
"...? What do you mean by not suited, Ilya?"

"It's true. You ought to know why, but you're trying so hard not to notice it. Telling you now won't do any good."
Ilya goes out into the hallway.

"And I don't know what kind of trance you were in, but don't keep charging ahead recklessly. You're watching Archer's magic, not Shirou's magic.
 ...I know you'll eventually obtain the magic, but there's only the possibility right now. Your body will destroy itself from within if you try projection in such a state."

"Projection?"
I repeat Ilya's word absentmindedly.
At that instant...
The cocking hammer goes down.
The dream I saw while I was treated.
I vaguely understand what it is and what it means.

It's probably...
Projection taken to the utmost limit, reproducing every weapon you've ever seen and making them your own.

"...That's right. Archer's Noble Phantasm is 'magic' that only he can use.
 Archer is a blacksmith heroic spirit that can reproduce any weapon he sees. The power is something you can use too, now that you inherited his arm. You're probably not conscious of it now,  but you'll remember the activation spell if you put your mind to it."

"But don't think about using it just because you can. That priest is right. If you remove the cloth and use projection even once, you will certainly die.
 ...So don't take it off, no matter what. I won't forgive you if you die like Kiritsugu. I'll never forgive you if you leave me alone before I kill you."

Ilya leaves.
Her warning contains both caring strictness and murderous hostility.
"Senpai, I'm done cleaning the turnip. How are the chicken wings going?"
"Yeah, I'm done skimming the foam. Let's cook it once we've cut those into four pieces."

"Okay. What are you doing with the curry powder, Senpai?"
"I'm making the sauce. We'll put it on the sardines. Even if Ilya doesn't like fish, she should be able to eat it if it's curry flavored, right?"

"I see, you're smart, Senpai! Then I'll cut the fish, so please check the simmering."

"Huh? No, I can cut the sardine without the knife, so you don't have to. I'll ask for your help when I get to the center bone, so can you make simmered pumpkin with broth and soy sauce? I think we should have at least one sweet dish."
"Okay. Oh, you look like a sushi chef when you're cutting the fish one-handed like that, Senpai."

Sakura goes to the refrigerator.
Sakura must be feeling better after a good night's sleep, because she's in a good mood this morning.

"Hm."
And standing in the kitchen with her is fun for me too.
Sakura is thoughtful and is attentive to my needs, preparing things ahead of time.
It feels really good to cook with someone like that.

"Senpai? Sushi chef, your hands aren't moving."
"Hm? Oh, I was spaced out. We should hurry. It's almost seven o'clock."

I sigh so she can't see and continue cutting the sardine.
Sardine is soft, so it's better to use fingers than a knife. It's something even I, one with my left arm not moving, can manage to cook.

"But when did you learn such a technique? It's not normal to do it with just your right hand."
"It's not a technique. This is about timing and determination. I'm sure you can do it too if you try."

"Oh, is that so?"
"Yeah. Techniques are things like cutting apart a cow with a kitchen knife or making an ice sculpture.
 Here, take care of the rest. We'll cook it after you're done, so put it in the bowl."

I move away from the cutting board and walk to the gas burner.
I put the frying pan over the fire and pour some oil onto it.
My body knows how to do this, so I do it absentmindedly.

"Um, Senpai...?"
"Hm?"
I vaguely reply.

"...This might be none of my concern, but did something happen between you and Ilya-san?"

My hand stops.
But it's only for an instant.
I'm sure Sakura didn't see my disturbance.

"Yeah. We talked before I came to the kitchen. Ilya has a lot going on. I really don't know how to answer her."
"...Is that a problem as a Master?
 Does Ilya-san still want to fight?"

"No. I don't feel a will to fight from her. ...No, I don't think she had such a thing from the start. I think she tried to obtain the Holy Grail as the Master of Einzbern, but Ilya had another goal.
 But..."

...That goal disappeared long before the war even started.
Ilya's goal.
Emiya Kiritsugu, the one she wanted to meet, died five years ago.
Thenwhat can I do and what should I do in his place?

"Hey, Sakura. Is it all right if Ilya stays here if she doesn't want to go back to her country?"

"Ohum. This is your house, Senpai. My opinion doesn't really matter."
"What are you saying? This is your house. I can't decide on something important like having Ilya stay without consulting my partner."

"II'm your partner...!?"
"Yeah. Who else would it be?"
Neither Ilya nor Tohsaka can help me with cooking this perfectly.

"Sakura, the frying pan's ready."
I take the sardine Sakura prepared.
Sakura hands me the sardine with an airy motion.
......?
What is it all of a sudden?
Did she get a fever again...?

"O-Okay, I understand...! I'll do my best to get along with Ilya-san...!"
"Yeah, it'll be great if you can. Ilya said she doesn't hate you, so you should be able to get along with her if you talk with her."

...Yeah, I'll be really happy if that happens.
After the Holy Grail War is over, Sakura and Ilya will be here making breakfast without worry.
I'll pay any price for such a wish to come true

"Good morning. You two sure are up early on Sunday."
...Wait.
Something amazing just passed by.

"S-Senpai... did some strange person pass by just now?"
"...Ugh. If you saw it too, that means it wasn't just my imagination."
We timidly look into the living room.

The person that shambled over to the table glowers as she pours herself some tea and turns on the TV.

"...I'm surprised. Tohsaka-Senpai isn't a morning person..."
"......"
Wait, Sakura.
Doesn't someone who's not a morning person, um, look cuter?

Breakfast starts.
Sakura and I sit next to each other, while Tohsaka and Ilya sit across from us.

"Oh, wow. This has some refined taste, Sakura. I guess this deserves to be eaten."
I don't know if Ilya is attacking or praising Sakura.

"Geez. I usually don't eat in the morning."
Tohsaka complains as she eats the omelet.
"Hm."
...Then, for some reason, she silently starts concentrating on eating.

"......"
Breakfast continues quietly.
The only loud thing is the TV Tohsaka turned on, offfering many topics of information.

"Hm......?"
A familiar scene is on TV.
I can't be mistaken.
The TV is showing a baffling story about a park in Shinto.

"......A missing person in central park? ...A lot of blood around the area...?"

It's a pretty vivid incident.
An old man was jogging in the park, found a trace of blood, and reported it to the police.
A policeman came to the scene and found what appeared to be one person's worth of blood and pieces of the apparent victims.
...But it seems the pieces are just scraps of flesh, and that they don't even weigh fifty kilograms when gathered together.

"...The police are trying to figure out the four victims' identities... wait, why four people? There was only enough blood for one, right?"

"That's probably because the scattered flesh came from four people.
 I'm sure there were only leftovers, but that must have been enough to figure it out."

"...Tohsaka.
 By 'leftovers'... do you mean this is a Servant'sZouken's doing?"
"Who knows? I can't tell if Zouken had a hand in this.  But I'm sure that shadow did this. See the corner of the screen? The grass has turned black. It's exactly like when the shadow appeared in the forest."


Tohsaka states simply.
But I'm not convinced for two reasons.

"Why? No matter what that shadow may be, it hasn't done anything like this before. It has sucked up magical energy from people, but it never, um..."
Directly killed people like this.

"...You're right. The only reason I can think of is that there aren't any enemies now. There aren't any Masters now that can defeat them straight-on. So that means they can do whatever they want without worrying about whose attention they may get, right?"
"Does that mean they're being indiscriminate?"

"...I don't know. I'm the one that said it, but it doesn't seem like it. Even if Zouken and that shadow are related, I'm sure this was an unforeseen accident.
 I'll bet my omelet that Zouken is surprised to hear this news as well."

...Tohsaka's omelet is gone as she speaks.
Her hawk-like eyes are looking at the only untouched omelet on the table, mine.

"......Hm. Why do you think it's an unforeseen accident?"
"It's not cleaned up. With the blood aside, Zouken's not someone that would leave pieces of the dead body behind. In other words, Zouken was not at the scene, and that shadow was the only thing that ate there."

"I see. ...Then one more thing. How do they know there were four victims? There was only one person's worth of blood, and there was only one person's worth of flesh."

"It's the shape, not the weight. I'm sure there was four of something people only have one of. That way, you'd know how many victims there are without any identification.
 See. If there were four left hands in a pool of blood, anyone would know how many victims there were."

Tohsaka states simply.

I imagine the scene and my appetite quickly goes away.
After breakfast...
"Shirou. We have to do some things, so come with me."
Tohsaka takes me to the dojo.

I had no reason to refuse and I also wanted to talk to Tohsaka, so it was a timely offer.
It was, but...
"Hey. I only wanted Shirou. Why are you all following him?"
Tohsaka is unhappy at the unexpected guests.

"...Um, you're menacing, so I thought it's dangerous for Senpai to be by himself."
"Hey now. I made a pact with Shirou, so I won't attack him. You know that, so why did you follow us, Sakura?"

"B-Because it's my role to protect Senpai."
"...You declare, huh?
 Then how about you? You should know what I'm going to do. Did you come to heckle me?"

"No. I'm here for the same reason as Sakura.
 I know what you want to do, but I don't know how you're going to do it. I came to make sure you don't do anything strange to Shirou."

"...Oh well. I'm going to tamper with his body for his own good, so don't jump to conclusions and interfere, okay?
 We don't have time to be taking things slow."

She must have prepared it before breakfast, as Tohsaka's bag is at the dojo.
It's full of equipment like what I saw at her house, and it's easy to guess what'll happen, but...

"Sorry. Can I say something beforehand?"
"What? Don't tell me now you don't want anything that hurts."

"Of course. Nobody wants anything that hurts.
 Anyway, any normal person would run away after seeing these things with no explanation."

The other two nod.
I have two reliable supporters this time.

"I'm sorry I'm not explaining things to you. I know I'm not normal compared to you. You can go somewhere else if you have any complaints."
Oh.
Tohsaka's sulking, unhappy about the three-on-one situation.

"No, I'm not complaining. I have a vague idea of what you might be doing. That's why I'm putting every trust in you. I'll trust you no matter what you tell me to do. I promised you last night, right?"

"H-Heh. Then why did you stop me?
 If you don't have any questions, then sit and be quiet."

"No, this isn't about that. I want to make sure what our future course of action is. We have to decide now what we should be doing."

...Everyone's expression changes.
What I just mentioned is a problem we all postponed last night.
What we will fight against, and what we will do.
We can't back out after we make our decision.
No, we already can't back out, so this is just a statement of our resolve.

"........."
"I'm not going to take part in battles. I'll fight if someone attacks me, but I don't intend to start a fight myself. I don't know what'll happen even if I win this Holy Grail War."

"...I feel the same way as Ilya-san. I don't think I can beat Grandfather.
 The match is pretty much decided, so I don't think Grandfather will come attack us if we stay quiet here..."

"............"
...Tohsaka doesn't say anything.
I don't know what she's thinking, but I want to believe she has the same opinion as me, since she's not agreeing with Ilya or Sakura.

"You're right. I agree with concentrating purely on defense.
 Sakura stays here to defend against Zouken.
 Rider is with Sakura, so she should be able to defend Sakura and Ilya if she concentrates on defense."

"Tohsaka and I will try to come up with a way to defeat Zouken.
 We'll be attacked eventually even if we stay here, and we can't leave them be. We don't know if something like this morning's news is going to happen again."

Tohsaka doesn't interrupt.
It means she intended for the two of us to fight Zouken, no matter what her true opinion may be.

"I can't ignore Zouken, but I can't ignore the shadow either. Tohsaka and I will start patrolling the town tonight, so Sakura and Ilya are to stay here and keep watch."

I confirm the plan with everyone.
Then.

"W-What are you saying, Senpai...!?"
"Sakura...? What? It's nothing ridiculous, right?
 Tohsaka and I are the only ones who can fight, so we have to beat Zouken."

"That's the ridiculous part...!
 You can't use one of your arms anymore! Do you really know what that means...!?"
"EhSakura...?"

"...I don't get it. You're acting strange. Why are you going to fight even after what's happened to you?
 You should know that things are out of your hands now because you actually took part in it. So why are you saying such a ridiculous thing?
 I was relieved because I thought you wouldn't fight with one arm, so why"

"...........Sakura."
Sakura is trembling.
She's hanging her head as she trembles at her words.
I don't know why she's trembling.
The only thing I can do is to answer her question.

"Sakura. I'm going to let you win. That's why I'm fighting.
 Yes, I don't want to ignore Zouken and the shadow. But more than that, I want the Holy Grail.  Nobody's making me do this. This is a selfish wish of mine."

That's right.
It's a selfish wish I had ever since I decided to be Sakura's ally and not everyone else's.

".........Is that for my sake?"
"Yes. It will be for your sake if we can remove the crest worm from your body."

"...It's all right, Sakura. If there's no chance of victory, we'll make a chance, and we won't fight while we don't have any chance of victory.
 There's still danger even if we have a chance, but there's always a risk, so I can't promise you I won't get hurt.
 But I'll definitely come back. I told you I'd protect you, right? So I can't fulfill my promise unless I'm by your side."

"Sen... pai..."
Sakura looks down painfully.
It looks like she's apologizing.

"All right, can you stop it there?
 Our course of action's already determined, so it does no good to whine.
 Sakura and Ilya are to stay here. Shirou and I will patrol the town at night. We won't carelessly attack Zouken even if we find him. We'll chip away at their force only when we have a chance of victory.
That's our future course of action, right, Shirou?"

"Y-Yeah... It'd be great if that's your decision."

"Heh. I don't even need to tell you."

"And, Sakura. Kirei couldn't completely extract your crest worm, but he suppressed its action. So it can't run wild unless they use a drug on you like Shinji did.
 But at the same time, Zouken can't be the winner as long as you stay here in this house. He's going to come take you sooner or later, so refusing to fight is not an option. How can you say you won't do anything knowing that?"

"That may be true, butGrandfather shouldn't do anything rough if we don't do anything"

"Sakura! Stop being so submissive. Zouken isn't your grandfather or your master. Do you still think he's human after all the terrible things he's done to you!?"
".........No. I've never thought he was human."

"Then prepare yourself. Shirou and I will be fighting outside, so you have to fight here too.
 If Zouken attacks this place, you have to get away at any cost. The Holy Grail cannot be completed as long as Rider isn't defeated. You have a hope of being saved as long as Rider's alive."

Tohsaka's voice is firm.
...Is it the dignity of the older sister?
Sakura nods and replies that she understands.
And after that.
I ask why she brought me here to the dojo.

"Let's see. Why don't you get naked to start with?
 No matter what we end up doing, nothing would go right unless I take a look at what kind of a body you have."
And she gives me a ridiculous reply.

"Wha-"
"WHA-WHAAAAAT!?"
"...Whaaat?"
I continue in a small voice because she's more surprised than I am.

"What? Is that such a shock, Sakura?"
"I-It is...! You want Senpai to be naked!? What are you thinking, Tohsaka-Senpai...!?"

"I'm thinking about Shirou, of course.
 You're in danger, but Shirou's also in a lot of danger. You should know too that we have to get a lot of things done now."
"...That's true... but..."

"If you know, then don't butt in.
 Hey there! Don't just stand there and take off your top! I'm going to put on a warding sign, so I can't do it if you keep your shirt on!"
Tohsaka glares at me.

"Ugh......"
But Sakura's stare is painful.
It's uneasily asking me if I'm going to go along with Tohsaka.

"Hurry up. We won't make it before tonight's patrol unless we give your body some time to familiarize itself with it."
"Umm......"

This is no time to be embarrassed about something like this.
I don't want to take my clothes off, but taking off my top is like getting changed, so it shouldn't be a big deal.

"...Man. All right, Tohsaka. So, what do I do now?"
"Come here. I'll transplant a small part of my Magic Crest onto you."
"...! Over there!? You mean like this!?"

"Of course. I have to touch your body with my left hand, comprehend it, and share my warding crest with you. It'll tickle and hurt, but bear with me."
Tohsaka wiggles her fingers.

"Ugh"
...I can't run away after coming this far.
I give up and go near Tohsaka.
...Um, Sakura's stare is more painful now.

"I'm going to start now, but let me confirm beforehand. I said before that I'll put a switch in you, but I won't do that.
 In your state, it's too dangerous to be able to turn your Magic Circuit on and off so easily."

"OOkay, I got it."
I manage to reply with a high-pitched voice.
It's natural that I'm acting strange and can't breathe.
I'm naked, and Tohsaka is near me.
It'd be more strange not to be nervous!

"Hey. You don't seem to be calm. Are you listening to me?"
"I'm listening. I'm listening to you."

"......? All right, then.
 So this operation is to suppress magical energy.
 Your body is unstable right now, and we don't know when Archer's arm might flow magical energy into your body. I'm going to put needles into your left shoulder, belly button, and your throat, so that your left arm won't be connected to you unless you really want it to be."

"This is also a countermeasure against the shadow.
 That thing sucks up magical energy just by being there. The sign I'm going to carve into you will also have resistance to magical energy, so you should be less burdened when facing that thing."
Then, Tohsaka places her hand on my chest.

"Whoa!"
I barely stop myself from jumping back.

"Oh, was it hot? Can you bear it? I'm going to transplant the Magic Crest from my arm, so I can't lower the temperature."
"NoI don't care about it being hot or cold."

Tohsaka's hand is soft, and her touch sends a shudder through my heart.
Every time her slender fingers run across my chest, my temperature rises by a degree.

"......All right. I think I have a grasp of your chest. Next is your belly button, but this is going to hurt. I'm going to put my finger in, so try not to move. Don't worry, it won't injure you, and I won't move it around much."

"Heywhat do you mean by move it, Toh... saka!"
My body convulses.

My stomach.
Having Tohsaka's hand on my stomach is bad enough, but something rigid tears through my skin and into my body!

"Haah-hold on, that's, ba"
"I-I said it's going to hurt. Don't make noises like that, it's distracting. It makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong!"

"A-Are you stupid!?"
My face is going to get redder if you say something like that, you idiot!

"...Humph. I'm done with the belly button. All that's left is your shoulder and throat, so stay calm and don't run away."

"........."
I would really love to run away right now.
I would love to, but doing so would seem like I'm conscious of Tohsaka and I won't be able to excuse myself.

"Come on. I'm going to do the same thing to your shoulder, so suck it up. Grit your teeth and don't make any weird noises."
"OOkay. I'll try my best."
It's embarrassing, so I look away from Tohsaka.

It's not just my face that's blushing.  I think my entire body's turning red.
I'm blushing even though I know this is only for magic, so I bet Tohsaka's having a hard time too.
...Man.
How can I ever face Tohsaka again after committing such a disgrace...?

"All right, that's it. I'm going to put away the equipment, so you go cool yourself off."
Tohsaka grabs something that looks like a first-aid kit and goes to the corner of the dojo, where her bag is.


My face is still red, but I'm finally able to calm down and take a deep breathe.
...Then.

"......?"
Sakura twiddles her fingers, looking like she wants to say something.

"...Sakura? W-What's wrong?"
".........Um, well..."
She takes a look at me.
Then she takes a breath, as if preparing herself...

"Um, Senpai...! W-We, um... made love, right!?"
...And she asks me a ridiculous question.


My face, which had finally calmed down, passes its boiling point and turns red again.

"Ahum."
I feel dizzy.
Just recalling what happened that night is so stimulating that it makes me forget about our current situation.
So for Sakura to ask me fro confirmation like this, when I'm already off-balance from Tohsaka, is like getting hit twice as hard

"Um... Senpai?"

No.
This isn't the time to be speechless.

"Yeah, I did make love to you."
"R-Right!? Then it's strange for you to lose your composure against Nee-san!"

Sakura looks up at me unhappily.
...I finally realize why her stare was so painful earlier. It's because she was sulking.

"I-I'm sorry. But Sakura, this had nothing to do with Tohsaka, and, um, it couldn't be helped."
"I-I know, but please bear with it! You're m-m-my lover!"

"Ugh. I... know that, but..."
I couldn't fight against it.
I'm a guy, and I've admired Tohsaka since I got into this school, so I couldn't help it.

"...I'm sorry. I'll try to bear it next time. I'll do my best not to lose my composure."
"...Really? I'll get mad if this happens again next time."

She stares straight at me.
Repentant from the bottom of my heart, I tell her I'll do my best.

...Man.
I only realized it just now, but...
Having three girls under the same roof might be a really stressful thing.
It's eleven-thirty now.
With lunch coming up, the kitchen is filled with a noisy, forbidding atmosphere.

"Um, Tohsaka-Senpai. I'm thinking of making a dish that everyone can eat from. Do you have anything you don't like?"
In the kitchen...
With the refrigerator at her back, Sakura speaks timidly.

In response...
"I see. Then I'll make mapo tofu."
...Tohsaka cuts her off and selfishly starts cutting the tofu.

"They aren't getting along. What were you thinking, letting them cook?"
Ilya sits Japanese-style on the cushion and speaks without reserve.
Hm. It seems even Ilya can tell Tohsaka and Sakura are tense.

"It's just going to get worse if you leave them be.
 You should know that, so how did you let it come to this?"

"It just sort of happened.
 We were wondering about lunch. Tohsaka said she'd make it, and Sakura said it was her job. Neither one would back down, so I took both their ideas and suggested that they make lunch together."

"You said that? ...I see. No wonder they can't back out now."
Ilya seems to understand and takes a sip of tea with proper manners.
As expected from a princess. She shouldn't know the proper etiquette, but she's elegant even with something as simple as this.

"But Shirou. Couldn't you have made lunch? Why did you get Rin and Sakura to do it?
 Tohsaka and Matou are enemies, and Rin wants to kill Sakura."

"That was only up to yesterday. Tohsaka is working with us because she doesn't want to fight Sakura. And they aren't enemies. They get along, and I entrusted them with lunch because I thought it would go well."

"Huhthey get along!?"
"...? Is that so surprising? Ilya and I are friends even though we were enemies, right? Then it should be the same for Tohsaka and Sakura."
"Eh... Well, Shirou and I are special..."

"Being special has nothing to do with this. You'll understand if you watch. Tohsaka is being more blunt than usual, but she warns Sakura every time she does something wrong. It means that..."
"......She's concerned about her. But she's putting on a cold face and ignoring her because she doesn't want her to find out."

"Right. And Sakura knows that, so she's making mistakes she normally doesn't. She's concerned about Tohsaka too."
"...Now that you point it out, I can see it. Then what? They want to get along, but they're too embarrassed to start talking?"

I nod.
I don't know about Tohsaka, but I know how Sakura feels.

Sakura likes Tohsaka, and she wants Tohsaka to like her.
Or she would never call her Nee-san.

"...I see. So Rin is clumsy, in spite of her appearance."
Impressed, Ilya murmurs and looks in the kitchen.


I follow her example and look in the kitchen.
They must be half done with the cooking.
Standing side-by-side in the small kitchen, Tohsaka and Sakura are making their dishes.



One holds the frying pan while the other holds the ladle, but neither says anything.
...And after a silence that even gets us nervous...

As expected from sisters, they start talking at the same time.

"What? Go ahead, I'll listen to whatever you have to say."
"Oh... um, it's really nothing. Didn't you want to say something?"

"...It's nothing. Well, different people cook differently, right? So I thought it might be useful if you can teach me some of your flavorings."
"Y-You're right. I'd love it if you could teach me your recipes, Tohsaka-Senpai."

"Hm."
"...That's it?  I don't believe this. At this rate, they'll be like that forever."

"......"
It's scary that I can't deny the possibility.
Tohsaka is normally dominant, but why is she so shy when it comes to Sakura?

And Sakura too.
She calls Tohsaka Nee-san when she's with me, but she's reserved when she's actually with her.

"Sakura."
"Huh? Oh, yes, what is it, Senpai?"
"I need to talk to you. Can you come here?"

"Senpai? Is there something outside?"
"No, being outside isn't the important part. I just wanted to talk secretly."

"Um... talk secretly...? Um, is this something you can't let Nee-san hear?"
"That's it. That's exactly what I want to talk about."

"...?"
"I'm talking about how you address Tohsaka. You don't call her Nee-san when you're with her. It's obvious that you really want to call her that."

"Ehyou mean it's obvious to Nee-san!?"
...Whoa.
I just made that up, but it seems Sakura is more reserved about her sister's feelings than I thought.

"N-No, Tohsaka doesn't know. I don't know why, but she's really dense when it comes to you. ...But in the worst case, she might think that you hate her."

"T-That's not true...! It's natural for Nee-san to hate me, but I'm happy to be with her.  I never even dreamed that we could make lunch together..."

"Right. Then why don't you just be honest with her? Even someone as dense as Tohsaka can't possibly miss it if you tell her straight-out. Then you should be able to..."
Sakura should be able to realize by herself that Tohsaka wants to get along with Sakura.

"...Um, Senpai?"
"It's nothing. Just go call Tohsaka Nee-san.
 I'll bet you she changes so much that it's funny."

"...Would it really turn out like that? I think having someone like me calling her 'Nee-san' will only bother her.
 I'm a magus of Matou, and I can't do everything like Nee-san can. Tohsaka-Senpai is probably disappointed that a failure like me is her sister."

"You idiot. Don't bring other things into a sister's relationship. You like Tohsaka, and she's your big sister, right?
 Then there's nothing more important than that. I'll guarantee it. There's mutual love between you two. To be honest, there's so much love that I'm a bit jealous."
"Eh... I-Is that so?"

"Yeah. So you call her Nee-san.
 I think Tohsaka believed in it, just like you did. So there's nothing to be scared of. It's for her sake too. Please call her Nee-san."
"For Nee-san's sake."

...I don't know what's going on in her mind.
But after putting her hands together, as if praying, and thinking it over...
"Okay. I'll do my best."
She smiles softly in thanks.

We return to the living room.
Sakura exchanges a glance with me, takes a deep breath, and heads to the kitchen.

"Welcome back. Sakura's tensed up. What happened?"
"Hm? The rest depends on her courage. Well, I'm sure it's going to go well."
"...?"
I sit down on the cushion.

"Nee-san. Can I finish this fried chicken?"
"Yes, all that's left is to fry it, so I'll leave it to you... wait, Sakura, did you just..."

"Okay. If I'm doing the chicken, can you cut the lettuce, Nee-san? I'll leave the serving to you."
"OOkay, that's fine, but..."

...Everything goes still.
They both fall silent, and the tension is much greater than before.


Not even breathing, they stare at one another.

"......Um, is it strange, Nee-san?"
 "Uhi-it's not that.  I was just surprised because I've never been called that way."
"...Then, um..."

"I-I have nothing against it. You're free to call me whatever you want, and I'm calling you by name. Well, it could get confusing because there are two Senpai here, so that should make things clearer."

Tohsaka makes it sound like it can't be helped and looks away.
...But Sakura should be able to tell that she's blushing and can't hide her smile.

...Their joint work got even more awkward after that.
They messed up so many times that lunch turned out to be a disaster. The fried chicken was covered in pepper, the mapo tofu was hot as hell, and the rice cooker was never turned on, so we ended up eating without rice.
But Tohsaka and Sakura both looked happy, smiling at every opportunity.

"...Geez, they sure are clumsy."
Ilya sounds dumbfounded as she eats mapo tofu that's hot enough to numb your tongue.
I nod back silently and gratefully eat the food they made.
"I'm coming in, Sakura."
He opens the door without waiting for a reply.
He has never waited for his younger sister's reply before opening this door.

"What, she's not home yet? What a slug."
He clucks his tongue and walks into the room.
Scratching at the wall, Matou Shinji wanders through his sister's room like a blind dog.

"Sakura. Are you in the basement again? What're you doing down there, ignoring me?"
He keeps asking questions that will not be answered.
There is no one in the room.
His sister has not been home the past few days.
It is obvious that the master of this room is not here, but Shinji wanders through it all the same.

"It's just like always. Haha, it really is like always!"
He throws the clock that touches his hand.
The sound of shattering glass is more annoying than he thought.

"Where the hell are you? Keeping a secret from your brother? Why the hell is everyone doing as they please...!?"
He starts throwing things like mad.
...This is like always too.
This outlet has been his daily routine for the past few years.
It is his best opposition that began three years ago when he found out the truth.

The Matou bloodline came to an end when he was born.

The noble family lost its power, becoming mere humans.
The only special thing is the accumulated knowledge.
The once noble family of magi is fated to perish in this Far East country.

He has known this since he was young.
The Matou family was a family that passed down secret techniques.
But it is all in past tense now.
As the Matou are no longer able to use magic, they are to blend into society as ordinary people.

But he did not think so.
Their Magic Circuit faded away, leaving them unable to perform their secret techniques.
The bloodline of magi ended for Matou in his father's generation, and he knows that he does not have the right to succeed the Matou name.
But the Matou family still has the records.
The bloodline perished, but the accumulated knowledge is not lost.

That itself is "special" enough for the boy.
He thinks he is different from others.
The Matou family have been chosen.
That will not change, even if they lose their power and cease to be magi.
He was proud of himself because he was born into a special family to be raised in a special way.
Even if he is a failure as a magus, he is a child born into the chosen family.

...But a new child slipped into the chosen family.
His father adopted a girl who had none of her own.
It all happened more than ten years ago.
The girl named Sakura became his little sister from that day on.

At first, he hated his new sibling.
He did not want any outsiders coming into the special Matou household.
But the boy started to accept his sister day by day.
The girl named Sakura was silent and ordinary, no more capable than a guard dog.
It is a waste of time to be hostile against someone like that, and it is more charming if one is to consider her a servant.

He looked through books, memorizing magic he could not use, to remind himself that he was the Matou heir.
He was the only one who could enter the study.
His adopted sister could never be named the successor, so she had no right to trespass there.
His sister would live as a normal human being, never being taught the family's surviving knowledge.
This fact greatly satisfied his pride.

A family of magi has only one successor.
He knew that, so he did not question their separate upbringings.
Only one could learn magic.
Then it was only natural that his sister be raised apart.

Yes.
He felt sympathy for his sister.
They lived in the same house and had the same parents, but he was the only one who could call himself special, and he pitied his sister for not being chosen.
It is like a compassion of a superior being looking down onto othersand it is his most reliable pride.

The brother treated his sister as a failure.
The sister feared her brother and always looked down, as if avoiding his gaze.
He thought it was because of shame, and he despised and loved her for it at the same time.
Until he found out the truth.

"What?"

That was all he could manage when he accidentally found the room.

A room he has never been told about.
Knowledge that was not taught to him.
Talent that was not given to him.
Everything was in the room.
A naked girl lay in the middle of the room.
Around her were swarms of black worms and his terrifying grandfather.
And his father glared at the boy as if he was a nuisance, an attitude he had never taken towards him.

And that ended it.
Everything he believed in, everything that constructed him was turned upside-down.

It was not him that was special.
It was not his sister that was kept at a distance.
It was not her that was pitiable.
And it was not her that was looking down on the other person

His life completely changed.
Since he no longer needed to hide anything, his father took a defiant attitude towards his son.  He started spending more time with the boy's sister instead.
His sister did not say anything, but would just hang her head like always.
She still acted as though running away from his gaze when she would say...
"I'm sorry, Nii-san."
...As if pitying him. She said it with the emotion that he once felt for his sister.

"HaHaha, hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!"

He laughed.
It was funny.
It was so funny that he wanted to kill.
The one he had thought was his pet was actually his master, and he was just a fool.
Which one is the funny one?
It must be both.
At that time, as he went back to the mansion with unsteady steps, he realized.

The world had not been turned upside-down.
It had been like this all along.
The inverted onethe one who was misunderstood was him.
It is just that he finally realized his own miserableness.

The three years after that were only pain for him.
His father died, and his grandfather only cared about Sakura.
Matou Shinji became just like air in his house.
He was treated as an object whose existence did not matter, and that truly was the case.

She pitied the air.
She apologized.
Though she never spoke the words aloud, she apologized every time she saw him.
She apologized for taking Matou Shinji's place.

   "Why are you apologizing?"

She could've just ignored him.
Then he wouldn't have hated her, wouldn't have clung to hope.
Sakura apologized.
Apologizing means submitting something.
Then

  "Then you're mine from now on."

Considering all the contempt he had endured, he saw nothing wrong in accepting this.

"Hahis she still over at Emiya's?
 Even though she's the successor of Matou. Even though she's the successor of Matou. Even though she's the successor of Matou!"

The room shows no signs of life.
But that is to be expected.
Matou Sakura's "room" is the underground worm's nest, and this is merely for show.
The master of the room does not care how much he breaks the things in this room.
This room is no different from the doorplate that hangs at the entrance.

"Yeah, but you still apologize...! 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'...!? Don't disobey me if you think you're sorry...! If you feel guilty, keep compensating for it! If you know you've been sold out to this house, be mine...!"
He scratches the sheets.
Something that was his.
Why did a doll that did not think or resist leave him?

"You took her. You took her, Emiya."
That was his miscalculation.
He knew she was attracted to Emiya Shirou.
That thing that held no interest in anything started to say things after getting to know him.
She gradually regained herself, and in the end, she betrayed him.

He trained her to never disobey him, but now she chooses a total stranger over her own brother

"That's why I said it wasn't safe to have her over at Emiya's. But that old bastard spouted some bullshit about keeping watch on that house!"
His grandfather does not even try to take Sakura back.
He said it is fine as is, and moreover, confined him to this house.

"You watch. I'm going to make you pay for this, Sakura. You should never disobey me"
...That's right.
If a doll is disobedient, he'll just reset the relationship to be like it was before.
If she gained hope to become human...

"...Yeah. I just have to destroy her hope again, just like before."
He laughs.
The clouded window reflects a face as ghastly as a skull.
It's afternoon now.
Tohsaka seems busy and Sakura's sleeping, so I should make dinner.
My left arm moves even though it reacts slow, so it shouldn't hinder me if I'm to make something simple.

"Hmm... I guess I can make fried swordfish and simmered meat and potato."
I check the contents of the refrigerator and decide the menu.
There are two additional people eating now, so the food gets used up quickly.
I should find some time to go to the shopping district tomorrow.

"Itadakimasu!"
Everyone must've liked having dinner ready when they came here, since they all seem to be in a good mood.

I'm worried that Rider isn't here, but I'm sure she has her reasons.
Her top priority is guarding Sakura. So maybe she has no intention of spending time around Tohsaka, who may end up being her enemy.

"...Will Rider come eat later on?"
I'll pack it up and take her some if she doesn't come.
Rider seems to like desolate places, so I bet she's either in the dojo or the shed.

"Oh, so you're good at this? Sakura's good at Western food and you're good at Japanese food?"

Tohsaka picks up the fried swordfish and looks at me in surprise.
It's golden fried with a scent of ginger, with an elegant soy sauce taste. She seems to really like it.

"I like this one better. I'm glad you're good at cooking."
Ilya eats the potatoes in satisfaction.
...It's unfortunate that she's only eating the "potato" part of the "simmered meat and potato", but I'm glad she likes it.

...Wait.
Sakura is tilting her head in confusion, chopsticks in hand.

"Sakura? What's wrong? You don't have any appetite?"
"...Oh... Um, I do, but Senpai?
 The simmered meat and potato doesn't have any sugar in it. It tastes strange."

"What!?"
I-I made such a stupid mistake on something I'm so used to cooking...!?

"Damn, hold on...!"
I serve myself out of the big dish in the center and try some.

"...Hm?"
.........That's strange.
This tastes normal.

"Sakura. Does this taste weird?"
"Weird? Didn't you use salt instead of sugar?
 I don't taste anything sweet..."

"Really? Isn't it supposed to taste this way? Well, it does taste different because there's something in it to bring out the flavor. But this is something you can't readily copy and make."
"I don't know since this is the first time I've had this dish, but it's good. It's sweet and easy to eat."

Sakura looks dissatisfied as she reaches out for seconds.
...One bite, two bites, three bites.
"Sakura...?"

"Huh? Oh, it seems I ate a piece that wasn't simmered. I'm sorry I said something weird. Your food is good like always."
Sakura smiles and keeps eating.

"............"
Sakura keeps eating like nothing happened.
I was worried by Sakura's odd behavior, but she seemed well enough after that.
In fact, she asked for seconds three times.
Sakura kept eating and finished off the food while Tohsaka stared at her in surprise.
It's past ten o'clock.
"It's about time. Let's get going, Shirou."
Tohsaka finishes preparing and appears.
"I know. Please watch the house while we're gone, Sakura."

Tohsaka and I head out to patrol the town as planned.
...It's stupid that this is our only measure against Zouken, but it's all we can do for now.

We need to defeat Zouken, Assassin, Saber, and the black shadow.
...They aren't ones we can defeat head on.
We have to sit tight until the countermeasure Tohsaka is preparing is completed.

But we can't just stay at my house.
According to the news this morning, Matou Zouken has started to attack ordinary people.
We can't match them right now, but we should at least patrol the town so that there won't be more victims.

"......"
"......"
We put our shoes on silently.
We know how dangerous it is to go out into town at night.
Zouken is only after Sakura, but we should get in his way if we're walking about.
...In the worst case, it'll be a repeat of our encounter in the forest.
Considering that, we can't be talking lightheartedly.

"...Hey. What are you doing?"
Then.
We don't have anything to spare, but Tohsaka glares at me and

"You don't need to see us off. Go back to your room, Sakura."
"......"
No, she's not glaring at me.
She's glaring at Sakura, who is standing in the hallway.

"N-Nee-san. I'll go too. It's dangerous for you two to go out alone, so..."
"Sakura."
...That must be why she's here.
I appreciate her concern. but our plan is already determined.

"No. You should know you're Zouken's target. Please stay here with Ilya and protect yourself."

"I know. But you can only use one arm, Senpai. And Nee-san doesn't have a Servant, so..."
"Don't be ridiculous, Sakura. It doesn't change the fact that you're our enemy. I can't trust you with my back when I don't know when you'll turn into Zouken's puppet."

"...But, Nee-san."
"You just concentrate on protecting yourself. If you feel sorry for us, please don't trouble us about this. Just let Rider protect you and Ilya."

"Tohsaka, youwhoa, hey...!"
"Hey, don't just stand there. Let's get going. While we stand around, he could be out there attacking somebody else."
Tohsaka grabs my hand and drags me outside.

"Ohjust be careful and watch the house, Sakura...! I'll leave Ilya to you...!"
I leave with Tohsaka pulling at me.

"........."
Sakura doesn't say anything and stands at the entrance, lonely.

"Hey, wait, Tohsaka! I'll follow you, so let go of me already!"
"Humph. It's your fault for being slow."
Tohsaka lets go and comes to a halt.

"...What's with that face? If you have something to say, then spit it out."
And it's like this all of a sudden.
Tohsaka is acting defiantly.
...Man.
If it bothers her that much, she shouldn't have said it in the first place.

"...Man. Then I'm saying it, Tohsaka. It's about what happened now, but don't say such things to Sakura. Sakura isn't like that because she wants to be."

"I know. But that's why I have to be firm with her. If we aren't, Zouken will be sure to take advantage."

"...This is a good opportunity, so let me straighten this out. I don't feel any sympathy towards Sakura.
 It doesn't concern me if she's Zouken's puppet, and I have nothing to do with what happened to her after she was adopted to the Matou family. It does no good for me to say anything about her problem."

"Tohsaka."
"Look. I'm at your house not because Sakura is there, but because you're there.
 My goal is not to save Sakura, but to obtain the Holy Grail.
 I'll keep watch on Sakura for that goal, and I don't care even if she hates me for it. That's why I'll say things like that, and I'm going to keep treating her as my enemy."

"...So it won't bother you at all if she hates you? Her feelings don't matter because she's a complete stranger?"
"That's right. Do you have any complaints?"
"You idiot. Of course I do."

...Man, this is not like Tohsaka.
She should be able to say it like it's nothing.  Instead, she's clenching her fists like she's trying to convince herself.

"All right. If you want to act that way, then go ahead.
 Sakura knows how you feel, no matter what kind of attitude you take towards her."

"Huhwhat do you mean by that!?"
"I'm talking about how important Sakura is to you. I'm an outsider and I notice it, so it should be obvious to her."

"That's a misunderstanding. I just..."
"There's nothing to misunderstand. People can't get seriously mad about things they don't care about. You're strict to Sakura for a reason. You don't say it, but she's still your precious sister."
"WWhat are you saying, you idiot!!? Stop saying such snobby things!!!!"

Tohsaka's face turns red with anger.
But I don't feel the usual intensity, and I know why.

"Oh? Was it a bother?"
"It is a bother. Isn't it obvious?"

"I see. Then while I'm at it, I have something else to say. I want you and Sakura to get along. She likes you, and you like her. So I don't like it when it's this awkward between you two."

"...Hey now. She has to be my enemy. Making friends with her now won't do any good.  I wouldn't even know where to start."
"Isn't it fine as is? Have confidence in yourself, Tohsaka. Even I can tell that you're being a good big sister."

"E-Enough with the chatting! We're going to the place they showed in the news this morning!"
Tohsaka looks away and starts to walk.
I reply to her absent-mindedly and follow.
Then.

"Shirou."
She calls my name without looking at me and...
"Um, thanks. That made me, um... happy."
Tohsaka grumbles, embarrassed.

...There's nobody at the central park.
The park that's deserted even during the day is even quieter after the murder yesterday.
The park is not a place for relaxation within the business district, and it is no different from a desert in an uncultivated land.

"...A murder, huh? It seems people are treating it as an accident rather than a murder case. Well, I guess you really can't call it murder when you can't tell who died and what the missing body parts are."

I still see traces of blood on the grass.
...It looks like a bucketful was spilled in four separate areas.
The darkened patches have some distance between them, probably because the victims frantically tried to escape.

"Tohsaka. You said this might be Zouken's doing, but what do you think now? Do you still think so after coming here?"

"......Let's see. I thought it might be the black shadow's doing, but it doesn't seem that way.
 All the mana in the area would be swallowed if that thing had appeared. But the magical energy here isn't exhausted. ...Well, I still think the incident here was an unexpected meal."

That's all the information we can get out of this place.
Tohsaka and I leave the site of the tragedy behind us.

...We didn't find anything in Shinto.
Maybe Zouken is not active tonight, probably because the incident yesterday was so vivid.

The date's about to change.
A riverside breeze blows as we trudge home.
And...
"Tohsaka. Sakura is the successor of Matou, right?"
I suddenly feel like asking the question that was on my mind for a while.

"Why are you asking that now? I have nothing to hide."
"No, that's not what I meant. If she's the successor, that means she's a magus, right? So I'm wondering what kind of magic she uses."
"Oh, I see now."

"...Yeah, I hear Matou's magic is in bindings and coercions. I also hear that the Command Spell wouldn't have been possible without Matou."

"Oh. So Sakura's magic is restriction? But then..."
On that day...
The magic Sakura used when the crest worm tortured her must have been Rider's power.

"......I don't think it's restriction. That's the Makiri's forbidden magic, and it's not their strong point.
 But it's meaningless to think about it. Sakura doesn't have the magical energy to use magic. The crest worm will feed on such excess energy first, so she shouldn't be able to use magic."

"...I see, that's good. So, how good is Sakura in your eyes? Is she about as good as you, considering she's the Matou successor?"
"We have about the same number of Magic Circuits.
 Did you forget that we're sisters?"

"Oh."
That's right.
That's why they wanted to adopt her in the first place.

"Oh, so she's about as good as you?"
"I don't think so. My attribute is 'five elements', and hers is 'imaginary element'. But the Matou family has a water attribute, so they changed her by force. What do you think would happen to a bird that has a potential to fly if it's put in water?"

"It'll die, or..."
"Yes. Adapting to the water would be all it could do.
 She would've had great success as a magus of Tohsaka, but she's no different from you because she was forced to change into a magus of Matou.
 No, you're much stronger than her because you train your body."

"Then let's say you and Sakura fought using magic..."
"I'd win ten times out of ten.  With her magical energy capacity, Sakura would never get past my barrier."

...I see.
I couldn't figure out what kind of magus Sakura is, but I got to know their power balance.
Tohsaka isn't one to bluff, so she must be speaking the truth.

"...But I'm embarrassed. I never knew Sakura was a magus, and I don't know how good she is. I'm a dumbass for pretending to be her guardian all this times."
"Hey now. The crest worm eats the magical energy in her, so you'd never know she's a magus even if you're by her all the time."

"...And she did her best not to let you know. So don't say such a thing in front of her, okay?"

"............"
She doesn't even need to tell me.
Sakura is Sakura, even if she is a magus.
First of all, I'm not that skillful.
No matter who Sakura may really be, I can only treat her like I always have.

"You're right. If you say so, I'll just treat her the same as always.
 I won't even think about asking for her help as a magus. That's fine with you, right?"

"Of course. If you were going to rely on Sakura, I would've taken her to my house."

Tohsaka's kindness makes my heart jump.
...See.
Tohsaka really is a good sister.

"But I don't think that's possible. Sakura smiles when she's at your house. If you talk about surprising, that's what surprised me the most."
Then.
A look of happiness on her face, she says something odd.

"Smile? But Sakura, is, um..."
She's always like that.

"Yeah, it was needless worry on my part.
 I can't talk to her that much, so I watched her. I went to the archery club every day after she started coming to our school."

"Yeah, I know that, but..."
"...Yeah. And I realized after a while that she never smiled."


That's...
...Something I'm hearing for the first time, but I can't deny what she's saying.
Come to think of it, Sakura always looked gloomy at school.

"Well, the only exception was when you were there.
 She smiled whenever you came to the archery club.
 In short, Sakura's only cheerful when you're in front of her."

"......"
Her words should make me happy.
But...
"...Sakura doesn't smile in front of people?"
...They seem to hide a dangerous truth.
It's past one o'clock when I return to my room.

"Phew."
I sit down on my futon.
Our patrol yielded nothing.
All we did was confirm that this morning's news was real.

"......"
Enemies we must defeat.
Just thinking about them sends cold, nauseous feelings through me.

Even a human could match Zouken or Assassin.
But those two are different.
I don't even know if the black shadow has a concept of death, and Saber is someone we don't even stand a chance against.
Butas long as there are victims, we can't just ignore them saying we can't beat them.

"...Archer's arm, huh?"
I put my hand on the red cloth.
...I have a weapon.
I don't know how far this will get me, but I do have a weapon.
The question is if I can manage it, and if my body can withstand it.

".........I guess a bit is fine."
I untie the knot on the red cloth.
The cloth loosens up, and blood flows into my arm.

    At that instant.
    I think I heard a beast's howl.

I'm stabbed.
My whole body is pierced.
Is this pain? If this is pain, then the pain I've experienced until now isn't pain.

It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.
The floor's ruggedness. The softness of the futon hurts. It feels like I'm sitting on a mountain of swords. The air is poisonous, and I die three times as I breathe it in. Birds are chirping in the distance. The wind is strong. There's no moisture. My skin dries and turns into sand. Flowing, scouring, crumbling.

Tongs are inserted from the hollowed holes.
Thirty-two enter where my shoulder used to be.
They carefully, accurately, and elaborately pierce my internal jugular vein, trachea, spinal cord, sympathetic nervous system, lobus superior pulmonis, lobus medius pulmonis dextri, lobus inferior pulmonis, main artery, heart, diaphragm, spleen, stomach, liver, gall bladder, and colon.

"Ah!"
It's crumbling.
Time slows to an impossible crawl. 
I see sixty-trillion cells crumbling apart at the rate of three four naught per second.

", "
There is no pain.
There is no pain.
There is no pain.
There is only fear.
The end roll invades with amazing speed.
The flashback stops with fantastic image.
Death before my eyes, death past me, death at the moment, the pain is not physical, but only the explosion of negation every time death is thrown at me
"Haa, ah.........!"
...I hear a sound.
The sound of my head striking the floor.

"AhAh."
...My eyes are hot.
I realize I've been crying.

"AhAhh, ah."
Desperately, I stifle the scream building in my throat.
I curl up, push my head against the floor, grab my left arm with my right hand, and just cry.

"AhAhh, ah"
I'm scared.
The thing I've been missing since the fire ten years ago.
I'm scared.
A natural fear for any living thing.
I'm scared.
For the first time in my life, I want to run away from my end.

"Haaaa."
It's not because dying will hurt.
It's not because I want to live.
It's just because it fills me with dread.

"Ah...... Kuh."
I tie up the red cloth.
I tie the knot tight, so that it'll never come loose again.

"No. This isn't good."
I groan and cry.
The priest said I'll die if I use my left arm.
That's nonsense.
I'll die if I take this cloth off.
My body might be able to bear it, but my mind will die.

My consciousness crumbled away when I loosened the cloth and my shoulder touched the outside air.
I could not bear it.  I cannot live without this cloth.

No.
If this arm is a contradictory existence that people should not associate with, 
 my body, its death foretold, runs to the terminal station, 
the ship, with a crack in the bilge, can only sink into the ocean depths, 
the passengers unaware, too late for anything

".........Ah"

    My breath is running wild.

"Ah, guh."

    I had a bad dream.

...I wipe the sweat off my forehead.
I can't stand up.
I stay cowered, bearing the strange pain.

"Ugh"
...I can't remember.
My left arm hurts.
It hurts so much that I want to cut it off.
I try to recall why it hurts, but I can't remember how to recollect anything in the past.

"Hm"
The pain goes away.
I gather up my consciousness.
It must be because I was asleep.
The dispersed memories look as if they can be cooked nicely, just like chopped onions.
See, I can add color with soy sauce, add flavor with pepper, and add some potato starch to complete the dish.

"Whoathat sounds nasty."
I murmur to myself.
My head is good for nothing, but I can still manage to come up with a conclusion.
In short, I don't have to eat something that's not good.

My left arm is already gone.
Nobody relies on something that's not there.
Therefore, Emiya Shirou has no weapon.
This foreign body is something I must suppress using all my life, and will contaminate me for the rest of my life.

".........!"
Suppressing it with the cloth is meaningless.
If I want to rid myself of this poison, there is only one way.
", "
But I still hold on to my left arm.

A gun is pointed at my forehead.
An image of a trigger.
The trigger is my left arm.
Once pulled, the gun will fire, blowing my brains from my skull.

"......"
I shudder.
I hold my breath and stare at the white wall.

"........."
Clutching my arm, I lie down.
...I close my eyes.
My whimpering finished, I decide to get some sleep for tomorrow.
...A small sound.
I awaken to the sound of footsteps.


I wake up my dozing mind.
It's almost two o'clock.
...It hasn't even been thirty minutes since I fell asleep.
I get up, still unconsciously holding on to my left arm.

"Sakura."
Outside the room.
I call out to the hallway where the footsteps came from.
It's not that I know who's there.
I just thought Sakura might be there.

"..........."
......The door opens.
Sakura steps through into my room.


Biting her lip in embarrassment, she looks down as if unsure of what to say.

"......I'm sorry, Senpai. I, again..."
Sakura apologizes.

But I'm the one who should apologize.

The reason why Sakura's here.
I know well enough the pain she has to go through.
The crest worm feeds on her magical energy, so Sakura periodically needs to receive more from a magus.

"I'm sorry. I should've gone to see you as soon as I came home. I'm sorry for making you suffer."

I get up.
...What was I thinking?
I was so caught up with my left arm that I forgot about Sakura. I can't be forgiven even if I apologize.

"Um, Senpai...?"
"Yeah, I want to make love to you, if that's all right with you."
I use my left arm to pull her to me.
I want to take the lead to make up for forcing her to come to me.

"Ohwhoa."
"S-Senpai...!? Are you all right...!?"
"Oh, it's nothing. I just felt a bit dizzy."

Damn, that's pitiful!
I unconsciously used my left arm and was reminded of the pain.
Still, it shouldn't hurt so long as I have the cloth on, so what am I frightened about?

"...Oh, I have to take my clothes off. Can you take yours off too, Sakura?"
I shake off the dizziness and look at her.
...Then.

"Oh... S-Senpai...! I have a suggestion...!"
I don't know if she's happy or nervous, but Sakura says something strange.

"...? Suggestion?"
"Oh, yes. You're tired from the patrol, right?"

"............Hm."
...How should I answer?
I can't deny it because I really am tired, but I'm not tired enough to not have sex with Sakura.
Actually, I want to have sex even if I am tired.

"...Um, I'm tired. I'm tired, but I still want to make love to you.
 So you don't have to be concerned about me.
 ...Well, you came all the way here, so don't stop now."

I'm ready to go.
I'll be troubled all night if Sakura stops now.

"Yes, so I have a suggestion. I'm sure you're tired, so let me start off."
"?"
Sakura smiles.
I nod, even though I have no idea what she's talking about.


I gulp.
...At Sakura's request, I'm still standing.
...On the other hand...
Sakura is naked and on her knees in front of me.

"...Hm... It's already hard"
"...Sakura, are you really-"
"...Yes. It's all right, Senpai. I can make you feel good."
Sakura takes my half-erect dick and gently holds it up.

I feel her breath on my crotch.
"!"
My dick expands.
I get nervous and excited.
I never thought I'd feel Sakura's breath on my penis.

    "Hm... Ah."

Sakura's tongue touches my half-erect penis.
"...Ah... Hm, mm, mm..."
Something rough touches my head.
A needle-like sensation lances into me from the tip.
She only licked me, but it feels like she's caressing my whole back.

"Ah, ha... hm, hm... hm, how is it, Senpai...?"

......She doesn't need to ask...!
Sakura traces my penis with her tongue, as if savoring the taste.
Her tongue crawls across my member.
Feeling the faint sensations, it instantly arches up.

"Kya...! Oh... it's so hard..., hm... I have to hold on to it..."
My meat stands erect, almost touching my navel.
But Sakura takes it and pulls it down.
She gently grasps it with her slender fingers and puts the head in her mouth.

"Hm... kuh, hm...! Ah, hm, ah, it's so big... hm... my mouth is numb..."
Sakura's tongue rolls around my tip as if licking on something sweet.

"!"
I can't hold it back and I start to let out my pre-cum.
"Ah... You're starting to feel good, Senpai... Hm, hm, nn, ah"
She drinks it down.
Sakura licks my urethra and moves her tongue carefully over my head.

The juice keeps spilling from me.
She licks behind my shaft, my head, and even my rims.

"Hmm... ku, hm... fu, hm..."
...I'm already hard.
My nervousness is gone now.

"Ahnit twitched again... Aha... It feels good, right...?"

She licks it with familiarity.
Her lips press against my tip.
Her fingers gently stroke my sensitive genitals.
Her thick tongue tickles me, but stimulates me at the same time.

"!"
My penis enlarges in response to Sakura's tongue.
It stands fully erect, clear liquid dripping from it.
And...

"Ah, hm, haa...! Oh, it's so much... It's like it's crying... it's so"
'Cute'.
Sakura kisses and drinks from it.

"Hm... hm... ah, hm"
She gulps audibly.
The stimulation from her red tongue doesn't cease.
"...Hm, fu, ah, is it here, Senpai...?"
...This is how Sakura feels towards me.
She caresses me with sweet kisses.
She touches me as if touching something dear and tender.

"Ah, fu... Yes, I'll do my best... so... please feel better..."
Her touch is not intense, but full of deep affection.

"...Sakura..."
There's no way her careful movements wouldn't feel good.
Sakura doesn't move her face because she's only licking the tip.
Her hot breath hits my fired member.

"...Ha... Nha, ha... Haa, hm..."
Her ragged breaths.
Sakura breathes, her shoulders moving up and down.
The slight movement causes her large breasts to shake.

Her soft touch, her sensual body.
Heat starts to gather in my testicles.

"Hm...! ...You're feeling good, right? Hm, it's moving... Aha, it's like it's alive."
She laughs innocently.
...Did she feel my desire?
She runs a finger playfully along the vein.

"Heythat's..."
"Oh...? You don't like it...? ...Fufuthen I'll do this."
She pushes on my shaft, making rhythmical sounds.
She pushes her fingers as if pushing on a pressure point.

"Kuh"
The soft pleasure takes a sudden change.
"Amazing... There's more... ahh, hm... hm..."
...Sakura licks up the juice with her tongue.
In its place, her saliva drips down her lips.

"AhnI'm getting wet. Hm, hm... Is this better for you...?"
Sakura wipes it with her hands and uses it to wet my member.
She takes her slick hand and slides it across my shaft.

"Ah!"
The sensation.
My penis is wet with liquid from Sakura's mouth.

"Am... hm, fuh... Hm, hmm... Ahh... hm..."
Sakura licks it and kisses my head.
"Hm, uh...... Nha, ah, fuh...!"
Maybe she can't breathe out her mouth because it's filled with my penis.
Air blows out of her nose and along my organ.

"......Sakura, I"
I want to let it out.
Sakura's only sucking the tip, so the stimulation isn't that strong.
It's a nice sensation, and my body could bear it if I wanted to.

"Hm, ah, Senpai...?"
"Ha!"
But my mind is at its limits.
"Sakura, I..."
I reach out to her shoulders.

"Hm... You're coming, Senpai? ...Please leave it to me... I'll let you finish off."
She puts the tip in her mouth.
"!"
She surrounds my tip, lightly nibbles on it, and gives me the stimulation I want.

"HmHm, mm......!"
She sucks hard.
Her tongue rolls around the rim.
The rough top of her tongue and the slippery bottom of her tongue attack me continuously!

"...! No, Sakura, I'm coming...!"
"Hm, okay... Please let it out, Senpai"
Sakura pulls her mouth away.
I'm about to explode.
She grabs the root of my shaft and squeezes the cum out of me.

"!"
"HmHm, hm"
My cum surges out.
Sakura opens her mouth and catches my cum.

"...Ha, ahit's still coming out... hm... You're still hard, Senpai"
Her fingers slide across my shaft.
She strokes it, trying to squeeze out what's left inside.

"Ah..."
"Hm... hm... Did it feel good, Senpai...?"
Sakura drinks my cum with an expression of ecstasy.
...She looks lascivious and beautiful at the same time.
The thick liquid drips down her chin and her breasts.
Smiling, she lets it run down her body.

"Sakura."
It's not enough.
I want to drive Sakura crazy.
"Hm......... Senpai...?"
I grab her hand and pull her to my futon.

"Let's continue. I want to put it in you so that I can feel you."
I embrace her hot body.

"...Okay. If you're doing it, Senpai."
Sakura leans against me, accepting my offer.
...My penis is still rock hard.
My lusts won't go away with just one orgasm.
I can only think about following my instinct and piercing it in Sakura.

"Eh...? On top of you...?"
"Yeah, you're doing it today, right? Just spread your legs and move yourself."

I lie down and have Sakura come on top of me.
I didn't have anything specific in mind.
I just thought I'd be able to connect deeper with her this way.

".........Um, like this...?"
Sakura puts her knees on the floor and sits over my crotch.
Sakura looks like she feels awkward being on top, but all that's left is to drop her body.

"...Um, Senpai. I..."
"It's all right. I won't do anything until you get comfortable. You can move at your own pace."
".........Okay. If you say so."
Sakura nods uneasily and slowly lowers herself.

"Hmm, it's here, right...?"
She takes ahold of me and guides me into her.
The tip touches her slit with a wet sound.
She must be aroused already.
It's so wet that there's no need to caress it.

"Ah!"
She holds my penis and pushes it into her.

"Ha, ahnha......!"
She must not be able to adjust her height, as half my penis is inserted in one breath.

"Sakura, put your strength in your legs."
I grit my teeth and try to bear the sudden pleasure as I direct Sakura.

"Oh, yes... You're right..."
She must be nervous, as her walls are different from before.
They still wrap warmly around me, but they don't squeeze.
It seems Sakura doesn't have the composure to concentrate on her hips.

"Sakura...? You have to lower yourself."
"...Oh, okay..."
But she doesn't.
She just looks away awkwardly.

 "What's wrong? Is there a reason you can't?"
"U-Um... It's because... you can see everything in this position..."

That's what's causing Sakura to get nervous.
Embarrassment and hesitation.
She caressed my penis so intently, but it seems having her vagina seen is embarrassing.

"It's fine. I want to see everything.
 I got into this position so that I can feel you the most."
I reach out.
I wrap my arms around her waist so that I can ease her nervousness.

"......! Y-You said you won't move, Senpai...!"
"Yeah, I won't move if you do it. Come on, lower your hips if you don't want me to move."
"......Hm... You're mean, Senpai."
Sakura sighs and closes her eyes as if to bear the embarrassment.

"...Hm... Ahh... ah, hm...!"
She slowly lowers herself.
As she said, I can see everything from here.

Sakura's weight causes my penis to penetrate deeply into her.
I can clearly see her slit and her clit showing underneath her pubes.
It's wet between us, and she's overflowing with her desires.

"Hm... This is certainly embarrassing. Did you have an orgasm back then?"
"Ah... ah... No...! I-I only started feeling good after being in this position...!"

She gives a cute excuse as she keeps lowering herself.
She must have wanted it so bad that she can't stop herself now.

"Ha, hm...! No, Senpai's looking, but I want it in deeper"
Her knees completely bend.
Sakura's soft butt touches my thighs.

"Ah... ha... hm, haa... ah... It's all in, Senpai"

Is it painful to have all of it inside?
Sakura breathes out and tries to bear the foreign substance within her.

"...All right. Then lift yourself up now. Keep moving until you get used to it."
"...Hm... All right. I'll keep moving, Senpai."
She slowly lifts herself.
My penis is gradually exposed to the outside air.

"...Haa... Haa, haa, ah...!"

It doesn't take long for Sakura's body to accept it.
She moves up and down.
The slow movement slowly speeds up.

"Fua, ha, hm! Haa... Senpai, this is scary...!"
...Sakura's breaths heat up along with her body.
Her figure.
A woman is shaking while breathing heavily.
Just watching Sakura's voluptuous body pours gasoline onto the flames of my desire.

"!"
I'm beginning to forget about my promise not to move until Sakura gets used to it.
But my penis pulsates before anything.

"Ah, ha...! Ah, it's hitting me, it's coming in, ha, fua!"
My meat pushes inside of her.
As its arched back, it pushes up on her stomach.
"Hm... Ah, my stomachah, hah...! Amazing, it's so full...!"
She must like it as she starts to move faster.

"Kuh... haa...! Ah... ahh...! Hm, it's deeper than before...!"
"Guh"
She'll pull me in at this pace.
My reasoning will be burned by Sakura's hot walls.

"Ah... hah, ahh...! It's heavy, and I can't stop my butt...!"

This position gives me too much pleasure.
My penis goes in and out like last time, but the sensation is different.
Is it because she's on top of me?
Sakura's body is more sensual than last time, and she seems to be wetter.

"Sakura"
The feel of her weight on me is so lovely that I reach out unconsciously.

"Hm... Your hand, Senpai...!"
I cover her breasts with my hands.

"I'm so gladplease touch them... Please squeeze them, touch them as you like...!"
Her breasts are soft, yet firm.
Letting my male instincts take over, I dig my fingers into her breasts and fondle her hard nipples with my thumb.

"Hya...! Ah, mm!"
Her body arches back.
I circle her areola and roll her nipples between my fingers.
"Haa... ah, haa... Do my breasts feel good...?"
Her pink nipples grow still harder.
Sakura's body grows even hotter.

"Ah, hm...! Ah, it feels good...! Please feel it, Senpai!"
Her butt moves in a rhythm.
...The love juice starts to fill the air with an obscene smell.
My crotch is damp with her fluids, dripping down with every movement.

"...Ah, haa, ahno, Senpaii can't hold it any longerI can't stop my hips...!"
Sakura puts her hands down on my chest.
Her walls were only accepting me until now.
But suddenly, it's like it was the last time.

"Kuh...!?"
She undulates inside.
The honey pot that only accepted me until now suddenly starts to attack the foreign body.

The numerous walls surround me, entangle me, and suck on me.
It's moving in a complex manner, but it still only gives me pleasure.
It reminds me of a carnivorous plant, slowly digesting its prey.

"Hm, fua, ah.. mm, ah...! Ahh... this is good...!"
"Sakura..."
Sakura's hair tosses as she moans.
Her love juice helps the rubbing friction, urging to move faster.

"Kuh...!"
"Ah... hm...! Amazingit's driving into me...!"

", "
I'm pushing my hips up before I know it.
Did Sakura drive me to do it, or did she start to go crazy because I started to push my hips up?
We move apart and collide like magnets.

"Ah, hm, ahh...! Ahh, ahh, oh, ah, haa...!"
Sakura's body shakes in response to the thrusts.
She takes it with all her body, begging for me to go deeper still.

The tip hits the ceiling.
The wet walls protest, but accept me, and the hundreds of walls caress the tip.

"Ah, ahh...!!! It's deep in me...!
 You're deep in me!"

"Guh!"
The semen reaches my urethra, waiting for its release.
If I can, I want to let it all out.
Not only my semen, but every liquid within my body.

"Ah, ah"
It's abnormal.
She feels too good.
Her body sucks on me, as if trying to devour my whole penis.
The pleasure is limitless.

"AhAh, haa!! I can't put power in my body... Senpai, I can't stay up, ahh, haa...!"

"Sakura...!"
I support my falling body with my hands.
I can't bear it either.
I can't bear it, but I can hold on a bit.
Sakura's calling out to me, so I want to finish together.

"AhI'm gladyou're coming inSenpai, I'm glad, I'm glad, Senpai...!!!!"
For as long as Sakura calls out to me, I'll love her.
Until I break apart.

I push up.
I ram myself into her to respond to her call.

"Haa, ahh, kuh, ah! Haa, it's good, please thrust it in, Senpai...!"

Our minds melt together.
Her breasts shake with our movements.
It must be because Sakura is up on her knees.
Sakura is bracing herself with her legs.
So she's putting strength into her sphincter, causing her walls to squeeze me harder than before.

"Ah, it's gonna rip...! Senpai, ahh, ah, hm, ahh!"
...Sakura isn't moving anymore.
I'm the one doing the thrusting.
I thrust so hard that I might break her.

My urge to ejaculate is already over the limit.
I can't hold it back with my will anymore.
It should already be over.
But my ejaculation is held back.
I'm not bearing it, but something's holding it back as I keep thrusting into Sakura.

"No, ha, no, ahh, noI'm gonna go crazy... Senpai... More, Senpai...! Ahhh, ahh, fua, haa!!!!"

The pleasure just keeps accumulating.
The light of pleasure almost fries my brain.
But I still lust for Sakura.

"Nha, haa...! More, Senpai...! Please break me more, ah, I love you, ah, you're breaking me, ah, this is like a dream, I always wanted you to embrace me, SenpaiSenpai, Senpai, Senpai......!!!"

"Haa, ah, ah!"
Which one of us is broken?
It feels like she's sucking up my energy.

It's similar to something...

It doesn't matter.
I don't care.
Sakura is the only thing I care about right now.

"Come, haa, nhaa...! Yes, ah... deeper...! Don't let me go, no, Senpai, I don't want to let go...!"

My sensations run wild.
My sanity escapes into oblivion.
Yes, I'm crazy.
Then why not forget about things I don't want to think about: my tired body, Sakura's perverted actions, my left arm that I want to cut off

"HaSakuraSakura, Sakura, Sakura...!"
Cracks run across my vision.
The thing that held me back starts to disappear.

"Ahh...! Ah, haa, haI'm coming, no, I'm gonna come before you...! TogetherSenpai, Senpai, come together with me!"
"Yeahme too...!"

The urge to ejaculate.
It's about to unload everything from the very root.
"Hm, ahah, Senpai!"
I slam my cum into her pussy along with my penis.

"Ahhm, ah......"

Her walls convulse.
In a trance, Sakura strokes her stomach, filled with my cum.

"......Hm...... I have to take all of it"
How conscious is she?
My cum flows out of her slit, dripping down indecently.
"...Oh... No, it's flowing out..."
Sakura squeezes, as if unwilling to let it go.

"!"
My penis convulses and lets out what is left inside.
...And I'm done.
My penis loses its power, turns flaccid, and stops pushing apart Sakura's vagina.

"Ah......... Haa........."
I somehow manage to keep my sanity while the pleasure assails me.
...I push her waist and let myself out.
"Ohit's out..."
A shudder runs through her.

Sakura takes a deep breath, and...
"Fuaa... I reached orgasm, Senpai"
She falls onto my body.

My reasoning disappears.
My energy is gone, and I released all of my magical energy.

"Ah!"
...The power in my mind turns off.
I can't think of anything.
I can't recall what happened tonight, the pleasure that was only pain.

"This is just like"
It's like it was a dream.
...I fall into a deep sleep.
My tired body forgets about the fact that Sakura came to this room, the uneasiness in my mind, what happened tonight, and...
...I go back to the light sleep I was having an hour ago.
It is in a red sea.

The familiar scenery is submerged in seawater, turning the town into an aquarium.
Instead of air, something thick flows into the throat.
The more it gasps for breath, the more of the heavy, watery substance it sucks in.
So this has to be underwater.

It gasps out that it is painful.
It originally lived on land. It cannot possibly live underwater.
It tries to reach the surface, and it eventually reaches the highest place in the town.
The suffocation does not abate.
It looks down at the town, lungs burning from lack of oxygen, and curses the peacefully sleeping townspeople.

It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.
There's no air here.
There's no pain here.
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.
It drags corpses behind it.
Its body is bright red with blood.
It hurts. It hurts. Need more. It hurts.

In its black hands are many corpses.
The distorted hands grasp many dead bodies.

      Need more. Need more. Need more. Need more.

It smashes them, dyeing itself red.
Need more air.
The air hurts.
The water pressure is uncaring.
The water pressure is unbearable.
It smears the red blood all over its body.
It probably thinks that the blood is the only watertight protection it has to live in this water.

It reaches out its twisted hands.
Illuminated by the moon, the dark hand becomes a giant shadow and descends to crush the town

"Ah......!"
She wakes up.
She's breathing hard from her restless sleep.
Astonished by the dream's realism, she hugs her feverish body.
At that instant...
Her hands are wet with blood.

"Ah, ah!"
She shuts her eyes and pulls her hands away.
...But when she looks again, they are clean.
Although she knows it was just a hallucination, she can't stop trembling.

She trembles.
She trembles like a broken machine.
She trembles so violently that bolts might spill from her ears.
All the parts in her body will spill out like thatand the image is so frightening that she cannot stop trembling.

"My face. Yeah, I have to go wash my face"
She heads to the bathroom.
She makes it only a few steps.
Her quaking limbs will not follow her orders.
She braces herself against a desk.

"...Ah... Ah"
Her vision wavers.
She can't make it to the door.  She can't even see it clearly.
She can't remember what kind of a dream she was having, or why she got out of bed.

"...Ugh... Ah."
She's broken.
She can't remember anything.
She can't think of anything.
There is nothing but lust and hunger.
She wants hot skin, breath, sensation, penis, semen, and kind words.
Her empty but mushed-up insides plead for more sex.

"Ahuh."
She lies on the desk and shakes her head.
Fear and infinite self-hatred.
Something is wrong.
Why hasn't she had enough?
A few hours ago, she was loved, just like in her fantasies, but it hasn't filled her up at all.
It felt great, and she thought there could be no greater happiness, but she's not the least bit satisfied.

She's probably empty, and that's why he alone cannot fill her up.
But she doesn't want anyone else.
She wants to be his for much longer.
She wanted it at the cost of time, emotion, and other people, so why didn't she do so? And she naturally realizes that she can eliminate all the things she just thought about.

"Oh"
She feels dizzy.
It's not so far-fetched.
What's scary is that...
She really thought that it would be fun.

"Ahuh... ugh...!"
She leans on the desk.
She keeps her collapsing body steady.
The frightening dream becomes clearer every day.
The frightening dream becomes less frightening every day.
She is breaking down.
Until now, it was only her body.
But now, she is beginning to go mad.

"...Uh... uh, ugh."
Moans escape her mouth.
Her vague memory is no problem.
It doesn't matter if she cannot remember what happened a few hours ago.
She's not scared of being in bed forever.

She is terrified of becoming something else.
She doesn't want to become a bad person.
If she slowly breaks down like this, she will go crazy in the end.
She will probably become something that will cause him the most trouble.


That's what terrifies her.
It's scary to go crazy. It's more scary than anything else.
If she does, he will not touch her, nor will he love her.
She won't be able to be with him.  She won't even know if she is with him.
Not only that. If she loses her mind, he will be with another woman.

She doesn't want that. She really doesn't want that.
She always thought he should be with someone else, someone better suited to him, but she can no longer accept that.

    Because...
    He is already hers.

...That's why it's frightening.
She's scared of what she might do.

"...Ughuh, kuh"
She knows, yet there's no salvation.
She cannot tell him of this disfunction.
If she tells him, it will be back to the cold for her.
She cannot return to the cold now that she has known warmth.
She wants to...
Keep smiling at him.

But she knows what will be lost if this continues.
Her wish is just a desire.
She wishes for one person's happiness, yet her happiness requires the ruin of that same person.

If she cannot do so, she should just break down and disappear.
If she's going to go crazy, she should disappear now and become a monster in a place with no people.
That should be the best choice.

But she still clings to it.
She wishes for more because it's warm and happy here.
So why?
Why is such a normal desire forbidden to her?

"NoNo, no, no, no...!"
She shakes off her weakness.
She's not envious.
She's not holding any grudges.
She justifies her decision, saying that she merely wants to stay here.

"Nothis isn't me."
She shakes her head in denial.
She shuts her dark mind with an empty head.
There are no happy endings.
She turns her eyes away from the obvious conclusion.

"Ughuhh, ugh"
...Her hazy mind is already experiencing another nightmare.
Forcing down her wish to be saved, she keeps on crying.

"So. First off, how's your arm doing, Shirou?"
Tohsaka cuts right to the chase when I get to the dojo.

"Well, I can move it fine. But that's not what you're asking me, right?"
"Right. I'm asking you if you understand Archer's arm."
Ilya is watching us silently.


...I swear Tohsaka doesn't know what this arm is.
She doesn't know about the fear I felt last night.
It'll be over for me if I take this cloth off.
She doesn't know my body will be destroyed if I let this arm free, let alone use it.

I recall the sensation.
Unavoidable death.
It felt like being buried alive.
Utter obliteration, where the world is covered beneath something mysterious and ends in silence.

After just a glimpse of it, my mind repeated to itself in terror...
That I cannot use this arm.
I'll die if I use it.
Without some sort of miracle, I will definitely die.

"How is it? It's been a day since I transplanted my crest, so it should be working now.
 Answer me. Do you know what you can do with Archer's arm?"

"?"
...Hold on.
Tohsaka's question is not exactly what I'd been expecting.
I thought she wanted to know if I could use the arm.

"Um... so you're not asking me if I can suppress his arm, but if I know what his Noble Phantasm is?"

"O-Of course! It'll be terrible if you use Archer's arm, so there's no way I'm going to let you! Or what!? Were you thinking about using it!?"
Oh.
Tohsaka's seriously angry.

"Uh... No, but I thought that's where the conversation was going..."
"What are you talking about!?"

"...Geez. Let me tell you. I forbid you to use Archer's arm, no matter the situation.
 And don't even consider using it without my permission.
 ...Um, you're taking Archer's place, so it'll trouble me if you die."


Tohsaka's serious.
...I take back what I said earlier.
She knows.
She's a much better magus than I am.
She knows more than me about what'll happen if I free this arm.

"So, how is it? Do you understand what Archer's Noble Phantasm is?"
She repeats the question.
I don't know what kind of an answer Tohsaka is expecting, but...
"Geez. Why don't you just tell her, Shirou? That you knew what it is since his arm has been transplanted."

"Wait, is that true, Shirou?"
"Ughwell, I think so. Archer's Noble Phantasm is his projection magic, and it's reproducing weapons, right?"

I have a vague idea, but I can't be sure, so I'm still half in doubt.

"...I guess I didn't need to be so nervous. So, you're already connected to it.
 That's helpful in its own way, but why didn't you say anything, Ilya? If Shirou knew about Archer's projection magic, I didn't even need to ask him."

"You didn't ask. You're the one who wants Shirou to do projection, so it's your role to ask. It's nothing I should butt in on."

"What's that? Are you going to say we're stopping after all that preparation?"

"That's for you two to decide.
 You'll certainly win if you can reproduce the gem sword. That's why I gave you a hand. But I only helped you because it's my obligation. It's not because I agree with your plan."

"......?"
Um...
Judging by their conversation, Tohsaka wants me to project something

"Can I say something? So in short, you have something you want reproduced?"

"Yup. I need you to reproduce something for me.
 We can't match Saber or that shadow. So we have to create something in place of Servants, a Conceptual Weapon that exceeds the Servants."

"Conceptual Weapon? Is that the fixed magical item that executes a set phenomenon?"
"Yes. It's an Outbreaker that defeats its opponent using the weight of its concept rather than physical damage. I'm going to have you project a special Conceptual Weapon that has been passed down through the Tohsaka family."

"The goal is to make something that can match Saber's Noble Phantasm.
 You saw Saber's Noble Phantasm that defeated Berserker, right?
 In terms of raw power, Saber's weapon is the strongest.
 I'm sure even the shadow would be destroyed by a blow from her Noble Phantasm, and we can't dodge or block it if it's used against us.
 Conversely, we can manage a fight if we can make a sword that exceeds Saber's Noble Phantasm, even if it's an imitation that breaks easily."


...It's a sound argument, and a natural conclusion.
If Saber's Noble Phantasm is their strongest weapon, we just need to prepare something that outperforms it.
Make a weapon that is stronger than your enemy's.
It's the simplest and surest way to win.
But.

"...I don't know. I can't project such a strong Noble Phantasm. No, first of all, I've never succeeded at projection magic"

"Yes. I'm sure you've never been able to do the kind of projection that we magi are familiar with.
 But your projection isn't on that level. You were merely doing it wrong because you didn't know how.
 But you now have Archer's knowledge, so you just need to trace it. With Archer as your example, you will succeed."


Tohsaka sounds confident.
But even so, I have no confidence in myself.

"Look. I've told you before, but you're a magus that uses projection, not strengthening.
 You might not be able to make a replica with the same power as the original, but you should get close to it if you follow Archer's theory."

"Our role is to back you up.
 We'll prepare the materials to be as close to the original as possible.
 Ilya is analyzing the blueprint that you'll be using during projection, and I'm preparing the materials that were used to make the real weapon."

"...It'll be a little longer, but it's up to you after that. If you can reproduce my master's pass, even if it's just the shape, we have a chance of victory against Zouken."

"......"
Um.
So they're going to prepare the blueprint and the materials, and I'm supposed to put it together?
I have no problem if we can defeat Zouken that way.
I'll happily go with her plan, but

"Let's assume I really can project this weapon.
 If that's the case, we won't need any materials. If you show me the original, I can copy it.
 We can try it right now instead of waiting for you to get ready."

"Are you stupid? If it were that simple, I would've had you try it two days ago.
 Look, you'll be able to project once at most, and the projected weapon is certain to have flaws.
 But that's meaningless. We can't have you make an imitation like the failures in the shed that look the same on the outside, but contain nothing on the inside."
"...Hm. But I can only make such imitations."

"That's why we're backing you up.
 We're preparing materials that are as close to the real thing as possible to compensate for the required knowledge and magical energy, and have you fix it in place with your image.
 It's simple addition. We add your image and the materials we prepared to achieve a better result."

"...Well, I'm sure we don't need the material or the blueprint if you use Archer's arm to project it, but that's not possible.
 This is the only way to prepare a weapon without relying on that arm."

"So we're strengthening what's there using projection, huh?
 ...Yeah, that does sound..."
It sounds plausible, and we might be able to do it with practice.

"But I don't know if it'll succeed or not.
 I wasn't able to consistently use strengthening magic until I became a Master. I don't think I can do something like that on the spot."
"Oh, that's all right.
 I'm going to have you train your projection and practice retrieving Archer's knowledge."

"...I see. That's good for me too, but you look happy, Tohsaka."
"No way. I've been playing with building blocks with Ilya for a while, so I'm just thinking how refreshing it is to talk with a bad student."

"......"
...Ugh. I get the chills, recalling the weird sensation from yesterday.
Tohsaka got me naked, came close to me, and stuck her fingers in me.

Nothing happened then, but if we're going to do that again today...

"Ugh."
I might get a big scolding from Sakura, resting in her room.

"So, do you get it now, with all jokes aside?
 I want to confirm everything one last time."
"Confirm?"

"I'm asking if you're okay with this plan.
 We'll be relying on your projection.
 I won't let you use Archer's arm, but his influence will still poison you as you imitate his magic. Knowing that, are you still okay with this plan?"

"Hey, I have no complaints if we can defeat Zouken. And it's promising if you're the one training me in magic."

"...I'll be honest here. Using Archer's magic means releasing the seal on his arm.
 In short, I'm telling you to take off that Shroud while we're training projection."


My mind freezes.
Take the Shroud off?
Release this arm that terrified me, made me cry, and made me shake in the corner, just by loosening the cloth?

I don't even need to think about it.
I...
"Okay. If that's what it takes."

I muster all my resolve.

"I'll go with your plan. I need to take this cloth off, right?"

And I manage to nod.

"......I see. So it's as I expected."
"What is it, Tohsaka? Is my answer not good enough?"

"No. I just reaffirmed that threatening you is meaningless.
 I didn't think you'd be okay with taking the Shroud off, but your answer is satisfactory."
Tohsaka looks away, clearly displeased.

"Hey, you're acting strange, Tohsaka. It took a lot of effort to agree to that, and now it feels like I'm at fault here."

"Yes, I am the strange one.
 Your response was exactly what I wanted, but actually hearing it made me mad."

"But Shirou. I've already said this, but I won't let you use Archer's arm. That means never taking the Shroud off.
 I'm not one to talk after testing your determination like that, but don't ever say you'll take the Shroud off.
 ...If you do, there'll be no turning back."
I can't do that.
I recall the pain from last night.
The indescribable agony and the certainty of impending doom frighten me to the core.
But more than that...
I'm scared of what I'll do when I free this arm.

"...No. I can't take this off. Once I do, it can't be undone."
Forcing down the fear, I make my decision.
Then.

"Good. It's troubling if you take that cloth off so easily."
Tohsaka is pleased, even though I refused.

"......? Tohsaka, I said I can't do it."
"I know. I'm sorry, but that was just a test.
 I thought I'd warn you ahead of time since you have a dangerous side to you. I would've tied you down if you agreed."

"...Test? ...You tested me, Tohsaka?"
"Oh... Yeah, I wanted to know what you thought.
 Look, I've already said this, but I won't let you use Archer's arm. That means never taking the Shroud off."

"I'm not one to talk after testing your determination like that, but don't ever say you'll take the Shroud off. If you do, there'll be no turning back."
It sounds more like a plea than a warning.


I grasp my left arm that's covered by the red cloth.
I don't want to take this off either.
But

"...Then what about imitating Archer's magic?
 I won't be able to draw out his magic unless I take this off, right?"

"Right. So I'm going to have you loosen the Shroud a bit. That won't break the seal, and the reaction from the arm should be small, right?"
"........Yeah. Then what you meant earlier by taking off the cloth is..."

"Yes. I just meant loosening the cloth slightly.
 But that's still a big deal, so I tested your determination."

"You would have to do this eventually, anyway.
 You don't want to keep that on forever, right? You won't be able to manage it in the future unless you can at least put it back on. Like taking a bath or if it comes undone somehow."
"Ohyou're right."

"Right? So you should at least get used to what happens when you loosen it.
 The crest from yesterday seems to have familiarized itself with your body, and your magical resistance has increased. Ilya will protect your consciousness, so I think you'll be able to keep it unbound for about five minutes."

"Ilya...? So you want us to suppress Archer's arm together?"
I look at Ilya, who has been quiet all this time.

"No. I'm only going to protect your mind, so it's your role to endure the flowback from Archer.
 You have to retrieve his experience, so you need to bear with it, not block it off."

...Oh.
If Ilya cuts off the flow of magical energy from Archer, I won't be able to learn his techniques.
Even if it's poison for me, I have to taste it to understand its content.

"...All right. So I'm to loosen the cloth and bear the flowback from the arm, right?"

"Yes. Make sure to close your eyes and concentrate within yourself.
 It's just like opening the Magic Circuit, so it should be easy, right?
 Your body just needs to experience Archer's projection technique.  Don't worry about trying to understand it."

"I'm sorry, but I'm gonna leave for a bit.
 I'll leave the rest to you, Ilya. Please train Shirou while I'm gone."
Tohsaka suddenly gets up and leaves without hurry.

"......? What's up with her?"
"I don't know. I think she forgot something.
 But you have things to do yourself, Shirou.
 I'm against something stupid like loosening the Shroud, but I'll help since you promised her. Let's finish this before she gets back."

Ilya comes behind me and lays her cold hand on my back.

"Ilya...?"
"Just close your eyes and meditate.
 I'll protect your mind and loosen the Shroud once the Magic Circuit opens up.
 I'll time it, so you just have to bear the flowback of magical energy. Be sure to make desperate efforts, or the reaction will definitely swallow you."

Ilya talks without emotion.
I nod back and close my eyes.

...I quietly gather my senses and create another nerve inside me.
This step has gotten much easier over the past few days.
Once I complete the line of light running through my back...

"I'm going to give you a needless warning.
 Rin only knows the pain of having a heroic spirit's arm transplanted onto you. She doesn't know what this is going to cause. She has no idea what this is going to do to you.
 But it can't be helped.
 I'm the only one in the world who knows about the relationship between you and Archer."

Ilya is saying something strange in a voice too vague to hear clearly.
It's morning.
My mind slowly

                                                                                                                                                         .

"Hm......"
It's morning.
As my mind slowly awakens, I sit up.

It's past eight o'clock.
I'm late for school.
Well, that's not really true since I'm not going to school, but it makes no difference to the fact that I slept in.

"Whoa. I have to make breakfast."
I get up and get changed.
I can't avoid looking at the cloth wrapped around my left arm.

".........All right."
I swing my arm as a warm-up exercise.
It's fine.
It rises up to my shoulders, as I intended.
It's getting better day by day.
There's still no sensation, but at this rate...

"What're you doing, Shirou? Breakfast is already over."
"Huh? What? What?"

Ilya is in front of me.
I should be in the living room, but I'm in the shed for some reason.

"Are you listening to me, Shirou? I'm asking what you're doing here."
"YYeah, I'm listening. Good morning, Ilya. What a strange place to meet up."

......Hm.
That was an odd reply on my part.
It seems I'm not awake yet.

"Shirou? You're not feeling well?"
"Huh? Oh, no. It's just that I'm only half awake, so give me a minute."
I shake my head.
My body is dead tired, but my sleepiness goes away.

"All right. So, answering your question, I don't have any business here. I just made a stupid mistake because I was half-asleep."
"I see. Then let's go to the living room! I'll prepare your breakfast."
Ilya happily runs across the yard.

The sky is nice.
It's bright blue, as if trying to wash away yesterday's gloomy air.
I take a deep breath, and the cold, refreshing air fills my lungs.

"Hm? Did Ilya just say she'll make breakfast?"
That's the first thing I say after I'm fully awake.

Ilya's breakfast... I'm looking forward to it, but I'm also worried at the same time.
I'm pretty sure that Ilya has never even held a knife before, let alone cooked.

"Oh... I should go keep an eye on her."
I run across the prickling grass to the living room.
And I'm astonished once again.
I must've been really out of it.
What was I thinking, coming here in my bare feet?

Four minutes after Ilya...
I get up on the porch after wiping my feet.
"Oh, Senpai."
I run into Sakura as she comes out of the living room.

"Good morning, Sakura. ...I'm sorry about this morning. I overslept, and it was past eight when I noticed."

...?
Maybe she didn't hear me. She's just looking blankly at my face.

"Sakura?"
I reach out, afraid that she's sick again.
Then.
"G-Good morning, Senpai!"
Or maybe she isn't, because she greets me with lots of energy.

"Oh, you're full of energy. So I'm guessing you feel well?"
"Y-Yes, I'm doing great, thanks to you. You gave me energy!"

"...?"
Sakura sounds awkward.
...Being energetic is a good thing, but I get uneasy seeing her so restless.

"What's wrong, Sakura? You're acting weird. First of all, what do you mean by me giving you energy?"
"Umwell, um, last night..."
"In your room..."
Sakura trails off, blushing furiously.

"Oh."
I remember now.
No, there's no way I can forget about it.
Last night...
I had sex with Sakura.

And it was our second time.
We did it more furiously than the first time, and I lusted for Sakura's body.

"Uhum."
Blood rushes to my head in an instant.
I almost think that there's no blood left below my neck.

"S-Sakura... The thing last night..."
That wasn't a dream, right?
Sakura is still blushing, but she shakes her head and looks at me critically.

"...!!!!"
Amazing.
I thought my face couldn't get any hotter, but I guess I was wrong.
...Um, last night was amazing.

Sakura's service, our animalistic sex...
It was so stimulating that my mind labeled the event a dream and filed it away in the corner of my memoryno!

"Sakura. Um... I'm sorry I was rough yesterday."
Ignoring the blazing heat I feel, I apologize.
"Okay. But I was happy, Senpai."
Sakura smiles and gives a lethal reply.

"Uhum."
She got me.
Sakura's so cute that I want to push her down right here.

I would've lost it for real if the sound of the TV hadn't come from the living room, and...
"Shirou? Breakfast's ready."
...And if Ilya hadn't called for me at exactly the right time.

"S-So I'm going to go eat breakfast! I-I'll talk to you later about this!"
I pivot like a robot and head to the living room.
My limbs move awkwardly as I force down my desires.
"Here's your breakfast, Shirou!"
Ilya hands me a plate as soon as I enter the living room.
On the plate are blackened toast, a runny sunny-side up egg, and cut tomatoes.

"Oh, thanks."
My head's still dizzy, but I sit down at my usual spot and start biting on the toast.
I decline to comment on the toast, but the egg is done pretty well. Maybe she copied someone, or perhaps Tohsaka taught her.
Anyway, I have to give her a perfect score if this is her first time cooking.

"It's good."
I crunch on the toast.
 Ilya doesn't seem happy or proud, but simply watches me in satisfaction.

I'm not giving in to her happy mood, but I decide not to ask why the toast feels like coal.
It's good.
Having your toast black or hard is a matter of personal preference.

"It is a problem. You'll get sick if you eat something burned like that."
"You idiot. The burned spots are the best, whether it's rice or toast."
"...Hey. Are you all right, Emiya-kun?"
"I'm saying it's good. And I guess doing it rough is all right."
"You must really be half-asleep. This isn't time to be saying such carefree things, you know?"

Tohsaka looks at the TV.
The TV is on, showing the morning news.

Is this deja vu?
The news seems to be a story I've already seenand my mind sharpens up.

The captions on the screen.
An incidence of unexplained comas occurred in Shinto last night.
The residents lost consciousness overnight.
It's being treated just like the other mysterious comas, but it's different from before.
The area of the incident is 50 meters in diameter.
It used to only happen in one building at a time, but the damage is spread much further now.

...And that's not the only problem.
At the end of the report...
Beside the triple-digit number of victims is a new list called "missing people".

"Tohsaka, this is..."
"Yes. Fourteen missing people. I'm sure there'll be more once they look into it. Well, it looks like about a tenth of the people were completely swallowed."


My mind freezes.
I unconsciously...

"Do you get it now? I don't know if this is Zouken or the shadow's doing, but it makes no difference to the fact that there are more victims now.
 At this rate, a whole section of the town will be swallowed in a few days."

Squeeze my left arm.

"Tohsaka. Are the missing people dead?"
I ask to confirm.
Tohsaka looks away, which is answer enough.

"...That's all. I understand how you feel, but feeling guilty can come later.
 Look, they're starting to do as they please because they think we can't do anything about it. They can do ridiculous things because they're taking us lightly.
 So I don't even need to say what we need to do, right?"

Tohsaka quietly gets up.
...There's only one place she could be going.
Tohsaka does not urge me to join her, but goes ahead to the dojo.
"Well."
She leaves the two of them and comes out into the yard.
"What's going on, Sakura? Weren't you resting in your room since you're sick?"
Tohsaka Rin coldly regards the girl before her.

"........."
Matou Sakura looks down uneasily.


There are no words between them.
Rin mercilessly condemns the outsider, Sakura, who is at a loss for words, feeling beholden and inferior.

"Sakura. If you're here because you're worried about Emiya-kun, go back. I'll pretend I didn't see you."
"......!"
Sakura trembles a bit.
Her older sister is bitter.
She corners Sakura, even when she knows of her uneasiness.

"No, Nee-san. I just..."
Pushing her resolve, Sakura looks at her ideal, her older sister.
But...
"You don't need to explain. I'm telling you to go back to your room.
 I'm not going to let you in the dojo, no matter what you tell me."
Rin cuts off the girl's utmost resistance.

"Why can't I go in?"
"Do I really need to spell it out? You're our enemy when we're acting as Masters.
 Look, Sakura. Even if you and Rider are just staying in the house without fighting, it doesn't change the fact that you're under Zouken's control. There's no way we can train in front of such a person."


Faced with the cold words, Sakura can only stand there.
Tohsaka Rin is serious.
Unlike Shirou, her sister is worrying about when she might fall under Zouken's sway and become their enemy.
...No.
Rin probably assumes they will end up as enemies.

"......"
She bites her lip.
But she can't talk back.
As Rin says, Sakura can fall into Zouken's hands at any time.
Her body is getting worse every day, and her memory is becoming more vague.
Her only respite came when she slept, but now she's begun having nightmares.
...It'll be no surprise if she goes crazy at any time.

"That's right. Walking around when you have no magical energy only bothers us.
 You don't know when you might collapse. Well, I'm sure you won't collapse right now since you've settled down, but Emiya-kun will worry if you push yourself.
 ...He'd be even more cornered if that happens. That's not what you want, right?"

"......"
Rin is absolutely right.
Sakura drops her gaze further, biting her lip helplessly.

"Do you understand? Then get going. I'll go get you at noon, so rest until then."
She nods.
Rin turns her back to her younger sister.
As if to tell her...
...That she's just a nuisance.

"H-Hold on, Nee-san...!"
"What? You still have something to say?"
"Yes. I understand your point. I'll go back to my room.
 ...But please tell me. What are you going to have Senpai do?
 You know he can't fight anymore, right?
 But you're seeing him, and what more are you going to make him do...!?"


She stops before leaving.
Matou Sakura's appeal is born of desperation.
A fury of emotion that the quiet girl has never shown.
Though surprised, Rin answers her with the same coldness as before.

"I'm teaching him magic. We can't beat Saber, Zouken, or the black shadow as we are right now.
 So I'm going to have Shirou draw magic from Archer's arm.  That arm is filled with his experience, and that experience will flow continuously into Shirou if we loosen the Shroud, forcing Shirou to level up."

"Wha"
As a magus of the Matou, Sakura knows that this is a reckless plan.
What her sister intends to do is just torture.
It's like pouring a hundred units of fuel into a container called Emiya Shirou that can only hold ten.
Even if ten thousand units are poured, the excess will overflow, and the container will only hold ten.

But that will only be painful.
Emiya Shirou will gain from less than a tenth of the agony he goes through.
And most of alla person with a normal mind will never be able to endure it.
If you set a mud puppet against a tidal wave, the puppet will be washed away.
That's what loosening the Shroud means

"That's absurd! Senpai's body won't last if you do such a thing...!
 No, not only that! Senpai trusts you, Nee-san. That's why he's accepting your reckless plan.
 I'm sure he'll take that cloth off in the end if you tell him...!"

"Sakura."
Sakura does not look down.
She stares straight at her sister.

To that...
"...You're right. But, Sakura. He would take the Shroud off himself even if I don't tell him to. I realized it when I was talking to him earlier.
 ......Honestly. In the end, he'll take it off like it's nothing, no matter how strongly I warn him."
Tohsaka replies in a powerless voice.

"Eh... Nee-san?"
"Yes. I know that, so I had to suggest a plan that wouldn't make him take it off.
 If he knows we can manage without having him take the Shroud off, he won't do it unless it's a last resort. So my role is to make him create a weapon within set limitations.
 I'll have him rest after that. I'll even confine him, keeping him out of combat until the Holy Grail War is over."


She's telling the truth.
Tohsaka Rin is showing as much consideration as she can.
...But that is her mind as Tohsaka Rin.
As the successor of an old family lineage, Sakura knows the other side of Rin.

"Nee-san. I understand that you're concerned for Senpai's safety.
 But that's it. If you find out that you cannot beat Grandfather with the current method, you will end up using him.
 You're a magus of Tohsaka. You will use Senpai as a tool to win... to protect the law of magi."

They are not questions, but statements of fact.
The Tohsaka heir closes her eyes and...
"Yes. If our current method fails, and if Zouken and the shadow continue their rampageI'll have Shirou use Archer's arm. It's only natural if his life is the only thing at stake."
...She makes a declaration with her head held high.

"...That's selfish of you. Senpai never wanted the Holy Grail. He became a Master by chance. So it's wrong to force him to keep fighting."
"Hmph. It seems you misunderstand, Sakura."

"Look. I'm not forcing him, and even if that's true, Shirou has no right to object. His life was saved because I gave him my Archer's arm. But he hasn't tried to cut it off yet.
 That means his life is mine now.
 He's my Archer as long as he doesn't get rid of his arm."

"Do you get it? Shirou is my familiar until this war ends.
 There's no reason for you to butt in. As long as he wants to fight, I'm going to lend him my powers, and I'm going to borrow his power."
"......!"
She cannot say anything.
The girl cannot say anything back to her sister, who is full of intimidating confidence.

"Is that all? Then go back to your room. Didn't I tell you you're just being a distraction?"
Tohsaka Rin turns around and heads to the dojo.
The girl watches it as if it's a distant scene.

...The familiar yard is vast.
There is nothing around, and it feels like nothing is within reach.
In that artificial solitude...
"I see. So you're taking Senpai as well, Nee-san?"
...The girl murmurs something without emotion.
Whoa.
I don't know when Tohsaka got back, but she's in front of me.

"Huh? What are you doing, Tohsaka?"
"                         "
"                         "
  "                 state            right?"
"              rather             lunch         Rin and Sakura        Sakura more             "

"......."
...That's strange.
Why are they talking secretly in front of me?

"Tohsaka, Ilya."
......?
Maybe my throat is bad, as I can't talk in a big voice.
"Hmm... All right...

 Hey, what are you two talking about!?"

Their conference abruptly ends.
"Ah, ah, ah."
Oh, it's back now.
It seems the loud voice did the trick.

"What? You said my seasoning is new to you. So you don't like spicy food, Shirou?"

"Your food makes my tongue numb instead of just being spicy.
 We already decided to have Sakura cook lunch, so let it go already. Shirou said he wants Sakura's stew too."

It seems they're talking about lunch.
"Hey, now's not the time to"
I stop halfway into my sentence.
I see the clock and find out it's almost noon.


...Something's nagging at the back of my mind.
Nothing's strange. The dojo's the same as always, but I'm getting chills.
It...

Tohsaka left at nine o'clock.

      Information I don't know in my head.
Groceries

        I responded to their conversation
   something

in my head are details of every      weapon

   Ilya said something concerning

     the pain of the white arm

skipping 40, and 26 times

    the memory disappeared and returned.


I hit my forehead with my fingers.
It's fine.
The dizziness is gone now.

"Shirou? What's wrong? You're going to the shopping district with Ilya, right?"
I look through my memory.
I did indeed say we'll go shopping together.

"Yeah. Let's go, Ilya."
I shake my head and start walking.
"...Hey. You're acting strange. You were fine when we put the Shroud back on. Did the fatigue just catch up to you?"

"Hm? Oh...... Yeah, I'm a bit confused, but it's all right."

This is nothing compared to the pain from yesterday, and my body feels fine.
I was just a bit dizzy, so there's no problem at all.
"Oh."
A crashing sound comes from the kitchen.
This is the fourth time this afternoon.

"I-I'm sorry, I'm okay...!"
Sakura's voice comes from the kitchen.
...Tohsaka must be tired of scolding her, because she just sits there quietly.

It's before six.
Sakura is making dinner, as she requested.
Tohsaka and I were kicked out of the kitchen, so we're waiting for dinner without doing anything.

"Oh...!"
...The sound of a dropped plate.
In just half a day, I've grown used to hearing the sound of Sakura's mistakes.

...It all started earlier today.
Sakura couldn't make her stew after we returned from shopping.
When we came home, she was clearly not feeling well.

"I'm fine. I might have a fever, but I can still make lunch."

I'm sure Sakura could've made lunch.
But I can't push her when she has a fever.
At around two o'clock, Tohsaka and I managed to persuade her to take a nap.

And at the time, we promised her...
"Then I can cook if my fever goes down?"
...That.

And later in the afternoon...
Sakura was starting to cook in the kitchen after more training that ended before I knew it.

"Oh, welcome back, Senpai. Please hold on, dinner will be ready soon."
Sakura goes back to work, full of spirit.
But I can instantly tell she's just bluffing.

'You must be tired, so go ahead and rest.'
Sakura doesn't back down, even when I tell her Tohsaka and I will do the cooking instead.

"Geez. Please don't be so overprotective. I'm a Master too. This is nothing compared to fighting."

Maybe she's being obstinate, as Sakura does not back down.
On top of that, she wouldn't even accept any help from Tohsaka or me.

Tohsaka's surprise is so unexpected that I'm stunned.

"B-But Nee-san is training Senpai, so I can't be the only one doing nothing.
 I want to be of use, like Nee-san.
 ...And this is a role I've had for a long time. I want to keep doing it."

...This must be one thing Sakura can't give up.
It'll only make you uneasy if you can't do something that's been part of your routine for a long time.

'All right. I'll leave you in charge of dinner.'

Tohsaka started to criticize me.
But...
"Okay! I'll do my best, Senpai!"
It was nothing compared to Sakura's joy.

"All right, thanks for waiting!"
A cheerful voice echoes through the room.
Sakura starts putting the dishes onto the table.

"Oh, seasoned rice. That's a complicated meal you made, Sakura."
"Yes. You bought some good clams and shrimps, so I went with seafood tonight.
 The rice is cooked along with clams, the shrimps are steamed with minced meat, the squids are ethnic-styled, and I made some hamburger steak for Ilya-chan."

She's filled with confidence.
Everything looks delicious, like she put all her heart into it.
I'm pretty sure the secret ingredient is her high spirits.

"Wow."
*Clap* *Clap* *Clap*
The three of us at the table clap.

"I didn't know how it'd turn out, but it seems this'll be worth the wait. Thanks for the meal."
"I'm not going to hold back either. Can you pass me a fork, Shirou?"
"Here you go. Then I'm going to have some as well."
"Okay. There's more, so please eat up."

I bow and reach out for the steamed shrimp wrap.
It's bite-sized, looking more like steamed dumplings.
It looks pretty, with the topping of green onion, ginger, and radish sprout.
I was worried about letting Sakura cook for all four of us, but this is more than


...I freeze.
All three of us make a sour face for an instant.

We continue eating as if nothing happened.
...No, we can only continue eating.
None of the food on the table is good.
It's not that they're terrible.
But everything seems to lack something, and the taste is out of balance.


An awkward silence.
We don't make eye contact, but wordlessly continue eating.

...But it should be impossible to keep deceiving Sakura.
She's the one who made it.
She'll notice right away once she starts eating.
Our silence is only delaying the problem.


I look at Sakura.
...She must have realized it by now.
Sakura should be shocked, but...
She hasn't even taken a bite yet.

"...?"
I keep looking at her.
...What's going on?
Sakura is looking down at her bowl and chopsticks with a troubled face.

...After a moment's hesitation, she reaches out.
The chopsticks fall.
She quickly grabs them, and reaches out for the bowl.


I can't keep watching this.
...Sakura keeps repeating the same action.
She reaches out for the food with clumsy hands.
But she drops her chopsticks every time, and picks them up in a hurry.
...It doesn't seem like her fingers are merely numb.
It looks so clumsy that it seems like she's forgetting how to use the chopsticks every time she picks them up.

"U-Um... oh..."
...She doesn't see it.
Sakura should know how obvious it is to us, but she doesn't notice.
As if telling us she's all right, she keeps going through the same motions.

...She awkwardly picks up the food, quickly brings it to her mouth, puts it in with some difficulty, and then tries to remember how to use the chopsticks again.
She's trying so hard that there's no way I can ask if she's all right.

Tohsaka doesn't notice.
Or rather, she keeps eating as if she doesn't notice.


I do the same.
We pretend not to notice Sakura's abnormality and finish dinner silently.

I decide to clean up afterward.
Sakura wanted to, but I stopped her.
It doesn't seem like she can handle it, and I don't want her to find out that she can't do something she's so accustomed to.

"Just go back to your room, warm yourself up, and go to sleep. A little rest took care of your fever from before, right? Then"
Your fingers will work again if you sleep and rest.

I unnaturally stop myself.

"........."
"........."
Sakura bites her lip and looks down.

"Sakura. It's not like you'll be like that forever. It'll just take longer to get better if you push yourself when you're sick.
 None of this is your fault, so you should rely on us a bit."

"TThat's not true...! I'm not sick at all!
 My fever's gone, I can remember what happened yesterday, and I know who you are...! There's nothing for you to be worried about. So please don't worry"

"...You'll be fine, even if we don't worry about you? Don't be stupid. I'll be direct if you're going to push yourself."

"You took two hours to make dinner. You dropped a plate seven times, and you seasoned the food all wrong.
 You screwed up the salt and used too much pepper.  It didn't even seem like your cooking. Enthusiasm is fine, but it's counterproductive if you can't get results."


"Do you get it? You think you're well, but you're still sick. That's the only thing that'd make you mess up.
 ...I'm angry, okay? Starting tomorrow, you're barred from the kitchen. I'm not going to let you push yourself until your fever breaks."

Without waiting for her reply, I pull her to the guest room.
Her steps are heavy, but I ignore them and take her to her room.
Tohsaka is waiting at the door.
It's ten o'clock.
I know it's useless, but it's time to go patrol the town.

"...That was fast. How's Sakura?"
"I made her go to sleep. I'm sure she was tired. She fell asleep soon after she laid down."

"I see. Then we'll leave the rest to Ilya and Rider. We can't see Rider, but I'm sure she's guarding Sakura from somewhere in this house."

"........."
Rider is protecting Sakura, just like she says.
I'm sure she's remaining in spirit form to ease the burden on Sakura.

  'She probably will not last a few more days.'

...I recall the priest's words.
The crest worm in her body will take her magical energy as long as the Holy Grail War continues.
It's dangerous to put form to her Servant in her condition, and she should save her energy for emergencies.
That's why Rider is in spirit form.

"You look gloomy. Do you want to say something?"
"Huh?"
Something I want to say...?
How stupid. Of course I want to say something.

"Tohsaka. Can we beat Zouken tonight?"
We have no time to waste.
Sakura is weakening day by day.
If I'm to believe the priest's words, she might die tomorrow

"That's impossible. We can't match him right now.
 ...I understand your rush, but you have to be patient if you want to save Sakura. We can't help her if we die."
"We won't fight yet. ...Okay, I understand that. Then..."

"You want to say there's no point in patrolling? Shirou. Is beating Zouken all we want to do? No, right? You don't want any innocent people getting involved and dying, right?"


...That's right.
I know. I know.
The patrol has a meaning. Even if we just run away if we find them, we have to do everything we can so that there won't be victims like yesterday.
...But...
What did I swear to protect more than that oath?

"...Shirou...? Are you all right, Emiya-kun...?"
"Oh, I just felt a bit dizzy. I'm sorry, Tohsaka. I wasn't thinking."

"You don't have to apologize. Sakura's in danger, but you must be tired as well.
 I was actually going to have you acquire projection in three days, but you worked hard and succeeded it today. I understand that you want to fight now."

"What?"
I'm able to use projection after just today's training...?

"What? Did I say something weird?"
"No. Um, the training was so hard that it took everything I had to get through it, so it doesn't seem real."

"Yeah, you were absorbed in it. But you were able to project a dagger on your last try, thanks to that.
 Well, your success rate is below ten percent, so you need to keep practicing."


...Well, I guess that's how it was if I was that into it.
That's probably why it was late afternoon when I noticed.

When we get to town, I realize something's wrong.

Tohsaka must notice as well, because she shuts her mouth and concentrates on the surroundings.
The scene's the same as always.
It's past ten o'clock, and the town is dark and quiet.
There's no one out on the streets, and there is no sound.
...It's become familiar since the Holy Grail War started. A quiet, nighttime atmosphere.
But...

"It's quiet."
Tohsaka murmurs beside me.
...Yes.
It's quiet here.
The town has been quiet at night these past few days.
It's the deepest silence, the deepest sleep.

But still...
The silence tonight is quieter even than that.

"...Hey. Was it like that over there yesterday? It's not unusual for the houses to be dark, but even the streetlamps are off."

Tohsaka is looking down the road that leads to the Ryudou Temple.
The opposite direction from Shinto, right into the suburbs.
There's no light there, and it looks like a black wall.

"Let's go."
I step into the dark town.
Tohsaka is silent.
...This is something we don't even need to think about.
We both know what happened.
It's contradictory.
We know we'll have to admit the truth if we go, but we start walking, hoping that we'll be proven wrong.

"!"
What did I feel when I first saw it?
A black wall, completely obscuring the other side...
The instant I pass it, I understand what happened in this area.

The town is too quiet.
It's not that the town is asleep.
This is nothingness, devoid of any human presence.
It's total stillness, brought on by the death of everything in the area.

I get dizzy.
There's no change in the town.
The areaabout fifty households are standing in the darkness with no change.

There's no sign of broken doors.
There's no sign of broken windows.
And of course, there are no cranes to remove the roof and take everything out of these houses.
And at the same time...
The presence of the hundreds of people who should live in this area is gone.

"Emiya-kun. Let's go in that house."
She puts on gloves and goes into a nearby house.
She goes by the gate.
She opens the front door.
She walks through the hallway.
She goes up the stairs, looks through the second floor, confirms that it's empty, and goes back outside.

"The people in the blacked-out houses are..."
Tohsaka says they're gone.
The town is like always.
The buildings haven't even been scratched, and there are no corpses.
It's so clean that nobody would notice the abnormality even in the morning.
But still...
This area looks more barren than that time.

We look through a few more houses, but it yields the same results.
The buildings have no damage, but the people in them are gone.
All that's there are traces of magical energy.
Every building, road, and ground.
The black afterimage is stuck everywhere.
I know that thing caused this disaster.


I feel dizzy.
I feel like vomiting.
Corpses without corpses.
Blood without blood.
The desolate town, engulfed by the shadow.
I'm walking in such a place...

So why does an unrelated image pop up in my head?

...But it's not unrelated.
It can't be unrelated if it comes to mind.
'Stop.'

Remember. Remember.
You know this. You know this presence, this smell.

It happened back then too.
What did you imagine when you saw it for the first time?
'Don't realize it.'

It's the same.
No, something heavier engulfed this area.

'No.'

That time too.
Why did you...

...Imagine such a thing?

'That's...'

I have no positive proof.
I have no reason.
I have no motive.
I have no evidence.

'Who is this similar to?'

That can't be.
It's impossible.
I can't admit it.
But the more I think...

'If I become a bad person...'

I have no proof, so I'm made to believe that my intuition is right.
Yes. Because the sensation is...

'Stop. Don't think about stupid things.'

...Too similar to the heavy nightmare that comes after making love to 

"Shirou? Why did you stop? Is something wrong?"

I shake my head to dispel the dizziness.
...It seems the traces of the shadow are getting to me.

"No, I just feel nauseous. Don't worry about me and go on."
"Really? ...That's bad. So its lingering presence affects you, even with your increased magical resistance.
 ...Well, I guess that's to be expected with the amount of magical energy. You can't engulf a town unless that's the case."

"Ohit's not like I'm out of energy. I just felt sick, so it didn't take anything from me."
Tohsaka understands.
More importantly, we have to find out what happened here.

"......So. What happened there?"
"Well... It's eating, just like all the other incidents. It's just that the scale is much greater.
 Guessing from the traces, it didn't go to each house individually. It probably engulfed the area like a tidal wave and melted into the ground. It must've been hungry. It wanted to finish the food in one mouthful."

"But it seems it doesn't like inorganic stuff. It went past anything that wasn't alive, only digesting what was.
 ...If there's any comfort, it's that they disappeared right away. There was no time to feel any fear or pain."

A boundary field of dissolution.
Tohsaka explains that it's like the boundary field Rider set up at school, but much stronger and instantaneous.

"The problem is that I couldn't detect the magic, even though it's so powerful.
 ...If that shadow did this, it means this is not its magic, but just an ordinary action. In short, the dissolution in this area is like tossing around in its sleep for that shadow."

...I see.
But it's over.
The shadow is satisfied with the food and disappeared. There's no way or reason for us to follow it.


There's no reason to keep patrolling.
The damage has already been done, and we can't do anything without a way to sense the shadow.
We thought we could save people if we rushed to the scene when the shadow or Zouken was attacking them.
But it's meaningless now.

Because we have no way to find that shadow, and most of all...
"I suspected it, but that thing is growing every day. It'll be an unstoppable monster the next time it appears."
...We have no chance of victory right now.
A complete silence.
But they are not the only ones enjoying the spectacle.
No, that expression is incorrect.
The girl and the boy.
They are both still willing to fight, so they are not enjoying the spectacle.
Only inhuman minds are able to enjoy this spectacle.

"My, it is troubling if it does not know moderation.
 I let it alone for my good, but I may have to eliminate it soon."

The old man laughs.
The man and the white skull roam around the desolate town.
They are watching the girl and the boy.
The old man watches his enemies with pleasure.
There is no hostility in him.
How can he detest people who are not his enemies anymore?
For him, they are no different from rocks by the roadside.


But it's different for the white skull.
For him, an enemy is an enemy, no matter how weak they may be.
He will eliminate them if they stand opposed, and he will assassinate them if they are too strong to match.
That's his code, a rule he must obey.

"We can kill them here."
He tells his master.
The boy and the girl are full of openings.
In this land of death, they stand defenseless.
It only looks like sick people asking for death.
So he believes that he should be compassionate and kill them here.

But.
"No, that is too wasteful. We let them live until now, so it will be uninteresting to kill them here."
The old man has no compassion.
This thing that wears human form is rotten to the core.

"Hm. How about this scenario, Assassin?
 There is a sacrifice. A piece of meat that is ignored, cursed, and hated by the human world. This meat does not try to hate the world. It tries to not hate the world as long as it has at least one ally on its side."

"My, it seems love is precious and strong. The meat cannot hate the world no matter what happens to it. It's intently trying to suppress its mud, believing that hating equals denying its ally.
 So anything you do to the meat is ineffective. It accepts everything because it believes in the one and the only hope. It does not hate the world because it contains hope, and it does not let out the curse within it."

"Butwhat would happen if it were rejected by its only ally?
 From the start, it has been denied by the world. If it is betrayed by its only hope, there will be no morality to stop it."

"...Then you would like the boy to give the final push?"
"Exactly. He should be the one to draw the curtains. It was an unexpected growth, but he made it last so long. Then I should give him the pleasure of killing it."

The old man laughs.
Sadism and joy are contained in the laughter.
The chattering of the teeth is like a white skull shaking in the wind.
We return home before midnight.
It's because there's nothing we can do, and we can't afford to waste energy patrolling to no end.

My feet are heavy.
It seems the fatigue of the training is finally hitting my body.
My body is like lead, and my eyelids droop if I let my guard down.

...I'm sleepy.
My mind must be more tired than my body.
Every part of me craves sleep, and I want to pass out right here in the hallway.

"Welcome back. How was the town, Rin?"
Ilya is waiting in the living room.
...I don't see Sakura.
That's natural.
Because Sakura is...
"!"
No.
Sakura should be sleeping in her room.

"It was already over. How's Sakura?"
"Nothing happened. She's sleeping in her bed, and it doesn't seem like she woke up. I think she's doing well since she has spare magical energy from Rider not taking form."

"I see. But please be careful. It's over if she goes out of control again."
Tohsaka's tone is the same as ever.
Even after seeing those empty houses, she's acting normally.

"I'm going to sleep since I'm tired. What are you going to do, Ilya?"
"I'll rest as well. Tomorrow is iron making. We might fail if I don't get some good rest."
Ilya leaves with a "good night".

"Then I guess this is it for tonight. You should rest too, Shirou. I don't know if you can tell, but you're really pale."

...My body feels heavy.
 I can still lay out the futon in my current state, probably because it's a habit.


I fall onto the futon.
Looking up at the ceiling gives me enough composure to make me think.


I think with my weary mind.

I think about my left arm.
The loosened Shroud.
I was in so much fear and pain last night, but today was like nothing.
I have no memory of anything being painful or scary, and the day ended in a flash.
The answer's right there if I seriously think about it.

I think about Ilya.
She said she can't live with me.
She said she wants to, but can't.
She said she can't live long.
She said it as if it were common knowledge.

About that black shadow                                                            

I think about Sakura.
She is losing her freedom with each passing day.
It's because the crest worm is sucking the magical energy from her.
It's not Sakura's fault.
It's not her fault that her body's like that.
All I can do is to give my magical energy to her.
She should be able to maintain herself if I have sex with her and if I keep giving her magical energy.

I close my eyes.
Ilya said saving everyone is impossible.
I can choose only one.
I've already made my choice.

"...Senpai? Are you back...?"
I hear a voice from the hallway.

"I'm awake. Come in, Sakura."
I raise my body. I want to see Sakura even though my head's not working.

"Excuse me. I'm sorry, but I came since I heard sounds. ...Um, I never told you good night."

Sakura is like always.
She's reserved, considerate, doesn't say what she wants, is at a loss, and still smiles at me.
She became surprisingly beautiful in the past year, and she's so cute that I want to embrace her when we're alone. And she's someone I promised to keep protecting.

"Um, that's all. I feel well, thanks to you. I can sleep well tonight, so I wanted to tell you that there's nothing to worry about."

Sakura is like always.
But that's just a matter of course.
She can't be different.
There's no need to push myself and make love to Sakura tonight.
It's not as though Sakura's asking for it like that night.

"...Senpai? Um, am I disturbing you...?
 You look really tired and sleepy..."
"Sakura. Were you sleeping like I told you?"
"...?"
I just ask what's bothering me.
My tired head can't think at all.

"Yes, I was sound asleep.
 I saw another scary dream, but I was able to bear it since you were there until I fell asleep."

A scary dream.
I have to ask her what kind of dream it was, but...

I can't say anything, reaching out for her long hair instead.

"U-Um, Senpai...?"
"Come here, Sakura."
I lower my hand to her shoulder and pull her to me.

"U-Um, Senpai, I-I-I...!"
"I want to have sex with you tonight. You want to?"
I murmur, still embracing Sakura.

Sakura doesn't fight back, but buries her face in my chest.

"Yes. I'm very happy."
She relaxes and leans on me.

.
.
.
.

I have sex with her.
I can't hold it back.
I've done it with her twice, but her body is limitless and new, like I'm having sex with her for the first time.

There's no end to my lust.
There's no end to my urge.
From the start, my reason has been obliterated.
I don't want Sakura, but...

"......! Nha, ha!"
I just want to violate her.
I want to mercilessly thrust into her.
And I actually do.
Sakura's voice does not reach my brain.
I can only hear my violent breathing.

"I-It's goodSenpai, you're"
The sex was normal only at the start.
After that, I thrust my hips as if to break Sakura, and I kept ejaculating as if to make her explode.

If it's not enough, I just have to fill it up.
If it's not possible with one try, I just have to try more.
I'll keep it up until morning if that's what it takes.

"Fuaah, ah!"

I hear a beast's howl.
My brain only hears myself.
Then this wild, hungry voice must be mine.
It's Sakura that needs to be satisfied, but I want it more than her.

"Goodit's good, Senpai...! Please give it to me deeper, ahh, ah!"

There's no sense of time.
The morning is too far away.
I ejaculate again, and the power in my body disappears.
I tried to keep watching this dream until morning, but the power in my body goes off after two hours.

I fall asleep holding Sakura's hand.
"YesSenpai, I"
I feel Sakura's weight on my chest.
We feel each other's warmth as we fall asleep.

...The haze of lust clears from my mind.

What good did this do?
Maybe I merely confirmed my uneasiness by having sex with her
I'm seeing the scary dream again.

"Something" is walking.
Something scary that kills people whenever it walks.
...I'm watching it from behind.
I don't want to watch, but I can't look away.

This is a nightmare.
A nightmare I'm seeing over and over.

But to be honest, I feel a sense of intimacy with it.
It was scary at first, but I'm getting used to it after a while.
Most importantly, that thing does not have an evil mind.
That thing is something similar to me that merely eats in a different way.

"             "
"             "
"                       !"

...It's the same tonight.
Why do they all come?
Does it release some scent that attracts men?
No matter how many it kills, no matter how many days it continues to kill, the food comes to it.

It eats.
It smashed up the food when it first started, but it must be getting the hang of it recently.
There's no need to smash up the food.
It just needs to pull it in and swallow it.
It can eat the body and the soul like that.

Sing and go.
It's in a good mood tonight.
It has never shown any emotion, but it seems to be happy tonight.

I feel an affinity with it.
I'm very happy tonight too.
Because this is the first time.
Senpai asked for my body for the first time.
...Yes.
There's nothing to be afraid of now.
I keep seeing this nightmare, but it's all right.
The world looks so beautiful and kind now that Senpai's looking at me.

So I feel like continuing this bad dream, and going to look for another meal.
But...
"You are certainly working hard. Double the amount tonight?"
I meet someone that's scarier than the nightmare.

It runs.
The thing that never felt fear ran away from the person.
Golden hair and red eyes.
The person that has the same smell as me.
The golden Servant that...
"You should die now, girl. You will not be able to die if you become familiar with it."
...Warned me before to kill myself.

;  "       "
Run away.
                From what?
Run away.
                Who?
Run away.
                Why?

My dream doesn't end.
The thing panics and flees into the back alley.
But that's the end.
"I was hoping for a poorly-made Holy Grail, but I never expected to reach the actual thing. It is a waste, but..."

"I will do the selection myself. Curse yourself for being too compatible."
In an instant, the thing is showered with weapons.

...Huh?
That's strange. It hurts.
That thing is the one that was stabbed, so why am I in pain?
That thing is the one that's dead, so why am I on the ground?
I'm dreaming, so why

Why is my body cut up?

"Huh?"
It hurts.
It hurts even though this is a dream, Senpai.
Pink, squishy stuff is hanging obscenely from my stomach.

"Ithurts."
I try moving my hands to put my intestines back in, but my hands are only connected by flaps of skin.
Legsthere are legs, but I'm torn off from my waist down.

"No."
When I cry out, it hurts as if lightning hit my back.
But I can't jump up because I don't have my limbs.
Why am I...

"You're still alive? You're clinging to your life too miserably, girl."

He shows no mercy.
The golden man snaps his fingers, summons a blade that's bigger than my body, and comes to cut my neck.

"Ah"
A bad dream.
This is a bad dream.
This is like the bad dreams I've had.
This isn't happening, and I'll be in Senpai's house when I wake up.

...So I have to wake up soon.
Because it hurts.
It hurts so much that I could die, so if I don't wake up, I'll really

"AhAh, ah.........!!!!"
But I don't wake up.
I don't wake up from the dream.
Help.
Help, it hurts, help, help.
Quick, wake up, or I'll really

But I don't wake up.
I don't wake up from the dream.
The dream.
I can't escape from my dream, Senpai

And the woman falls.
The woman, pierced with numerous Noble Phantasms, crawls on the ground like a bug.

"Huh?"

She is still conscious.
Her life cannot be saved by any means, but she still frantically tries to move her limbs.

"You're still alive? You're clinging to your life too miserably, girl."
A scornful death sentence.
The golden mana heroic spirit called Gilgamesh mercilessly readies the final attack.

"...I don't want to die... Senpai finally accepted me... I want him to feel more of me"

She must not see anything now.
The woman babbles about her mundane wish.
Reaching out with an arm that's missing from the elbow down.
As if to cling to the small happiness she finally obtained.

"No... I don't want to die, I don't want to die...!
 BecauseBecause if I die now, Nee-san will..."

"That is unsightly. Do not trouble me."
The guillotine descends.
The dream ends.
Still covered in blood, the woman's consciousness disappears in the dirty back alley.

"Hm?"
By the time he turns around, it's too late.

"You have alrea-gah!!!???"
He is swallowed, beginning with his feet.
There's no way to run.
Because...

It takes longer than usual.

"...It hurts. It doesn't heal because it's not enough."

She starts to walk.
Her stomach is growling.
The only driving force in her brain is hunger.
Is she still not satisfied after consuming a heroic spirit with energy worth a few hundred thousand souls?

"...It's not enough. This isn't enough at all."

It's as if she's driven by a fever.
For the first time, she starts walking to the breeding area out of her own will.

"Haa."
My body's still heavy.
I have to make lunch for Sakura, but I want to rest a bit and clear my head.


I fall onto my futon, letting my face sink into the pillow.

...I know.
There wasn't any postponement since that day.
I can't postpone the problem anymore.
About Sakura.
I have to decide everything right now

"Emiya Shirou."

"Who is it!?"
I jump up.
A voice. I heard a voice.
I heard it from within this room.


A chill runs up my spine.
...The scary thing is that I still can't tell where in the room it's coming from.

"Do not be alarmed. I did not come to take your life."
A whisper by my ear.
The voice.
This fluent, yet alien, tone is of the Servant with the white skull.

"Assassin"
...How was it possible?
His specialty may be killing people, but he made it here without being noticed or setting off the boundary field around the house!?

"......You didn't come to kill me? Then you just want to talk?"

I search for the presence behind me while I measure the distance to the hallway.
It'll take two full steps, three full seconds to dash out to the hallway into the yard.
Assassin can kill me four times over in that time.
...Then my only way to live is to go along with him.

"Not I.  It is the magus who wishes to speak with you."
"...? Magus? You mean Zouken?"
"Yes. He is waiting for you at the Matou household. He has no desire to fight. He will welcome you if you go there alone."


...Assassin's words can be trusted to some degree.
If he wanted to kill me, he could've done it the instant he snuck into the room.

He didn't kill me because Zouken wants to talk to me.
That's not to say it isn't actually a trap, but
It's a trap.
It's obviously a trap.
But it's true that I might never have another chance to talk with Zouken one-on-one.

...And I don't really have a choice.
Even if it's a trap, I have to go see him and have him remove Sakura's crest worm.

"...All right. Zouken wants to talk to me, huh?"
"A wise decision. Let us make haste. Even I cannot deceive Rider's eyes for too long. The magus will change his mind if someone else realizes we're having this conversation."
"......Hah. So it's a secret meeting for my ears only, huh?"

...There's no reply.
His work must be done now that I've agreed.
Before I know it, Assassin has vanished.

I sneak out of my house to head to the Matou household.
The sky is filled with clouds.
Maybe it's because of the dark sky, but the house is filled with an ominous air.

I go inside without ringing the doorbell.
...It's been a year since I last came here.
I go through the hallway following my faint memory and head to the living room.

"Oh. You came earlier than I thought, Emiya's successor."

Zouken is the only one here.
I don't see Assassin or black Saber.
...It seems he really does want to talk with me.

"Hm? Oh, you don't even want to exchange greetings with me? My, you must hate me."
I feel no hostility from Zouken.
...In short, he's taking me lightly.
His composure is self-evident, confident in his ability to kill me at any time.

"Well. You must have something to talk about as well, since you've accepted my invitation. Sit down. It must not be something to discuss standing up."
"No way. Standing up is just fine for what we have to say."

...I suppress the urge to jump at him and punch him, and glare at him as if it could kill him.
Unlike Zouken, I can't hide my anger.
I won't let my guard down against the guy who changed Sakura's body.

"Zouken. If this is a discussion, I only have one thing to say.  Release Sakura right now."
That's the only business I have here.
I'll just fight if Zouken refuses.
I'll kill this monster before anything can happen, even if he calls for Assassin and Saber.

"Release Sakura, eh? ...Hm, I would like to, but I'm afraid I cannot do anything."
Then.
The old magus before me speaks in disappointed tones.

"What?"
"She cannot be saved no matter what I do, as it has grown too much. Sakura is already functioning as a Holy Grail. She will die even if I remove the crest worm right now."

Hold on.
Holy Grail? Sakura is functioning as a Holy Grail?
Why is he talking about the Holy Grail...?

"Wait. What do you mean by Sakura being the Holy Grail? What did you do to her...!?"

"I tampered with her to obtain the Holy Grail and make my wish come true.
 It is all for Makiri's dearest wish, to put shape to the soul, the true immortality. That is why I embedded the Holy Grail into Sakura after the war ten years ago."

"Whatyou embedded the Holy Grail...?"

"Right. You should have heard how the Holy Grail War ended ten years ago.
 Your father, Emiya Kiritsugu, destroyed the Holy Grail that was completed through the ritual we know as the Holy Grail War.
 The war ended, the summoning ritual a failure once again.
 Butit was not a total loss. The Holy Grail was completed, if only temporarily.
 Then it would be a waste to leave the broken fragments as they were."


My head quickly cools down.
In short, he took his granddaughter Sakura and...

"Yes. I embedded the Holy Grail within her. But I am no monster. I made sure she can function as a human. I knew it would be painful to have an inorganic substance in her, so I turned the shard of the Holy Grail into a living thing."

"Living thing... Then the crest worm in Sakura is..."
"It is something I created using the Holy Grail as catalyst.
 With that, her body became a container to receive the souls. It became a tool to become the gate when the ritual is completed.
 It is just a copy of the Holy Grail the Einzbern family makes.
 Well, I do not have as much skill as them, so I did about an eighth my own way."

He laughs.
...Copying Einzbern?
All he did was pick up a piece of a finished product and implant it within Sakura...!

"...You bastard! You can't make a Holy Grail, so you used a human being to make an imitation of the Holy Grail...!?"

"Experiment. It's just an experiment, heir to Emiya.
 This experiment is merely a stepping stone to the next. My plan was to slowly change her to something like a Holy Grail over several decades.
 It was supposed to be an experiment of Makiri's Holy Grail which lives as a human but still has the function to collect souls."

"Sakurais an experiment...?"

"Of course. Sakura was given to the Matou family for that reason.
 To give a daughter to the Matou family means giving us a foundation to achieve our goal. Tohsaka is well aware of that. We both have the same goals. We will both turn ourselves into monsters to achieve immortality."

"Immortality...?
 You and Tohsaka's father used Sakura for something ridiculous like that...!?"

"Of course. The Holy Grail War has always been a ritual dedicated to that end. That is the only reason we cooperated, and I am the only one who still lives.
 To use the Matou successor to achieve our goal in the far future."

"But fate can be quite ironic.
 Sakura was prepared to be an unadaptable Holy Grail, but she has shown surprising growth.
 My, I have gotten old. I never expected Sakura to have that much talent. Not only does she still live in spite of taking in so many Servants, but she still retains her sense of being Matou Sakura.
 She is a true Holy Grail, just like that of the Einzbern, which I thought was impossible to make myself."

"......!"
I can't hold it anymore.
I'm not patient enough to keep listening to the monster's nonsense.
Forgetting the possibility of Assassin's intervention...

"Enough of this bullshit...! You can't call something that only sacrifices human lives a Holy Grail!"
I let my anger take over and dash at Zouken with a raised fist.

But.
"It is a Holy Grail.
 First of all, even the Einzbern, who create the Holy Grail, used a human as their Holy Grail for this war."
"What?"
Zouken's smile stops me in my tracks.

"...Using a human?"
...My body wobbles back.
I hate myself for knowing who he's talking about, even though I don't want to understand.

"Right. Ilyasviel is also a Holy Grail.
 But do not consider us as the same. The Einzberns are far worse. You can ask her yourself what kind of a Holy Grail they prepared."


My upraised arm falls.
...Not only Sakura.
Even Ilya is the same, and regret takes over my body in place of anger.

"Well, I assume that was all you wanted.
 Then it is my turn now. The reason I called for you.
 I want to discuss the shadow with you."

"Wha"
Discuss the shadow...?
He must be talking about the black shadow that's attacking the people in this town.
But

"...What are you saying? That thing is on your side.
 So what do you need to talk about? Do you want us to beat it?"
I glower at Zouken, my voice thick with sarcasm.
"Kakaka, this simplifies matters!
 Yes, I want you to do something about that shadow. That is why I need your powers, Emiya Shirou."

"Whatare you serious...!? You guys are on the same side, right...!?"

"On the same side...? Well, I have helped it, but it has never helped me.
 I cannot even communicate with it.
 I merely arranged its path so it would not run wild. I calmed it down every night to minimize the damage it dealt, but as of last night, I can no longer continue.
 Did I not tell you? I cannot manage it anymore."


My heart thumps loudly.
'I cannot manage it anymore.'
Who is that directed to?

"Zouken."

"Ah, yes. I must tell you what that shadow is before anything else.
 In short, that is the content of the Holy Grail.
 People say the Holy Grail is an omnipotent pot, but the Holy Grail we aim for is not a pot. The Holy Grail is only a means.
 Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka.
 What the three families aim for is to open a gate using the complete Holy Grail.
 You can think of the complete Holy Grail as a gate to connect this world to a world where every wish comes true."

"...Hold on. Then the Holy Grail is..."
"Yes.  The goal of every magus is to reach the origin.
 But I am not interested in such a thing. The Einzberns only thought for the completion of the Holy Grail. Tohsaka is the only family of magi that is still aiming for the origin."

"...Anyway.
 The Holy Grail is a gate that connects to the wish machine. The shadow is something that has leaked from the other side.
 The real Holy GrailIlyasviel would not have done such a thing. That shadow is a mistake made by the imitated Holy Grail."

"Well, I do not like to talk about the shame of my family, but it seems I did not discipline her well enough.
 She matured as a Holy Grail, but it would appear she cannot shut the gate properly. I do not mind if she dies from her own carelessness, but I cannot have her involve other people.
 What a bother... the Holy Grail I made might kill everyone in this town."

Matou Zouken shakes his head, as if it's someone else's problem.


I should punch him for saying that.
But his words turn my emotions to ice.

"Then that black shadow is..."
Truly...
"You should already know. That thing is Sakura's shadow. You should recognize the similarities between them."
...Matou Sakura herself?


...I fight off the dizziness.
...The truth...
I accept the connection I've already known but denied.
No matter what that black shadow may be...
I have to accept that the crime is Sakura's as well

"Does Sakura"
"No, she should not know about it.
 That thing is the Holy Grail's shadow that appears through Sakura. It originally should not have form, but when it passed through the gate called Sakura, it took Sakura's form and obtained a body.
 The Holy Grail borrowed Sakura's sealed id to come into this world."

"It was beyond my expectations to be honest. I denied it since it was impossible, but I have to accept it now that it is getting stronger by the day.
 That thing is a Holy Grail with a will. That is why it keeps consuming human souls to complete itself.
 There is only one way to stop it. If the Holy Grail is born from Sakura's unconsciousness, you merely need to stop Sakura."

"I tried to persuade Sakura, but the shadow does not want me going near her.
 It does not have a will of its own, but that shadow is Sakura herself. It hates whoever she hates.
 I cannot even go near Sakura anymore."

"......What? Then you can't get close to Sakura?"
"No. You people think Sakura is under my control, but that is all in the past. She is already yours. I cannot control her, as I have been cut off from her."

"........."
It's something I can be happy about.
At the very least, Zouken can't do anything to Sakura.
Then if we can do something about the crest worm

"Wait. You haven't done anything to Sakura?"
"No, nothing at all."
"Then, Sakura's still in pain, because..."

"That's her own problem. I have never used the crest worm. She is breaking down because she is a Holy Grail and the powers of the Holy Grail are flowing into her.
 Think about it. There is a great swirl of magical energy that can grant any wish. Her human body must receive what flows from that source. There is no way Sakura's weak mind can endure the strong onflow."

"Whathen Sakura will..."
"Unable to bear the strain of being a Holy Grail, she will explode.
 No, if Sakura's consciousness empties, the Holy Grail should appear. She might be swallowed by her own shadow."

"Do you understand? It is meaningless to kill me here.
 The Holy Grail War ends once you defeat me. At that point, all that remains is for the Holy Grail to activate. Sakura's mind will be obliterated once that happens.
 If you want to save her, endure for the duration of the Holy Grail War. The timing to open the gate, the completion of the Great Holy Grail, does not last long.
 It has already been ten days since the war began. Judging from the past wars, this war should end in about four more days."

"Four days. Are you saying Sakura will survive if four days pass?"
"Who knows? That is for you to determine. How was she this morning? Do you think she will last four more days?"
"! She will. Of course she'll make it."

"I see, I see.
 But the same cannot be said for the other people. How many disappeared last night? How many will disappear tonight?
 Nohow many days do you think it will take for the whole town to be consumed?"

I can't really hear his question.
Does this man sound happy or sad?
My head is shaking so much that I can't tell.

Defeating Zouken won't solve the problem.
Sakura won't last until the Holy Grail War ends.
We can't beat that black shadow.
The people in town will continue to die as long as the Holy Grail War continues.
"...Then how..."
Can I save Sakura?

Then...
"It's simple. You just need to kill Sakura."
Zouken states the obvious.


"I am correct, am I not? She cannot survive even if you let her live, and the black shadow will attack people again tonight. Kill her right now to prevent that."
I feel dizzy.


"That is what I wish to discuss. I wanted to inform you of the current situation. I wanted to tell you that you are protecting the greatest disaster."
I feel like vomiting.


"Sakura will notice Tohsaka's daughter or me. But she will gladly give her life if it's for you."
I can't breathe.


"Ending one evil life to save thousands.
 You should know. If you are to carry out Emiya Kiritsugu's will, Matou Sakura is your enemy."
My mind isn't working at all.

I walk down the distorted hallway, unable to give a reply.
I don't feel anything even when I walk or lean against the wall.
It's ugly.
It feels like I'm in a twisted nightmare without an exit.

I go outside, still forgetting to breathe.

"You will not make the wrong choice. It is a pity for Sakura, but this is fate."

...I walk.

"But I will thank you in my granddaughter's place.
 She has never done anything for herself. She never cursed herself for being thrown away by her father. She did not wish to be almighty like her older sister. She was a mere puppet."

...I walk.
...I walk.

"The puppet was able to sleep with the man it loved. Surely, it must be satisfied.
 Do not condemn yourself too much. You gave my pitiful granddaughter a gift in the end."

...I walk.
...I walk.
...I walk.
I stumble towards my house, where Sakura is waiting.

I walk down the hill.
I'll reach the Emiya household once I go up the usual hill.

I can't leave my room empty forever.
No matter what the reason may be, I secretly met with Zouken.
It's not good to let Tohsaka or Sakura know about it.
So I have to go home before they notice.
Go home and...

I have to make a decision.

"!"
The contents of my stomach come up to my throat.
I chose to ally with Sakura.
I swore to protect her no matter what.
I chose to be with Sakura instead of becoming a superhero.
But that means...

Allowing another disaster to occur, taking hundreds of lives.


I can't do that.
I can't do that.
Emiya Shirou cannot break that oath.
It is like denying myself.

If you, the only one to survive that tragedy, are to allow the tragedy...
You will be rejected by everything that has supported you until now.

No matter the end.
Your crime will never be forgiven.


To not do anything means silently approving of the action.
There are innocent people who will be killed tonight.
If you know that, but still will not kill the cause...
You are no different than the cause of the fire that day.

'If you deny what you have been until now to protect one person...'

'Will you be on my side no matter what?'

This is a choice between protecting one person or protecting everyone besides that person.
Who will I side with in the end?
I have to decide by tonight.
It's obviously a trap.
I'm curious about what Zouken wants to discuss, but I can't be away from Sakura right now.

"I refuse. I can't trust you. Tell him to come to me if he wants to talk."
"I see. Then I shall tell him so."

...I don't hear Assassin's voice after that.
He must already be out of my house, heading back to Zouken.

"...This is fine. This should be all right."
Even if I can face off against Zouken, I have no way to kill him.
First of all, he's a monster one can't talk with.
I have to have all the weapons ready if I am to confront him.

"Gem sword, huh?"
The secret weapon Tohsaka and Ilya are trying to make.
Even Archer's arm, which remembers close to a thousand swords, has no information on such a weapon.

"...But we can win if we can reproduce it. I can believe in you, right, Tohsaka?"
I lie down on the tatami.
...I'm tired, so I'll sleep.
After I wake up, I'll go see Sakura, prepare dinner, and help Tohsaka

"......Hm."
Dinner's presence wakes me up.
Does dinner have a presence?  Of course it does. Like the sound of a knife on the cutting board, the sound of the TV, and the good smell of the food.

"Huh?"
In my room are Sakura's pajamas, an empty bowl, and a wet towel.


I search through my memory.
Looking at what's here, it seems I went and treated Sakura.
I try to remember, but I stop myself.
These are trivial things.
I must've forgotten about them somehow, so I don't even need to think about it.

Tohsaka is the one preparing dinner.
Sakura and Ilya aren't here.
They must be in the guest rooms.

"Oh, you're back? You just went out, saying you were tired and wanted to rest."

My face stiffens for a second.
"No, I'll help. You must be tired as well, so I can't let you do all the work."
I try to respond naturally so I won't sound suspicious.

"Are you stupid? I appreciate the offer, but you can't use the knife with that arm of yours. Just let me handle it tonight."
She starts cutting.
She must be stir-frying vegetables, as she's cutting lots of green peppers.

"...I see. Then I'll go prepare the bath. Oh, I guess I'll do the laundry while I'm at it. Can I go get your laundry?"
"W-Why are you saying such a stupid thing!? I'm going to do that myself, of course...!"
She slams the knife down on the cutting board.
She's dicing up some beef.  I guess we're having meat tonight.

"What's she making?"
I head to the bath.
I don't know what she's going to make, but I'm looking forward to

"...?"
The lights go off.
"Is it a blackout...?"

"...I guess so. The switches aren't responding."
"...Yeah. The boundary field hasn't been activated, so it's not an intruder."
"Yeah, even if Zouken attacks us, the boundary field will"

Not necessarily be activated.
Remember what happened this morning.
Assassin was able to pass through the boundary field without any difficulty!

"Stay here, Tohsaka. I'm going to go check, just in case."
"Hey, hold on. I'll go too. It's dangerous to go by yourself."

"Oh, yeah. ...No, then please go check on Sakura. I'll head there right after I go get Ilya."
"Okay. You can leave Sakura to me."

I hurry to Ilya's room.
It's dead quiet, but the house feels normal.
"Maybe I'm thinking too much. This is just an ordinary power outage."
Well, I guess I'll go wake up Ilya while I'm at it.
Even though the power failure interrupted the preparations, it's almost dinnertime.

"Are you awake, Ilya?"
I open the door.

Only scattered red comes into my view.

"Ilya."
Ilya isn't here.
All that's left are traces of blood.
In the corner of the room, admist the splattered blood, are minced flesh and a bundle of silver hair, but that's not Ilya.
Ilya is not human anymore.

I jump out of the room.
I cool down my head that's about to  and head to the guest room.
Sakura's in danger.
I grasp the situation in a second, but I haven't actually grasped the situation at all, and I jump out into the yard.

There...
...Stands something that should not exist.

"Ah"
It's like a ghost under a willow.
Why the boundary field did not go off.
Why such a thing is here.
Before I can answer these questions...
There was no time to run, and there was nowhere to run.
The house is already engulfed by the shadow.
If that is the shadow itself, there is no way to escape the dark night.

I've known it since last night.
I will be killed the instant I meet it.

The tentacle pierces my chest like a crowbar.
It mercilessly rips me open.
Blood gushes while my ribs bloom out like a flower.
Ilya must have suffered the same fate.

The flower petals flutter about.
Kocher. Here.
Scalpel. Here.
Unable to fight back, Emiya Shirou's body is prepared for cooking with no anesthetic
And it's the night I have to make my decision.

We won't be patrolling the town anymore.
Tohsaka spent the whole day making the gem sword and is now resting, completely exhausted.
The same goes for Ilya.
The three of us ate dinner silently and went back to our own rooms.

It's ten o'clock.
...The shadow should go into action soon.


I get up soundlessly.
I grab the knife I got from the kitchen and leave my room.

The door isn't locked.
I open the door without a sound and walk to the bed.


Sakura's sleeping.
That's all I can tell.
I can't tell if she's getting better or worse.

There's something wrong with my vision.
I can't even see Sakura's face even when she's sleeping right before me.

", "
I suppress my dizziness and trembling.
Prepare yourself.
That shadow might be attacking people while I hesitate.

If there's no way to directly kill it, I have to  Sakura here.
Even if it's not Sakura's fault, people are harmed.
There will be victims.
There will be people who could not prevent the harm.
...And Sakura will commit crimes she does not want to commit.


I raise the knife.
My mouth is dry.
It feels like my tongue's turned into a piece of cardboard.
The inorganic knife sends a chill up my spine.

My eyes become numb as I think about sticking this thin scrap of metal, whose only reason of existence is its sharpness, into a living human's throat, Sakura's soft flesh.
It's like stumbling and falling eye-first onto a flathead screwdriver.
The blinding pain of numbness peels the cerebral membrane like an orange peel.


There's something wrong with my senses.
The fingers holding the knife look as if they're all bending in the wrong way.
It looks like psychic powers in movies.
I ignore it and tighten my grip.

I...
I bring the knife down.
...Sakura doesn't move.
Her eyelids are shaking in fear, but she doesn't try to move away.


I drop the knife onto her white neck.
It slices it right open.
Is there a fire?
The red blood sharply splatters against the wall like a fire hose.

"Haah."
I drop to my knees.
...I hear wheezing sounds.
The splashing noise is coming not from Sakura's throat, but from my own.

...I see.
Even if Sakura has accepted her death, she won't allow it.
I tried to use the knife against the defenseless Sakura, and she attacked with her dagger, because I was even more defenseless.

"............"
I don't feel any pain.
Rather, I feel relieved.
...But regret remains like the bloodstain.
After I exit the stage...
Who will atone for Sakura's sin?

My heart hurts.
Blood drips down my fingers where they grasp the knife.

"!"
I grit my teeth.
I frantically swallow against the sob rising in my throat.

", !"
My eyes are hot.
I can't manage it looking down, so I tilt my face up and restrain my anger.

...Pushing the knife down.
I can't do something so simple.
I'm pissed.
There's something really wrong with me.
I had to come this far before I realized my own feelings.

"Am I stupid?"
...Right.
I had the answer already.
My path was set the moment I embraced Sakura under the rain.

      'Are you going to betray?'

Someone tells me to remember.
Wasn't I going to become a superhero?
My body is wracked by contradictory thoughts.

A superhero that will let many people die tonight for Sakura's sake.
A selfish superhero.

Kiritsugu threw away his own wishes to pursue what he believed in.
A powerless human that helps others just because of self-interest.

The fire ten years ago.
Because I was the only one who survived, I lived on, swearing never to let such a disaster occur again.

All the time until now.
The idea I believed in for ten years is piercing my heart.
Asking if I am betraying it.
Will I betray myself, who cried and tried to live on, ignoring the voices of the people who died helplessly?

The atonement.
Am I going to betray my previous self, who had to cling to that atonement to continue living?

"Yes"

No apologies will ever bring me forgiveness.
I can't make amends for this crime.
I'm throwing myself away.
Even if my life turns out to be a fake after losing what I've believed in until now...

"I will betray them."

I'll choose what I want to protect.
In the future.
If Sakura's smile is there, I won't even care if I have to live by deceiving myself.

...There's nothing wrong with it.
I need Sakura.
Sakura needs me.
For the first time...
I wish to protect one life instead of many.

"............"
I take a deep breath and loosen my fingers on the knife.
I won't lose my way anymore.
I'll pull the knife back and leave before Sakura wakes up.

And right when I'm about to...
"Senpai. Why won't you kill me?"
Sakura talks in the dark.

"Sakura."
She's awake.
Sakura is lying there trembling, watching the upraised knife.

...Her eyes are clouded painfully.
It's not sadness about having me kill her.
She's apologizing for making me resort to this.

"It's fine, please do as you wish. I'm too scared to do it myself, but I don't mind if you do it."

Is she serious?
I hear fear in Sakura's voice.
Her body is trembling, her eyes fixed on the knife above her as if watching inevitable death.
...It's...
...It's a determination that's doing all it can to keep her from running away.

"Sakura."

...How can it be?
I was so preoccupied that I didn't even notice it?
Sakura's trembling.
Why didn't I realize Sakura's determination!?

"Sakura, I..."
"I know. What you decided is probably right.
 Because I'm at fault here.
 ...I'll say it now, since this is the end. I don't know how long I can remain myself.
 I don't know how long the day is, what I talked to you about at noon, when that noon was, what happened yesterday, and what tomorrow is."

"That's not all. I see strange dreams. It's a scary dream. I'm always covered in blood, but a part of me finds it pleasant, and everything about it is scary."

"I'm the bad guy in that dream. I'm laughing as I'm stealing a lot of things from everybody.
 ...I was scared, asked for help, but nobody helped me."

"So I told myself it can't be helped that everyone's getting killed.
 They won't help others, so it's natural that others won't help them, and I ignored everything, thinking it's just a dream."

"...But I was wrong. I wanted that dream.
 I'm actually cowardly, filthy, cunning...
 I hated everyone, and all I could do was curse them. It's my fault for thinking that dream was pleasant, even for a second.
 It's not the dream that's bad. It's me, the one who watches it, that should never have existed."

"Senpai. I'm slowly breaking down.
 At this rate, I'll see nothing but those dreams and forget about you. I'll be a villain for real, going around and killing people."

"Soplease.
 ...If you can finish it here before I become the bad guy, then"
Sakura tries to say she'll be saved.

But.
"Oh"
I silence her with an embrace.


I hold her to me tightly.
...The embrace I could not accomplish before.
I pull her to me with the arms that only touched her back then.
I hold Sakura's body with all my strength.

"......Senpai."
...Sakura doesn't resist.
She's scared of dying, yet she asked to be killed. But, at last, she relaxes and...
"......No, you'll regret it..."
She says the same exact words as that night, as if thanking me.

"...It's too late.
 It's not about the future. I regret not being able to protect you all this time."
...A quiet sobbing.
Sakura puts her arm on my shoulder.
Her cold fingers run across my cheek.

"I'll protect you. I'll protect you, Sakura."
I promise Sakura as she cries.
...That's all I can do.
That's the only thing I can repeat to forgive each other.

I swore to be Sakura's superhero on that night.
I have no regrets.
I won't complain about this choice.
If anyone deserves an apology, it's only one person.

Will you forgive me, Sakura?
I don't say it out loud.
For betraying myself?
And I confess my crime.
It all happened ten years ago.
I kept pursuing the responsibility for being the only survivor in the fire.

  'Are you going to      ?'

I never forgot about it.
I survived, so I...

  'Are you going to betray?'

...I swore never to let such a thing happen again.
I made an oath with myself to become a superhero like Kiritsugu.
Emiya Shirou's days were turned to that sole purpose.
I let others use me so that I could hold my head up high before those who were not saved, and I made it this far because of that.

I know.
I know fully well.
But you...

  'Are you going to betray your previous self?'

You know the cause.
You already know who you must defeat.
The black sun.
If the shadow in the sky is the cause, you must kill it before it happens again.

"Ah"
Remember. What have you lived for until now?
You have approved of yourself because you save innocent people, because you save people who ask for help.
But if you are going to deny it just for one girl...

'If you are going to betray it...'

Emiya Shirou will be judged by himself

"It's morning."
I wake up.
It's bright outside, and it's past seven already.


My body feels heavy.
My limbs feel numb.
My dull head can't remember who I am.

"Oh. What do you want for breakfast, Sakura?"
I pat Sakura, sleeping beside me.
For a strange reason, I remember why she's there next to me.
The fact that the girl I love is sleeping next to me is probably more important than my identity.

"It's morning, Sakura. We have to get up, or breakfast and Tohsaka"
I tap her shoulder.
...Sakura's cold.
Not her attitude, but her sensation is cold, and she's also hard.

"......Sakura?"
I raise my body and look around the room.


She's not here.
We slept together and I held on to her hand, but Sakura is nowhere in the room.

"Sakura!"
She is nowhere to be seen.
The guest room is silent.

I feel no presence in the living room.
"Haa, !"
My body doesn't move well. I hit my foot on the table.
I fall, pull myself up using the wall, and head to the hallway.

". , "
I must be in a hurry.
There's nothing wrong with my body, but my mind isn't calm at all.
Why am I rushing, and why am I feeling so uneasy?
I'm trying to think, but whenever I do, it's like my thoughts are ten seconds in the future.

I can't think?
Or does my brain not recognize what I'm thinking?
Blood won't flow to my head, so I can't even tell.

", , "
I can't remember what I want to do.
But I'm relieved when I see Sakura's shoes at the front door.
Tohsaka's shoes aren't there, but Ilya's shoes are.
...Which means...

"......Um, her shoes are not there, so..."

                                                                                                                                                                                          .

"Yeah. Tohsaka's the only one outside, so it means Sakura's in the house."
Oh, so that's why I feel relieved.
Sakura hasn't gone anywhere.
All right, I'm getting sharper.
So yeah, Sakura just woke up before me, so she's probably doing something like washing her face, preparing breakfast, training in the dojo, or doing the laundry in the yard.

"Man, I got worked up over nothing."
I sigh and head back to the living room.
"Eh, Shirou!?"
Tohsaka comes running inside.

"What, Tohsaka? Are you taking a walk?"
"I'm not that easygoingno, we can talk later!
 Sakura's collapsed outside, so carry her in! I'll prepare the treatment!"
The clock ticks.
It's past nine o'clock.
It's been two hours since I carried Sakura in from where she'd collapsed by the entrance.
Function is finally returning to my numbed mind.

"Have you calmed down, Shirou?"
"Yeah, I'm fine now. I'm sorry for worrying you, Ilya. I don't remember what happened the last two hours, so I don't remember what kind of stupid things I may have done."

"Hmm, you didn't do anything. You carried Sakura inside, then held her hand while Rin treated her. She didn't have any external wounds, and you just sat down once you found out it was only a high fever."

"I see. Where's Tohsaka? I think she took Sakura to her room."
"Rin was checking out the closet earlier.
 Oh, she must've been looking for Sakura's clothes. She was dirty and sweaty, so you have to change her clothes before you can put her to bed."


I see.
It makes sense, now that she says it.
...Then I must still be in the living room because...

"Hey. Why are you following us when I'm about to change her clothes?"
Tohsaka probably said something like that to me.

"...Hm."
Sakura and I are in a relationship, so I should be able to change her clothes.
I can, but I think it's different to get naked out of your will and having someone take your clothes off when you're unconscious.
I'd be embarrassed if somebody changed my clothes while I was sleeping, so Tohsaka's completely right.

"So I've been waiting for two hours, huh? I might've been in a panic, but..."
I feel very stupid.
What's going on?
There are many things I have to think about.
Sakura's well-being.
The big meal the enemy had last night.

...No, that can come later.
I should be thinking about why Sakura was collapsed outside when we went to sleep together


I feel sick.
My mind refuses to think.
The blank two hours.
My body remembers that I've been pondering that problem for all that time.

"Shirou. Don't try to remember something you can't.
 You didn't forget it, but it went away. There's only pain even if you try to find what's not there."
"EhIlya?"
"...It's nothing. I was just talking to myself, so forget it."
Ilya looks away and shuts her mouth.

A few minutes after that.
When the clock is about to strike ten...
"Thanks for waiting. Sakura's awake now."
Tohsaka enters, acting like nothing's happened.

"...Tohsaka. Is Sakura all right?"
"I don't know. You should go ask her yourself. There's nothing for me to say."
"...All right. I'm going."
I get up.
I leave Ilya and Tohsaka in the living room and head to Sakura's room.

"Good. You're here, Senpai."
Sakura is breathing hard.
But she speaks the instant she sees me.

"Of course I'll come, you idiot. I'll go anywhere for you if you collapse. Tohsaka got the job this time, but it's me that should be treating you."

I get the chair and sit down.
I try to sit level with Sakura, who's lying on the bed.

"So, how are you doing? Tohsaka didn't tell me anything."
"Oh, I see. So Nee-san is keeping quiet."

"No. She said I should ask you. She's being considerate, huh?"
"Oh, you seem happy, Senpai. I thought so for a while, but you like the strict part of Nee-san, right?"

"Y-Y-Y-Y-You idiot, that's not true!
 Tohsaka's a steady girl, but I don't want to deal with that all the time. First of all, we can't manage unless she's considerate at times like these."

Sakura nods, smiling.
Her satisfied expression dispels my uneasiness somewhat.

"...Good. I guess you're all right. What was Tohsaka saying, Sakura?"
"Um, I'm just exhausted and malnourished, with a light fever.
 There's nothing to worry about if I'm resting, so she told me I have to stay in bed all day."


She's still breathing hard.
...Just lying there must be painful.
She's probably trying to breathe normally so she doesn't worry me.

"I see. Then keep resting. Um, you have enough magical energy, right?"
"Oh... y-yes! U-Um, you were amazing last night, so I have enough."


Even though I'm the one that asked, I still blush.
...But this is something I have to know.

"Then you'll get well right away if you eat something good and nutritious. I'll put in my best efforts for today's lunch."
I roll up my sleeve in a show of confidence.
But...

"...I'm sorry. I should be cooking for you.
 ...If I could just stand up, I could help you. I hate that I can't even do that."
...It seems my words hurt her.


...That's right.
Sakura is concerned about her role.
She knows she can't do anything, so she just tries to be the normal Matou Sakura.
But she can't even manage something as simple as that.

"Well, just bear it for now. A sick person has to rest like one. After all, I'm going to leave you in charge of breakfast, lunch, and dinner once you get well. You'll regret not resting more then."

I jokingly say what I plan to do.
...Yeah.
I can leave her in charge of cooking for about half a year if that'll please her.

"Really? You can't take it back later, okay?"
"I'm serious. I won't do anything for at least half a year.
 Well, I'd like to at least keep watch on the food on the gas burner when you need help."
I've been standing in the kitchen for eight years.
I don't feel at ease unless I'm holding a pan or something.

"Okay, then it's a promise. Please eat my meals once I get well."
"Yeah. I'll promise you all you want."

I get up.
I can't keep talking to her and tire her.
We were able to talk, and I know Sakura's doing fine.
I should let her rest now.

"Then I'll see you later. I'll come here again during lunch, so sleep until then."
I step away from the bed.
Sakura nods silently.

"Oh yeah, Sakura."
I stop at the door and call out to her without turning around.

"Yes? What is it, Senpai?"
"Oh, I was wondering why you were collapsed in front of the house.
 You were sleeping in my room, right?"
I try to ask as naturally as I can.
After a faint gasp...

"I was taking a morning walk. I woke up early, so I went outside, but then I collapsed.
 Nee-san's right. I shouldn't be going outside right now."
...She replies as naturally as I asked her.
Tohsaka and Ilya aren't there when I return.
"...They must've gone to their rooms."

Oh, yeah.
They're busy trying to reproduce the gem sword.
I can only help after they make a replica similar to the original.
My job for now is to draw out as much of Archer's experience as I can.

"I am the bone of my sword, huh?"
...Archer's original spell, which flowed into me along with the pain.
If I use this strangely familiar incantation to look within myself, my rate of success greatly increases.
Projection now succeeds half the time.
I'm copying Archer to make a copy of something.

"But I can only create a fake."
...Projection is reproducing something identical to the original.
Emiya Shirou can only create an inferior imagination.
The only way to create a phantasm is with the arm's help.

"!"
Suicide.
It's not that poison will come into me once I use it.
A bomb will be switched on once I use it.
A sure end will come once I use it.

An image of a firing hammer.
There's a gun in my brain.
The muzzle is pointed outward, but the trigger is still there.
This image must be the time bomb Kotomine spoke of.

"But if I can take the gun out of my head, the switch won't go off even if I use it."
No, the switch itself will be outside my body.


That's the best solution.
But of course, I have no idea how to do that.

"Oh yeah, the news."
I turn the TV on.
I have to know what happened yesterday, so I watch the news.

It's easy to find the right channel.
They're all talking about that incident.

The unexplained disappearances.
There are over forty houses with missing residents.
None of the survivors noticed their neighbors' disappearance.
And almost sixty people will never return.


I memorize each missing person's name as it appears.

One by one.
I engrave the strangers' names in my mind.

And I replace the names with people I know.

"!"
Will you be able to forgive it?
Will you still be able to forgive it when the time comes?
Will you be able to forgive the thing that's causing it?
Will you be able to forgive yourself for overlooking it?

"........."
The crime.
If I cannot protect it from the crime...
It will be painless salvation to stop it before it commits any more crime

The TV switches off.
The news that has been informing me of the incident is...

"Don't be stupid.
 We're not decent enough people to mourn over what's already done."
...Mercilessly cut off by Tohsaka.

"Tohsaka."
"Here, I brewed some tea, so drink up. I have nothing to do because Ilya wants to be alone."

Tohsaka places the teacup on the table.
Her reasoning doesn't sound right.
So I don't have to do what she tells me to, but...

"I'll drink the tea."
"Yeah. But it's so hot that it'll burn your tongue."
"I see. That's even better. Thanks, Tohsaka."

"...Heh. I just wanted to get myself together. You just happened to be here, okay?"
If this is how she wants to show her concern for me, I'll just have to accept it.

Time passes.
We just drink the tea silently.


I don't feel nervous for some reason.
I rather feel relaxed.
...This is purely speculation, but...
Could Tohsaka be one of those girls that soothes the atmosphere?

"Hah."
"W-Why are you smiling all of a sudden? Tell me if you want to say something."

"Oh, I was thinking to myself. We've never sat around doing nothing like this, right?
 Whenever we're together, we talk about the Holy Grail War. So I thought we had a pretty savage relationship."

"I-I can't help it. That's how it all started! Or what? Do you want me to talk about what might come up on the finals or what stores I like to go to?"
"Huh? I guess it's fine as is. I think this dangerous relationship is suited for us."
But we were so relaxed that it felt weird and funny.

"Well, you're right. That's how it all started.
 We started talking with each other after we became Masters, and I wouldn't have gotten to know you unless I became a Master."

Well, that's one good result I got from becoming a Master.
I can fight alongside the girl I've admired.

"That's not entirely true. I don't know about you, but I've known you for quite a while."
"Huh?"
Tohsaka blushes, saying something I can't ignore.

"Y-You knew me?"
Tohsaka nods with embarrassment.

"N-No way...! Did we talk when we were in the first year!?"
"N-No.
 I knew about you, but you didn't know about me.
 You're one of my traumas."

"W-Why!?"
I don't like that.
I know it can't be helped to hurt someone when you don't know about it.
But it's not good for my mental health to know that I've hurt Tohsaka, who likes to strike back three or four times as hard!

"I'm the one who wants to ask that.
 ...Fine, this is a good opportunity, so let me grumble a bit.
 It happened around this time four years ago. I don't know why, but you were there after school, doing running high jumps until the sun set, right?"

"Huh?"
I'm taken aback by the unexpected question.
It's not the question itself.
What surprised me is that Sakura was talking about the exact same thing.

"Yeah. So what?"
"I was watching that. I was right by the school entrance. I was an idiot watching another idiot who kept trying to jump a height he couldn't clear."


Hold on.
That can't be.
Sakura was the one watching me, and first of all...

"I-It was just a coincidence, okay? I went to your school because of a matter related to the Student Council. I was in a different school, let alone class."
"Yeah. I heard that you went to the same school as Issei."

"Yeah, we've known each other since then. I was the vice-president and he was the president. After four years spent fighting, we found out that we can't get along."

"...I see. So it was a long relationship."
I finally understand now.
I knew Issei's attitude towards Tohsaka was not normal.
Well, the mystery is unraveled... actually, it seems even more tangled now.

"Anyway, I just happened to see you keep trying to jump over a height you couldn't.
 That's all. That's when I first saw you, and I found out later that Sakura came to this house. I didn't know your name until then, and I forgot about your face."

...Well, now I know how she knew me.
"Um, is that something traumatic?"

"Humph. It's revenge after four years.
 Sakura joined the archery club a year ago, right? So I went and watched when I got the chance. And I happened to see someone who wasn't a club member shooting arrows.
 I knew right away that you were the idiot from that time."

I want to say something about what she thought about me, but I stay quiet.

"...And I was shocked at that time. There was this stranger who went to a different school that I'd considered stupid all this time, but I remembered him even after three years.
 And I finally realized that you've been giving me damage all this time.
 I found out I was jealous of this guy that kept on running like an idiot."

"Why? He was stupid, right? That's not someone you should be jealous of."

"Yeah. I probably wasn't jealous of him, but I felt Iike I'd lost. ...It would've been fine if he'd had hope of clearing that bar. I would've just gone home if that were the case."

"...But even he knew it was impossible.
 He knew nothing would change that, but he kept trying. It's as if he believed the effort was what mattered."

"...To be honest, I can't do such a thing.
 I've always been like that. I determine whether or not something is possible. If I know it's impossible for me, I quickly give up. I don't try what I can't do, and I never regret it or think I'm powerless because of it.
 I'm cold like that. I'm a terrible person. Kirei called it machine-like instead of cruel."

But Tohsaka isn't belittling herself.
She's proud of how she is.

"But I do sometimes think how pure it'd be to just keep trying without a thought for whether it's possible."

"...Well, as a child, it's shocking to see someone that's completely the opposite of you, right?
 That's why it was traumatic. That guy who foolishly kept running was..."

Someone I was happy to know existed.
Tohsaka murmurs with a dreamy expression.

"Oh, that was boring talk. Maybe I'm being nervous because things aren't going well."
Tohsaka gets up, as if saying the break's over.

"I'm going back to my room. I'll be creating the framework with Ilya in the afternoon, so you go watch Sakura."
She puts her cup in the sink and heads to the hallway.

...But.
"Hey. How was Sakura?"
She stops and asks, as if she's just remembered.

"She seemed well. She still has a fever, but it's better than the last time she collapsed.
 Sakura is calm as well. She pushed herself to do things around the house, but she's being obedient and resting today.
 That being the case, I'm sure she'll be better in no time."

"Of course she's staying still.
 She can't get up by herself now."

"What?"
She can't get up by herself now...?
"Why? She should have enough magical energy. Then shouldn't she have enough physical energy as well?"

"Yes, she has more than enough magical and physical energy. But it's terrible inside.
 ...I don't know what happened last night, but she definitely died once. That's the only sound explanation for why the muscles in her limbs are so badly damaged."

"...No way. She didn't have any external wounds."
"...It's just that it's cleanly connected on the outside.
 I don't know if the crest worm ripped her apart, or if someone else tore her limbs. ...If something really did tear her body apart, the pain would have destroyed her sanity.
 ...Let me ask. Did she recognize you?"


I swallow my affirmation.
...Tohsaka's expression is agonized.
Then that means...

"...Sakura didn't recognize you?"
"She did. She knew me, and she called me Nee-san.
 But she wasn't looking at me, but was looking at the Tohsaka Rin she imagined.
 ...Yeah, I really wanted to kill her when she said things like 'nice to meet you' and 'I wanted to meet you sooner.'"
Tohsaka looks away as her words turn cold.

...Wanted to kill?
...Tohsaka felt murderous intent against Sakura?

"In short, I can't do it.
 I can't protect Sakura until the very end like you, and I don't intend to either."
"Tohsaka."

"I told you, right? I don't do impossible things.
 As long as I'm Tohsaka Rin, I'll kill Sakura the moment I determine that it's not possible to let her go on. Well, I don't need to say it again because that was our deal all along, but I thought I'd remind you."

"You don't need to say anything. I know how you feel, and even if you say something, it won't accomplish anything.
 We're allies while we fight against Zouken, but we're enemies when it comes to Sakura. If you don't like it, we have to defeat Zouken as quickly as possible.
 ......But Shirou. What will you do if Zouken and the shadow are two separate enemies?"


I shut my mouth.
Tohsaka's question is so sharp that it makes me dizzy.

"Shirou. I'll kill her when the time comes. That's the best choice for both of us.
 You think about it too."
Tohsaka leaves.
She goes back to her room, leaving me alone in the living room.
...She hears voices.
Her body is broken and her head feels light, but she hears voices she doesn't want to hear.

"I don't know about you, but I've known you for quite a while."

She doesn't think about why she can hear the conversation.
But she doesn't want to hear them.
She wants to cover her ears if her arms would move, and she wants to go stop them if her legs would move.

"I was watching that. I was right by the school entrance. I was an idiot watching another idiot who kept trying to jump a height he couldn't clear."

"!"
She bites her lip.
She scratches the sheets with her fingers.
A past event, spoken of lightly.
The event that happened four years ago.
Her older sister speaks of it as if it's only her memory.
Like she's the only one who knows about it.
She's immersed in her beautiful memory, never even realizing that another girl was there.

"Stop. Stop. Please don't..."
"Don't take away my memory."
She strains her voice and makes a plea that none can hear.

The older sister's monologue continues.
It goes on without her, just as she feared.
The only thing.
The only thing she had an edge on over her older sister is brought down to mere recollections.

"NoNo, no, no...!"
Using magical energy to bridge the gaps in her ripped nerves, she covers her ears with her hands.
This is torture.
How can she know what's going on in the living room?
Has her shadow stretched that far?
No, she doesn't want to hear anything right now.
No more.
She will go crazy if she hears any more.

Knowing this instinctively, she covers her ears, but the voices do not get any quieter.
Her sister's voice resounds directly into her brain.
She cannot get away, even if she covers her ears or eyes.
And...

"Shirou. I'll kill her when the time comes. That's the best choice for both of us.
 You think about it too."

Her sister coldly says the words she does not want to hear
to the last person she wants to hear them.

And the voices stop.
She cannot tell what's going on in the living room anymore.
...It's only natural.
Her only world is this dark room.
There's no way for her to step into the world of light.


...Her eyes are hot.
She realizes that she's crying.
Heartbroken and frustrated.

Her older sister is a coward.
Why is she pushing that onto the girl's Senpai now?
It's her responsibility as Tohsaka's magus, but she's now trying to involve someone else.
Her sister is trying to turn her only ally against her.

"Nee-san..."
...She hates her.
She knows it's selfish, but she still hates her.
She's making him abandon Matou Sakura.
She hates Tohsaka Rin for trying to induce him.

"Nee-san."
...But it's strange.
This is what she wants, so why does she hate her so much?
Her sister is saying she should disappear.
The girl also knows she should disappear.
...She doesn't know how it's come to this, but she does know that Emiya Shirou will be saved if she disappears.

"......No, I don't want that."
She can't.
She doesn't want to lose anything.
She doesn't want to be alone anymore.
She learned of warmth, so going back to the cold is frightening.
She learned of warmth, so warm people are detestable.
...She will not disappear.
She will not be killed.
Because, because...

"Because nothing is my fault."

Right, everyone else is at fault.
She did not wish for such a thing.
It turned out this way because nobody helped her.
Nobody helped her, so that must mean they affirm her.
They didn't object. That's the same as agreeing with her.
...So.
No one can punish her.

"I won't die. It won't end up as Nee-san plans."
...No.
In reality, she will not die.
Nobody can kill her.
Even if someone still wants to try, that's fine.
If she is to be killed, she will rather .

Not only her older sister.
She will be merciless, even to her Senpai.
...Yes.
If he will turn away from her in disgust, then she would rather...
She would rather   like she does in her nightmare

"Ahhaa, ugh!"
She coughs violently.
The pain turns her wild imagination to blood, and she coughs it out.

"......No. I can't, Senpai."
They do not connect.
She cannot tell the difference between good and evil.
She cannot tell what's good.
She's about to lose her mind, not knowing who she is or how long she can stay sane.

"Hello. Are you still conscious of yourself, Sakura?"
Then.
Before she notices, the silver-haired girl is before her.
The same girl as her.
The white girl who is to become the container, who was not treated as a human being.

"Saber, Lancer, Caster, Berserker.
 It would've been fine with just these four. Where did you consume such a soul, Sakura? I'm surprised it's already sufficient when Assassin and Rider are still left."
...She doesn't understand.
She has heard from her grandfather that the girl is just like her, a container that collects the souls of the defeated Servants.
But she has not heard about any Servants being defeated other than the ones just mentioned...

"It's fine. I won't ask, since it means I don't have to worry about the Archer in me being taken away.
 But, Sakura. Do you know what's going to happen to you?"

...Her head cools down.
Her mind, delirious with fever, regains "Matou Sakura" with those words.

"I don't know. What will happen to me?"
The white girl shuts her mouth.
Einzbern's Master.
She was meant to be a vessel from the beginning, unlike the fake, Matou Sakura.
"You'll die. You can't be saved, no matter what."
And the girl tells her about the destiny that awaits them both.
I go to the living room.
"Huh? Did you come in from the entrance-side hallway?"
Ilya is sitting alone in the living room.

"Yeah. I was outside for a bit. Did anything happen while I was gone?"
"Nothing happened. But you have to stay in your room and rest, Shirou.
 Your body is as bad as Sakura's."

"Thanks. But I'm fine as long as the cloth is on."
"Geez, you'll easily faint if you're talking like

 Shirou. Did something happen outside?"

"No, not really."
"No way! I don't know what you went to do, but don't talk to me with such empty eyes!"

"Oh"
She scolded me.
...I see. I must've looked ridiculous.
It can't be helped if that's the case.

"I'm sorry. I know it does no good to worry, but I had to think."
I shake my head.
Like Ilya says, I can't empty my head.
I can't go see Sakura with a miserable face, so I have to show some spirit!

"Yeah, good. It seems you've cheered up.
 So, what do you want to ask about? I'll help you, if that's all right with you."


...Crap.
Ilya sometimes gets really kind.
This is the second time she's helped me when I'm feeling down.
I can't tell which of us is the older one.

"Okay. Can I ask you something, Ilya?"
"All right, I'll tell you anything. What do you want to know?"

"...The Holy Grail. Tell me about the Einzbern's Holy Grail."
"...I see, so you found out, huh? There were two things I didn't want you to find out, and that was one of them."

"Ilya. Then..."
"Yeah, I'm the Holy Grail. I'm not human. I'm a homunculus made that way."

Homunculus
An alchemical formula to create life without a womb, using sperm and other elements.
They are not born from a proper reproductive system, and therefore have physical defects.
Small bodies. Short lives. Lack of intelligence. Lack of reproductive functions.
They have human shapes and human lives, but they are not human, and therefore are completed with a powerful Magic Circuit.

They are weak as a life form.
But they far exceed human powers when they are made as magino, as Magic Circuits

"Well, so that's it.
 The Einzbern family raised me to function as both a Holy Grail and a Master.
 The function of the Holy Grail is to collect the souls of defeated heroic spirits. Humans, coffins, stew pot, it doesn't matter what it's made of as long as it has that special function. It just has to be a sufficiently large container of souls."

Ilya sounds like she's not interested.
Butthis is the first time I've heard that the Holy Grail collects Servants.

"Well, it's more like retrieving them than collecting them.
 Servants are summoned by the Holy Grail. Then it's natural that they return through the Holy Grail after they're defeated. I'm the only Holy Grail of Einzbern, so I should have collected all of them."

"...But it seems there's someone else that's functioning as a Holy Grail.
 It took Caster and Lancer when I noticed, and its drawing power was greater.
 So it took most of the Servants.
 ......I was able to collect Archer because he disappeared right in front of me."

...It doesn't even need to be said.
The other Holy Grail is Sakura.
According to Ilya, Sakura has already taken in Caster and Lancer... as well as Saber and Berserker.

"Four Servants' worth of souls. But can you hold such a thing?  Isn't it a general rule that the human body can only contain one soul?"

"Yes, all the more so if it's the soul of a heroic spirit.
 The magical energy of a Servant that lost its 'shell' called class is enormous. Having one in your body is like creating a typhoon in your body.
 But it's the function of the Holy Grail to collect seven in the end.
 There's no space for the soul of the container itself."

"That's why all the Holy Grails until now were inorganic substances without souls. The function of the Holy Grail is to collect the souls of all seven Servants, then to unify and manage them.
 You don't need extra programs in there. The personality of the Holy Grail will only be erased by the function of the Holy Grail."

"In short, Shirou. The Holy Grail loses its human functions the more complete it gets.
 The same goes for me. Once I collect many Servants, I have to cut off my functions as a human being to control the souls."

"I can manage them if I cut off the energy that moves my limbs.
 I won't let the souls out if I stop breathing.
 I can stabilize the integration of the souls if I use all the power I've used to construct my human form."

"That's the same for Sakura. You can't function as a human once you become a Holy Grail. You don't have the power to spare."

"......But, yes.
 If there is a difference between us, it's that I can switch at will, but Sakura is forced to. Sakura is an incomplete black Holy Grail, so she has no right to refuse."

Ilya shows no emotion as she continues.
...She knew it.
She probably knew it since the time she was born, no, even before she was born.
She knew that her life was made for such a stupid reason.


But there's something I can be glad about.
I place my hand on my tense chest and look up at the heavens, as if in thanks.

"What's wrong, Shirou? I said Sakura can't be saved."
I know.
I know that, but...

"You two are sharing them between you two, right? Then you're still..."
"Hm, yeah. Sakura took most of it, so there's no problem in me staying as myself. Rider and Assassin. Even if I collect their souls, I don't need to cut off my functions as a human being."

...Yes, that's fortunate.
If I lose Ilya as well, it will mean I can't protect anybody

"Eh, eh, Shirou...!?"
Before I know it, I'm embracing Ilya.
I can't promise her anything, and it's not like I want something.

"Shirou..."

Her body is small, so I can't hold her too tightly.
I just touch her, holding her in my arms.
I let my fingers feel the weight of what I must protect.
It's almost two o'clock.
It's late, but I decide to make lunch and take it to Sakura's room.

"Well."
I take off my apron and put the rice porridge on a tray.
I take a deep breath.
And I fill my heart with ice.

I don't know what I'll say if I go see Sakura in this condition.
I can't do that.
If Sakura figures out that I'm troubled, she'll just be even more troubled herself.

I have to freeze my emotions so that I don't reveal anything.
...This will the last time.
This will be the last time we will be together to just casually see each other's faces.
I want our precious time together to end in laughter.

"Are you awake, Sakura? It's late, but let's eat lunch."
I knock and enter her room.
It seems Sakura was sleeping, but her face brightens up as soon as I enter.
"Yes. I'm glad you came, Senpai."
She happily smiles.

Time passes.
Sakura is getting better.
She can sit up on her own, and she even ate the rice porridge without assistance.

Lunch ends and we talk about meaningless things.
Apparently sleepy after eating, Sakura continues to talk while lying in bed.
That's it.
That's all we can do right now.

Sakura seems well.
She's breathing normally, and her cheeks are red and healthy-looking.
I can believe that she won't last even a few more days.

"But I've rarely caught colds.
 I have a healthy body, and I've never had to stay in bed with a fever."

We started with how she dislikes cold medicine, and she's now telling me how healthy she was.
It seems she's never been seriously ill, and I hear she cured any cold symptoms with her spirit.

"Spirit? You mean you warmed yourself up and rested?
 ...No, that's not what spirit means. How can you have spirit during a cold?"
"Oh, um... it's an embarrassing story, so it's a secret."

Sakura laughs in embarrassment.
...Hm. It seems Sakura was an energetic child in her own way.

"So it's not that I dislike cold medicine, but it's that I can't trust it. Don't you get nervous because you can't tell the effect of the medicine?"

"Oh, I guess it was like that when I was a kid. I didn't get well even after I drank this bitter medicine, so I blamed the pain and the fever on it."

Sakura happily agrees.
...Seeing her smile makes me imagine that she's getting better and that she'll be up and well tomorrow.


...I silence my all too convenient wish.
Sakura won't get well.
I can't postpone my decision, believing that everything will turn out fine once she gets better.

"Hey, Sakura."
Maybe it's because I've accepted the cold reality.
"What do you want to do once you get better?"
I ask her about a what-if.
I ask her about a convenient future.

"Eh...? What I want to do...?"
"Yeah. Something that's fun for you. Anything's fine. I'm just asking, so don't worry about if it's possible or not."
"Ehhmm, hold on."
Sakura looks around, troubled.

After some pondering...
"I guess I don't have anything.
 I'm fine how things are right now, and just being with you is good enough."
Sakura blushes.


My vision narrows.
I have to keep my feelings frozen.

'She has never done anything for herself.'

Damn old bastard! It's not that she hasn't done anything...!
She just doesn't know how.
Fun things.
She doesn't know what she wants because she's never known a normal life.
She's never known normal happiness, so she values such trivial things

"...Senpai? Um, is something wrong...?"
"Huh? Oh, I was just thinking to myself."

She hasn't done anything yet.
Sakura doesn't know what she should have, what she should obtain.

Sakura doesn't smile outside.
Sakura doesn't make friends.
A closed world, consisting of my house and the Matou's.
But if I can change it, I'll pay any price

"S-Senpai...? Um, you're acting strange.
 ...Does your left hand hurt?"
"No, it's not that.
 Sakura. Let's go somewhere far away once this is all over.
 We've never gone anywhere for fun, right? It's good to go off and enjoy ourselves once in a while."


Sakura blankly stares at me.
It looks like she's surprised, like she thinks it's all a dream.

"It's decided. Where do you want to go, Sakura?"
"Ehum, where? Um"
She thinks in confusion.
She doesn't answer for a while.
But she must have found a wish she wants with all her heart.

"...Um. It can be anything, right?"
Sakura timidly looks up at me.

"Yeah. There's nowhere you can't go if you put your mind to it."
I'm serious, but it seems she took it as a joke.
Sakura smiles with relief.
"Then I want to go cherry blossom viewing."
And she makes a trivial wish.

"Cherry blossom viewing? You mean that cherry blossom viewing?"
"Yes. We can do it here, but there are only plum trees here. I want to go cherry blossom viewing in a big field on a sunny day."

"I see. That certainly..."
...Sounds really fun.
It'll be great to watch cherry blossoms under a clear blue sky at the park by the bridge.
There are many fun things.
Starting out with cherry blossom viewing suits Sakura.

"All right. Then it's a promise. Let's go there together once you get well and once this whole mess is over."
Sakura shows a satisfied smile.
I make the promise and stand up.

......Yes.
How great will it be if we can really do that?
I imagine my own happiness that I've never imagined since the fire ten years ago.

I leave her room.
All that's left is a trivial promise.
It's not just Sakura's wish.
This promise, which can be fulfilled come April, is my wish as well.


I dream of a warm fantasy with a frozen mind.

Once winter is over.
Once spring arrives, we'll go view the cherry blossoms together
The door closes.
The boy, who said he'd protect the girl as if trying to convince himself, left after making sure she fell asleep.

"............Haa."
The girl, Matou Sakura, painfully moans in the darkness.
She is not asleep.
She only pretended to be asleep so that the boy, who was more tired than her, can rest.

Andshe cannot afford to sleep anymore.
She'll see that dream if she sleeps.
She'll see something similar to her kill people.
It's frightening.
She doesn't remember what kind of dream she had last night.
She doesn't remember why she was unconscious outside.

Soit feels like she will never wake up again if she falls asleep tonight.
She will end up betraying the boy who held her close.
The boy threw away his self and believed in the weak and sly Matou Sakura.
His decision is still hurting her heart, so she will not be able to see him again if she turns out to be like the dream.

Yes.
She has destroyed his mind to the point that it cannot be fixed.
So she has to bear it.
She has to stay conscious, not sleep, and never see that dream again.
A person exists that will protect her.
Even if she may be dirty and cowardly, she has to maintain control with all her might while she still remains.

"I'm fine with that. But..."
...There's something that cannot be returned.
She has committed a crime that she cannot atone for with the life that remains to her.

    'I'll protect you.'

He repeated it, knowing there's no hope or future.
Recalling it makes her cry.
...Half an hour ago.
She was determined when he came to her room.
She knows that he came to kill her.
She's sensitive to the hostility of others. Even if someone comes to kill her in her sleep, she will notice.

...But the hostility was empty.
It's not that he's not feeling anything.
It was a painful emptiness, as if there was a big hole in his chest with cold wind blazing through it.
That made her accept death.
She thought the best possible outcome would be if the boy were the one to stop her.

"y."
But she was a coward, as she had known.
She was ready for death, but she could not stop trembling.
And...
She cornered him by saying something selfishly convenient.

"rry."
He embraced her.
The boy still embraced her.
They both knew there was no future.
But he still put his arms around her, knowing fully well what awaited them in the end.

The boy still had determination.
His embracing arms told her that he will accept the crime she committed and will commit.

"...rry, Senpai"
That's why it's sad.
He can do it.
She knew that from the start.
...The school in the sunset.
The person that kept on running.
The boy that changed her voice from "give up" to "keep going".

She has wished from that time.
To be with him.
To be protected by him.
Admiring him for no reason, she went to his house like her grandfather told her and made her wish come true.

'I'll protect you. I swore to be your superhero.'

"......!"
This is the result.
As his life goes on, he will only continue to break down.

"Sorry... I'm sorry, Senpai"
What she admired...
She finally understands why.
The boy was beautiful in her eyes.
He's different from her, who is a coward.
She wished for him to keep his upstanding character.

"But I"
...Yes, she remembers.
She wanted to protect him.
She wanted to protect the boy.
She wanted to protect the clumsy, but upright boy that she found in the setting sun.
"I broke it."

That's all she wished for.
So why...
Why did it turn out like this?

...And then.
The girl makes her final resolution.

"You're there, right, Rider?"
She calls out into the darkness.

The girl should be the only one here, but a woman appears like a ghost.
It is Matou Sakura's Servant, Rider.

"...I thought so. Were you guarding me?"
"Yes. Had he tried to take your life, I would have killed him."

...She sighs, thinking it was close.
Rider puts priority on her master.
Her decision is based solely on whether that person will kill her Master, Matou Sakura.
In that regard, Emiya Shirou was Rider's enemy back then.

"...Don't do anything to him, Rider. I won't forgive you if you hurt him."
"My role is to protect you. If he is to be your enemy, I must fulfill my mission. I will protect you, no matter what you may become."
"...Do you mean that, even if I turn into something other than myself?"

There's no reply.
It's something she shouldn't say, the worst possible scenario.
...Yes.
Even if Emiya Shirou sides with Matou Sakura.
If Matou Sakura recognizes Emiya Shirou as her enemy, he will become a foreign foe that must be defeated.

"............"
The girl raises her body and clenches her fists.
...Rider's statement hasn't angered her.
She's just scared that the assumption might become a reality.

"...Sakura?
 What are you doing? You cannot use magic with that body of yours!"
Ignoring Rider, the girl raises her hand in the darkness.

The magical energy runs through it for only an instant.
When the light fades, the only thing different is her left hand.
"Sakura."
"...This is my last Command Spell. Please, Rider. Please protect Senpai until the end, no matter what happens in the future."
The girl gives her final order.
The Command Spell is gone from Matou Sakura's hand.

"...I'll stop Grandfather.
 This is a problem between me and the Matou family. ...I know it's too late, but I can't cause any more trouble."
The girl holds her chest as she coughs.
...Her eyes light up in the darkness.
They are weak, but they are eyes of determination that belong to a magus.
I told you to stop with the scary stories!

Oh, you don't like scary stories, master?

No, I hate them. They might take my belly button, so I'm gonna go home.

Hey, you can't do that, Taiga. You're the master, so you have to teach.
What will you do if a challenger comes to this dojo?

They won't come. I've been in this dojo for ten years, but such a person never came.
So I'm gonna go home. I have a bad feeling.

Why speak with a Kansai dialect...?
Huh? Master, there's a challenger.

All right, send him home.

Why!? You'd usually say something like...

'All right! I never thought I'd see a challenger while I was alive!'
 And jump around with joy like a junkie!

I'm saying I have a bad feeling.
First of all, I have a bad feeling from the

 name of this dead end...

...Sac... rifice......

IT'S HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!
NO, I CAN'T STAND MYSTERIOUS THINGS LIKE THIS!!!

Oh, I know this. This is called mixed martial arts, right?

All right, do your best, Tiger!

I can't!

Here, your opponent is that buruma girl. Her moe power is ten times stronger than mine. You should be fully satisfied.

...Eat... the hakama...

Whoa, go away, evil spirit!
Someone go get sec*m!

Starting now is the match, Taiga VS the black shadow!
It seems the black shadow is dominating, but Taiga is turning defiant.

Oh she bit it! Taiga is being swallowed, but is trying to swallow it back!

She's fighting it...!
Master can match it...!

Guaaa! God of Babylonia, give me your powers!

Well, I don't really care.
You'll just end up losing even if you fight that thing, so don't even think about it, okay, Shirou?

What you have to do is to figure out what the shadow is.

No pain, no gain.
Go back to the previous choice and go with Assassin's invitation.

Noooo, I can't! I'm tapping! Hey, referee, I'm tapping out!

Bye!
I'll be the master in the next Tiger Dojo if everything goes well!
"H-He's dead...!"
The impossible has occurred.
The door was locked from the inside when Fujimura-san went into the room.
The only ones in the room are me, Fujimura-san, and Lady Ilya.

"But how...!? There's no one in this room other than us!"
"There are two ways.
 One is an accident with lack of affection points.
 The victim had a low Sakura-chan affection score, so he mistook the ornamental guillotine for the bed, and he went to sleep."

"I see. It seems very unlikely, but it's certainly possible.
 That kind of taste is expected from Sakura."
I see.
Sakura's taste sure is troublesome.
So the bed turned into a guillotine the instant someone got on it!

"Yes. So the solution would be to start over from day 9 and increase Sakura-chan's affection points.
 The other method is a direct offense brought on by an external factor.
 The victim was also the assailant.
 He tried to kill Sakura-chan here. But he was killed instead because the knife-throwing security system was set off"

"Mississippi system, huh? Setting such a scary trap... Sakura is a scary girl...!"

Their speculation heats up.
But I think of another method that doesn't fall under either scenario.
It goes like this.
Going back to yesterday morning.
What if my death was determined the instant I said "no" to Tohsaka-san's question...?
"Anyway, the case is solved.
 Let's go, Lady Ilyasviel. We can leave the rest to the police and get away from this haunted mansion."
"......Okay. But this case left a bad aftertaste."

The actors leave.
The only one left on the stage is me, the corpse.
The conclusion is...
I wish they'd never again do a one-time ridiculous Tiger Dojo that has no logical solution.

I wake up up at the same time as usual.
It's before six o'clock.
The day is dawning, and the sky is filled with gray clouds again.

I don't feel any pain from my left arm.

There's no one in the living room.
I should make breakfast before Tohsaka wakes up.

The news is on.
It's becoming my daily routine to check the news in the morning.

"There aren't any big stories. I guess it didn't appear last night."
She must mean the black shadow.
"Yeah. I guess it doesn't come out every day."
I answer, careful not to let my relief show.

"Yeah. I wouldn't be able to bear hundreds of people getting hurt two days in a row."

It's past seven.
Tohsaka and I are the only ones in the living room.
Sakura and Ilya are both sleeping.
I wanted Ilya to wake up and come, but Tohsaka told me that she's tired and I should let her rest.

"So you should rest too, in preparation for tonight."
Tohsaka says this out of the blue.
"...Why?"

"It's the creation of our secret weapon. We'll complete the framework today, so we'll do the projection tonight.
 We'll go settle our match with Zouken as soon as we succeed. We can't allow any more victims. No matter what that shadow may be, the Holy Grail War will end once we defeat Zouken. The mysterious shadow should disappear then."

"Tohsaka. You really think the shadow will disappear once the war is over?"

"It will.  Whatever it is, I'm sure it appeared because of the Holy Grail.
 I don't know if it wants the Holy Grail, or if the Holy Grail summoned it. But either way, it's here because of the Holy Grail, so it'll disappear once the Holy Grail is gone.
 In short, the shadow will disappear once the war ends.
 That will happen when the time limit expires, when only one Master remains, orwhen the Holy Grail's vessel dies."

"Tohsaka, you"
...Already...
Knew what that shadow is?

"I'm just guessing.
 It might not disappear even if we defeat Zouken.
 It might not disappear even when the war ends.
 So I'm going to take the surest method. We can't rely on uncertainties like obtaining the Holy Grail ourselves. We have to take down both Zouken and the shadow with our own powers."

Tohsaka gets up.
I don't know why, but she takes the water jug and pajamas I prepared for Sakura.

"Hey, what are you doing?"
"I'll go see how Sakura's doing. Her room is next to mine, so I'm in a better position to look after her."
"Heyno, I'll take care of Sakura."

"Don't be stupid. You didn't get any sleep last night, did you? Can't you tell that you'll be a liability in your condition?"
...?
I didn't get any sleep?

"Don't be stupid. I slept last night."
"I don't believe this. You're so tired that you don't even notice it?
 ...Geez, go look at the mirror if you think I'm lying. If you went to nurse Sakura with dark circles around your eyes and looking pale, it'd just make her worried."
"Whatare you serious?"

"Why would I lie? Geez, just go to your room and rest. I'll go get you in the afternoon.
 Oh, and if you can't go to sleep, I can help you. If you don't mind me copying Rider, I can put you under for about a day."

Copying Rider means copying her mystic eyes. But as far as I know, Tohsaka doesn't have mystic eyes.
In short, she's...

"Are you telling me to be your guinea pig?"
"Exactly. I wasn't interested before, but mystic eyes might not be that bad. I can't do anything on that scale, but I might be able to do something like sleep suggestion."

"Don't lie. What was that about them not being bad?
 You just don't want to stay defeated, so you want to learn it too, right?"

"J-Just be quiet! So, what about it?
 Do you want to try it or not?"
"No, you idiot! I'm having nothing to do with such a dangerous experiment. First of all, if I sleep for a day, I can't wake up until tomorrow morning."

"Oh, right. It'll be paralysis instead of sleep if it works too well. I think it'll work well on you since you're simple-minded."
Tohsaka seems to be convinced.
I want to object, but I stay quiet since she might test it on me if I do object.

"Well, I'm not that sensitive, so I can sleep if I want. You don't have to worry about me."
"Really? Then can you rest in your room and let me handle Sakura's care?"
...Then.
Tohsaka drops her joking manner and asks me with serious eyes.


I can't answer right away.
...I want to be with Sakura.
But I have other things to do, and I can't let Sakura see me if I look as terrible as Tohsaka says.
I can trust Tohsaka with Sakura's care, so I'll take her offer.

"...You're right. Then I'll be in my room.
 I'll bring her lunch and dinner, so can you take care of her the rest of the time?"
"Yeah, you can leave her to me. I'll scold her and put her back in bed if she tries to get up.
 So, can you really sleep by yourself? Don't you want to try it out once?"

"You're persistent. I don't want anything dangerous.
 But thanks, Tohsaka. I'm sorry for making you look out for me."
"I-I'm not looking out for you. I-I'm going, so you go sleep, okay!?"

Tohsaka leaves in a hurry.
...Man.
I don't know if she's perceptive or not, nor if she's a good person or a cold person.
I hear geniuses tend to leave everyone else behind them, and I'm guessing that's Tohsaka's type.
Sakura has it tough. I'd never have peace of mind if Tohsaka were my older sister.

"Well, I bet every day would be fun, though."
...Right.
That's why I want them back to being sisters as quickly as possible.

Sakura and Tohsaka can be together again once the war ends, and the promise between their families goes away.
The eleven-year gap won't be bridged that easily, but I want them to get close enough to laugh together over trivial matters.

I'll do anything to help.
I think this is the most I can do for Sakura.

"Oh, and for Tohsaka too. Sakura is like the only one who can make her look troubled."
Oh, crap.
I just imagined Tohsaka smiling happily.
I'm sorry, Sakura. Wait, does this count as being unfaithful?

"No, more importantly..."
I can't take it easy forever.
Tohsaka said she'll challenge Zouken tonight.
...That's bad.
The war will end if we defeat Zouken.
The Holy Grail will appear once the war ends.
No, rather, the Holy Grail will be opened.

Zouken said the Holy Grail is a gate.
What grants the wishes is not the Holy Grail, but what's inside of it.
...If that's true, what will happen to Sakura, who is the Holy Grail?
Ilya said that...
Sakura loses her human functions as she nears completion as a Holy Grail.

"!"
...So there's only one way to save Sakura.
Protect her until the Holy Grail War ends.
I don't know how the Holy Grail will appear.
I don't know if it appears when there's only one Master left, or if the last Master summons it.

...There's no problem if it's the latter.
I just have to defeat Zouken, eliminate what's threatening Sakura, and wait for the duration of the war.

Tohsaka said we'll challenge Zouken tonight.
Then we can beat Zouken.
If she says we're fighting, that means we have a high chance of winning.

"...Then there's only one problem."
...The black shadow.
Beating Zouken won't make it disappear.
It will continue to surface as long as the Holy Grail, Sakura, exists.
And it will take many lives every time.
Waiting for the deadline means doing nothing about that shadow.

"...I have to defeat it. I have to defeat the shadow myself."
...That's the only possible choice.
But can I beat it?
If that thing came from the Holy Grail, the shadow should not have a concept of death.
If I'm to eliminate it, I have to eliminate the projector, Sakura herself, or destroy the main body that's sending magical energy to the projector.

"...Main body, huh...?"
...I don't think such a thing exists.
But I can't come up with any effective plans unless I assume so.

"The content of the Holy Grail.
 Zouken implanted within Sakura a piece of the Holy Grail that was shattered in the previous war. Did it contain anything back then?"
Oh.
Wait a minute.
Zouken said he made the crest worm from a piece of the Holy Grail

"Kotomine. He didn't notice that...!?"
No way...!
He extracted some crest worm from Sakura.
He removed just a small quantity, but he treated Sakura's body.

There's no way he wouldn't notice.
He's the supervisor of the Holy Grail War, and he was one of the last surviving Masters in the previous war.
Then he should know what's wrong with her body...!

"Haa!"
I run out the door.
Compelled by the sudden insight, I can only think about the priest.

"Damn, why didn't I realize earlier...!?"
If I'd just thought about it, I would've seen it right away.
The shadow that appears as Sakura's subconscious form.
That man should know what's inside the Holy Grail!
"What?"
The first thing I feel after returning home is an icy chill.
Nothing's wrong, and there's no sign of danger.
But I have a bad feeling.

There's nobody in the living room.
Ilya is sleeping in her room.
Tohsaka is preparing for the projection in her room.
Sakura is

"I'm coming in, Sakura."
I call out and place my hand on the doorknob.
I feel a cold sensation on my back.
I shake off my uneasiness and open the door.

"Sakura."
"......!"
I see Rider for a second, but her figure disappears.
Behind her...
The bed which Sakura should be in is empty.

"!"
The light turns on.
"Wha"
I look around in surprise.
"Welcome back. I won't ask where you were, but you certainly took your time."

"Tohsaka...? What is this?"
"Isn't it obvious? Sakura went out by herself, and Rider has been glaring at me until now.
 ...I guess she's under orders not to hurt you. She switched to spirit form and ran out as soon as you came in."

"Wha"
Tohsaka sounds calm.
...No, that's not it.
Her voice doesn't sound calm.
Her tone is one of cold disinterest, as if she's given up on something.

"Tohsaka. Sakura really went out...?"
"It's true. She was gone before you left, so it's already been two hours.
 I don't know what her intentions are, but I guess she doesn't want to follow our directions. She had Rider stop me from going after her, so she must not want us to know what she's doing."

"Don't be stupid...! Sakura wouldn't hide things... from... us"
I can't say for certain.
...Sakura's nightmare.
I have no idea what Sakura thought about her deteriorating body.

"We have to bring her back...! If we leave her alone, it'll..."
"There may be victims. She might drain magical energy from anyone she sees, like when she attacked me at school.
 No one was attacked by the shadow last night, right? So she must be hungry."

"Tohsaka."
Tohsaka looks away and swallows her words.
Her eyes say to give up, telling me it's all over.

"Tohsaka, you..."
"We can look for Sakura. I agree with that.
 Butonce we find her... You know what to do if Sakura isn't herself anymore, right?"

"That's not possible. Sakura will always be Sakura."
"Are you insane? Can't you tell she's at her limit? Give up already, Shirou. If you keep protecting her, you'll be the first one to die"

"We can make stupid speculations later. We need to find Sakura and bring her home right now. After that I'll argue with you as long as you like, so shut up for now...!"
"Hey, wait, Shirou!"

I run through the hallway.
I don't have time to wonder where Sakura went.
'It's over now, Shirou.'

I run outside at full speed, as if denying her words.

"Shirou. Are you going to go look for Sakura?"

Then.
Someone unexpected calls to me from behind.

...When did she come here?
Ilya is watching me from a distance, as if there's a wall between us.

"...Ilya."
"Tell me, Shirou. Are you going to go look for Sakura?"

I nod.
Ilya's voice is tense.
The despair in her voice is different from Tohsaka's. As a Holy Grail, Ilya must understand what condition Sakura is in.

"I see. But Shirou, Sakura went outside by herself because she didn't want you to see her. She's scared and doesn't want to die, but she still chose to end herself in order to protect you.
 The Sakura you like doesn't exist anymore. She went out by herself to eliminate herself."


Ilya looks straight at me.
I meet her gaze and shake my head.
I won't let that happen.
Even if Sakura isn't Sakura anymore, there's only one thing I'm going to do.

"......I see. But Shirou. Both Sakura and I have another self in us. It's probably not the Ilya you know, and it's not the Sakura you know.
 Sakura won't come back. She'll just be a different person after she changes.
 But you still refuse to kill her?"

A quiet question.
This is what Ilya really means.
The Holy Grail is made with the premise of it breaking down.
So I don't need to hesitate about destroying it.
But to me, it sounds like she's talking about herself rather than about Sakura.

"Shirou. Let me ask you one more time.
 Are you still going to go look for Sakura?"
"........."
I don't know how much emotion her question carries.
So I honestly tell her the path I chose.

"Yes, I'm going to go look for her. Sakura will always be Sakura to me. The same goes for you. Even if you turn into a mysterious thing like a Holy Grail, you'll still be Ilya."

"...No matter how much you may have changed.
 If Ilya is inside you, you'll be the Ilya I know."


"I don't know about difficult things. That's all I care about."

I put my hand on the door.
"...It's Zouken's place. That's the only place Sakura would go to."
I hear her behind me.
"All right. Please wait here, Ilya. I'll go find Sakura and bring her back right away."

I leave.
Ilya stays standing in the hallway, as if seeing off something very far away.

I reach the Matou household.
I'm not out of breath.
My body has to be tired from all the running, but it doesn't complain to me at all.

"...It's open."
I stop before I ring the doorbell.
...Did someone go in or come out?
The front door is half open, and it's dead quiet inside.

I don't feel any human presence.
The Matou household is gloomier than yesterday.

There's nobody on the first floor.
My footsteps echo through the hallway.
The floor creaks as I make my way to the stairs.

There's nobody on the second floor.
I see the sky through the glass above the landing.
Once I make my way to the top, I'm able to tell that there's no living person on the second floor.

I turn to go back downstairs, but I stop.
A living person.
The strange feeling makes me head to the room with a slightly-opened door.

It's Sakura's room.
I've seen it once before.
But I've never actually gone in there before.
It's because Sakura pushed us out with a red face when Shinji led me here.

I think that was two years ago.
Nothing's changed.
A girl's room. It's a simple room suited for Sakura.
And on the bed...
"Shinji."
...Is the corpse of Matou Shinji.
"...Huh? Is that Shirou that just went outside...?"
Tohsaka Rin wonders about the sound from the front door.
She looks out the window and, sure enough, sees him running down the hill.

"That idiot...! I told him to rest, but he never listens to people...!"
She stops filling prescriptions and gets up.
Sakura's medicine is important, but stopping Shirou comes first.

"Man, warnings go in one ear and out the other for him...! He doesn't even realize how exhausted he is...!"
She dashes down the stairs.
She hurries to the entrance to quickly follow after Shirou.

"Oh, before that."
She has to check on Sakura, just in case.
She hasn't given her the water jug or the pajamas, since she was planning to bring them with the medicine. She hasn't taken her temperature either.
Shirou's recklessness angers her, but she can't scold Shirou if she ignores Sakura.

"Well, it seems like she's sleeping."
It's only been a minute.
Shirou should quickly lose his breath, stop, and rest at the bottom of the hill. He shouldn't even be able to run a kilometer in his condition.

"...The worst part is that he doesn't realize it."
If she runs, she can catch up with him in no time.
Of the people in the house right now, she has the most energy.
It's natural that the strongest one looks after the weaker members.

"I'm coming in, Sakura."
She goes in without waiting for a reply.
"I'm going outside. It won't be long, so keep resting. I'll leave your change of clothes here, so
She stops her sentence.
And....
"Crap. You did it, Sakura."
Rin punches the wall hard enough to break it.

Matou Sakura isn't in the room.
The one in bed is not her.

"...You've fallen far, Rider. I never thought I'd see a Servant sleep in a bed, pretending to be her Master."
"I was unwilling, but this is an order.
 But this is your carelessness. Please do not push your responsibility onto me."
"...Well said. She's the one causing us the trouble."
She grits her teeth.
Rin glares at Rider with hostility, and Rider ignores it coolly.

"Tohsaka Rin. If there is a next time, set a better observer. You cannot deceive Sakura with a mere jade bird familiar. She does not match you in ability, but her instincts are as good as yours."
"I see, thanks for the advice. ...But I guess that's not all, huh?"

"Of course not. Sakura instructed me not to let you out of the house until she returns."

Rin clucks her tongue.
She can't do anything now.
By herself, she cannot defeat or escape from Rider.
She can only stay here, just as Sakura planned.

"I'm really pissed. He tried to help her since she can't handle it by herself, but now she's gone alone to settle things?"
"Are you not going to resist? It is good to be graceful, but this is unexpected."
"I just don't have to go outside, right? I can't match you, so I'll stay quiet until she comes home."
She sighs and leans against the wall.

There's no will to fight.
Rin relaxes, looks down, and...
"But Rider. She won't come back. ...No. Even if she does come back, she won't be the Matou Sakura we know."
...Mentions the worst-possible future with the cold voice of a magus.
"Shinji."
Shinji's corpse is on the bed.
There's nothing else.
What happened here?
There's no way I would know, but...
"Sakura."
...Somehow, I can tell that Sakura killed him.

"............"
I can't think.
Shinji's corpse.
Sakura's whereabouts.
It's only been half a day since I embraced Sakura, so how did it end up like this?

"Oh. So it is the Emiya boy.
 I would like to commend you for coming here, but it seems you were a bit too late."

"!"
I turn around at the sudden voice.

"......!"
There's no one behind me.
I know there's nobody in this house.
Zouken's voice is echoing through the room even though he's not here.

"Zouken...! What did you do to Sakura...!?"

"I did nothing. As you can see, my unworthy grandson tried to violate her and was killed instead. It's nothing to make a fuss over.
 Butthis will be the last time I call him an unworthy grandson.
 He was useless, but he fulfilled his role in the end."

He laughs.
I can't see the old magus, but I'm sure he's laughing with a hideous face.

"Shinji's role...?"
"Yes. I cannot make her put her mind to it. She hates me too much. So I had to have you or Shinji break her down.
 I needed Sakura to feel despair in this world to have her accept her own shadow."

"Wha"
"Oh, my. It was my mistake. I took her emotional strength too lightly. I expected her to break easily, but she would never do so on her own.
 It seems torturing her for a long time had its flaw. I did not expect her to become so persistent."

"You"
My nerves condense.
Before I even understand what he's saying, I clench my right fist, open my Magic Circuit, and...

"Well, if I am to be greedy, I wanted you to betray her. She would not have awakened incompletely, but her body and mind would have completely turned into the shadow in that case!
 But that is only a matter of time.
 With Shinji's death, she has finally accepted her position. I need only watch over her now. She will follow her instincts to feed on people, and destroy herself from overeating.
 My work comes after th"

I punch the wall.
With all my might, I lash out at the darkness where the voice is coming from.
I unconsciously fill my hand with magical energy, which is transmitted into the wall and sweeps the darkness from the room.

"My, how frightening. The worms I left to keep watch over this place have been crushed. Haha, soon my voice will no longer reach you."
"Shut up and get out here, Zouken...! I'll rip you to pieces...!"

"Well, I am afraid I cannot do that. The goal the Makiri have sought for five hundred years is within my grasp.
 I cannot be killed now, yet I'm not so ungrateful as to kill you."

"Ungrateful...? Shut up!  When did I do anything for you...!?"

"You did. You raised Sakura. Before, she merely endured, but you taught her how to desire others.
 Yes, I appreciate what you did, Emiya Shirou. This ritual was a success because of you.
 That is why I will not kill you. I need you to see her after she matures...!"

"Zou... ken."
"Kaka, nobody can stop her now. She has killed her brother, so she cannot turn back.
 She will take in Archer's soul from Einzbern's Holy Grail and steal the key to reach the gate.
 That will be the end. Makiri's earnest desire, the reproduction of the Third Sorcery, will be achieved...!"

The annoying laugh echoes through the room.
I

Hold on.
Steal Einzbern's Holy Grail...?
"!"

I run.
I don't care about the laughter.
I'm sure he's watching me from a safe place.
There's no time to let an old man's drivel get to me

"That's right. Hurry, Emiya Shirou!
 Sakura has turned dark. Once she captures Ilyasviel, she will swallow her without mercy...!"
"!"

I kick the ground hard enough to tear my legs off.
"Please be all right, Ilya!"
It'll take twenty minutes to get to my house, even if I run full-speed.
I glare at the gray sky and run frantically back to Ilya.
"Zouken......!!!!"
I'll settle it now.
Zouken should be somewhere in this house. I'll find him and kill him...!

"Damn it, where are you, you old bastard...!?"
I can't find him anywhere in the house.
His presence is fading by the second.
"Oh, my. You must be blinded by your anger.
 I thought you would be smarter."

Even his laughing voice is fading away.

"HaaHaa, haa, ha"
...Zouken's not here.
He wasn't in this house to begin with.
He's a worm user. The only ones here are his worms...!

"Are you satisfied now? Then go home, Emiya Shirou.
 Sakura will soon swallow Ilyasviel. If you do not hurry, you will not be there for the birth of the monster you raised."
"You old bastard...!"

I kick the ground hard enough to rip my legs off.
Giving in to my anger wasted too much time.
It'll take twenty minutes to get to my house, even if I run full-speed.
Will I make it?
I have to head back to my house before Sakura finds Ilya!
The girl is looking up at the sky.
The gray sunlight dulls her silver hair and red eyes.
"...Yeah. I have to tell Shirou once he comes home."
Ilyasviel talks to herself.

The Emiya household is quiet.
Shirou and Rin went to find Sakura.
Rider, naturally, is nowhere to be seen, leaving Ilya as the only one here.
"The giant cavern. The promised land built two hundred years ago. From the feel of it, it's already activated."
This is the fifth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki.
The Holy Grail has been summoned into different places each time, but it has returned to the original site for this war.

It's only natural.
They use one of the gates located at the four compass points, and move on to the next when one fails.
The first was the Ryudou Temple.
The second was the Tohsaka household.
The third was the church on top of the hill.
The fourth was that burned field.
Then this summoning returns to the site of the first.
The point of origin.
The false utopia that sets the rules of the Holy Grail War.

"A Holy Grail filled with the souls of heroic spirits.
 Using it to open the gate is the very miracle they aimed for... But I didn't expect its contents to come out before the gate had been opened."
Ilya murmurs in disbelief.
This is far away from the Einzbern's dearest wish.
They have failed.
The disaster that will be born is a far cry from what they wished for.

"...I can just leave it be. My role is to open it. Nobody told me anything about closing it."
And she couldn't possibly close it, even if she tried.
Matou Sakura excels her in ability as the Holy Grail.
Einzbern's Holy Grail cannot do anything to the gate opened by Makiri's Holy Grail.
Matou Zouken thinks he opened the same gate, but in reality, he opened a completely different one.
The only ones aware of this are the Holy Grails: the girl and Matou Sakura.

"Will Shirou make it? I could run away with him if he does."
She looks up at the sky.
The girl is wavering.
She doesn't know whether to choose the role imposed on her or the desire born from within her.

"But Shirou. It makes no difference to the fact that I'm going to die."
The result is the same.
Regardless of whether she goes to the gate as the Holy Grail or runs away, she will die.
Which is her true self?  She asks the gray sky for an answer.



That's why she doesn't notice.
The person who came through the door with an "I'm home."
Did she slip through the boundary field, or did it not consider her a trespasser?



Slowly.
She moves from the living room to the yard without a sound, then reaches out to the girl sitting at the porch.
"You're home late, Sakura. Where were you?"

"Nee-san..."
The trespasser, Matou Sakura, stops her hand.
She looks away from Ilya and to Tohsaka Rin, who has been waiting for her in the yard.

"Get away from Ilya. I'll shoot you down if you get any closer to her."
Everyone here knows it's no empty threat.
"It's useless. Well, go ahead if it'll satisfy you, Rin."
Ilyasviel starts walking without showing any surprise.
The girl walks to the edge of the yard, as if to watch over the two's confrontation.

"...I see. You were waiting here all along, Nee-san. You knew I was coming for Ilya-chan."
"Yeah. I don't have a reason to save you, unlike Shirou. It was obvious that you'd come to kidnap Ilya when the time came. You've done it once before, so I'd be foolish not to keep an eye on her."

Sakura's brows twitch at Shirou's name.
Showing unhappiness.
She shows undisguised hatred that would surprise anyone who knew her previous self.

"...That's terrible. You're always like that, Nee-san. You always make fun of me. You're beautiful, so you look down on me because I'm dirty.
 You're absolutely hateful. Nee-san. Am I that bad of a person?"
Her voice contains no emotion.
The question alone should send a chill up anyone's spine.

"Of course. You're a big idiot who gave up her chance to be saved the instant she stepped out of this house. You didn't trust the person that Matou Sakura wanted to protect."
But Tohsaka Rin gives a firm reply.

"Oh"
Sakura looks down.
As if acknowledging the truth of her mistake.

"But I..."
"Don't say you thought it was for the best. We told you not to go outside. If you had any objections, you should've come and talked with us first.
 But you went without saying anything. You went alone and made the same mistake you always made.
 Unbelievable. People take advantage of you because you can't do something as simple as that."

"...You're right. I was definitely like that until now.
 But Nee-san. I'm not weak anymore. You're the one who can stay in the house now. I'll protect Senpai."
Her cold stare, the emitting ominous shadow...

Realizing that it's as she feared, Rin takes a step back.

Not knowing...
That her hesitation is the last trigger that drives Matou Sakura.

"...What's wrong, Nee-san? Curling your back like that makes it look like you're scared of me."

It's too late when she clucks her tongue.
......No.
It's not too late or anything.
When Sakura reached for Ilyasviel, it was already too late.

"......I see. So you don't intend to stay quietly in your room anymore?"
"No. I don't need to listen to what you say anymore."

"Because I'm stronger."

The shadow dances.
Many shades of darkness emerge from the ground below Sakura and engulf the yard.
And from the shadow...
"Sakura, you"
...Emerges a swordsman who is contaminated in black.

"Saber, capture the Holy Grail. If she tries to resist, go as rough as you like."

Black Saber obeys without a word.
...There's no doubt about it.
What that shadow is.
Tohsaka Rin bites her lip, seeing what kind of fate awaits a Servant swallowed by the mud.

At that instant.
"!"
"Hah!"
A merciless attack.
A shadow with magical energy far surpassing that of Tohsaka Rin is fired.

"......!"
She rolls as she lands.
The fired shadow is on the same level as the black shadow.
It'll be the end if it touches her.
If it even grazes her, it will stick to her skin, covering her in an instant.
And after that.
If Tohsaka Rin is swallowed by the mud that even a Servant cannot escape, she will be absorbed without hope of resistance.

"Damn......!"
The black tentacles whip towards her in rapid succession.
Rin realizes that the attacks are not from the black shadow, but a magic Sakura possesses.
That magic of Matou is to bind others.
But Sakura is originally from the Tohsaka familya shadow-user with an origin of the imaginary element, the imaginary number.
Matou Sakura is able to embody the black shadow to that degree because she has both of those attributes!

"......!!!!"
She's easily cornered.
Their magical energy capacities are too unevenly matched.
Sakura's magical energy is infinite.
Her capacity reaches a hundred million.
To Rin, whose capacity is a mere three hundred, Sakura is a monster.

She controls both the black shadow and Saber, who has the greatest magical energy out of all the Servants.
...Even a Servant will not be able to match such a monstrous magus.

".........This is bad. Her magic's simple, but our energy capacity is too different"
She stares at what Sakura has become, gasping for breath.
...She has no chance of winning, and she cannot escape.
It'd be a different story if she had a source of magical energy like the Holy Grail, but she doesn't have such a thing.

"...Well, no magical energy source in the world can match the Holy Grail."
She suppresses her frustration by grumbling.
"Oh, you can't do that, Nee-san. It's dangerous if you stop there."
Sakura points her hand at Rin without hesitation.

There's no mercy.
Sakura smiles, enjoying the absolute dominance.
"Nowlet's play more, Nee-san.
 I know you'll be caught in the end, but please keep running until then."
She smiles at her beloved sister.

The result is as obvious as she says.
Rin cannot get away from the shadow.
Sakura can quickly cover the whole house with the shadow if she wishes.
As Sakura slowly expands the extent of the shadow, Rin is defeated without being able to do anything.

"Ah, ah............"
The black shadow covers Tohsaka Rin.
The gel-like mud tightly binds Rin's body, turning into numerous tongues to invade her Magic Circuit.

"Oh, is that all?  You're not as strong as I thought, Nee-san."
She looks down at her helpless sister.
Wild breathing and heated cheeks.
Her older sister is covered with heavy oil, exciting even Sakura, who is of the same sex.

"Sa... kura"
Her face is left uncovered, perhaps because Sakura wants to enjoy her pain.
"You........."
Rin swallows her contempt and glares back at Sakura.
But that's only for a few seconds.
The mud that stirs her body violates her internal organs.

"Kuh...! Ahh, haa........."
"Fufu. Then I'll be having you now. I was looking forward to this. This will be the first time I've eaten magical energy from a magus."
The gel-like shadow tightens around Tohsaka Rin.
The "meal" doesn't even last a second.

"Ah...... Hm"
"......It's good. I'm not full at all, but it helps a bit."
The last traces of magic fade from Tohsaka Rin.
That's the end.
Head down and chest heaving, Rin has no power to resist.
She has no way to fight back, but

"That won't do. I have to kill her here, or I..."
Will lose to Nee-san.
...It's a groundless assumption.
The difference in their powers will never be overturned.
But Sakura is firmly convinced that she will lose if they fight again.

So she has to kill her here.
Taking her magical energy and leaving her powerless isn't enough.
She has to kill Rin here, just as Rin tried to do to her.
She tries to convince herself as she opens her palms.

"Nee-san, you"
The shadow doesn't extend.
She trembles, gaze focused on her weakened sister, and...
"Sakura!!!!!!"
The person she least wants to see catches up to her.
Ahhaa, haa ha

My chest hurts.
My heart has been sending me a danger signal for a while now.
Thump, thump, splat, thump.
The heart spits out blood to the rest of the body, raging around as though saying it'll  if it moves anymore.

Ahhaa, haa, ha

My throat hurts.
It feels like I'm swallowing needles every time I take a breath.
So it's too scary to breathe.
I'm already oxygen-deprived, so intentionally limiting my breathing is like suicide.

Ahhaa, haa ha

My limbs don't move well because they lack oxygen.
I made it this far with unsteady steps, but I might fall unconscious at any time.

Fuh, kuh...!

That thought brings back my strength.
I can't fall here.
Sneaking out would become meaningless.
I need to settle my match.
I have to stop the old man that made me a Master, even if it costs me my life.

HaaHaa, ha

...I steady my breathing.
It's fine, it's not hard.
It might be hard for others, but it's no problem for me.
I just have to look at him, like I do every night at dinner, and shake my head.
Andthat old man's scheme will end.

...I don't think about what'll happen to me after I disobey the monster.
If I do, I won't be able to go through with it.
So I stop thinking too much.
Fortunately, the memory in my head is vague.
I won't remember what I'm doing now in the next instant, so the fear is relatively small.

I walk through my house, which I haven't been in for a few days.
A dark house.
I look through my scattering memory, but can't remember the house ever being bright.
It's just like always.
It's damp, degenerate, and viscous like always.

But

"No waywhy?"

But it's not as expected.
Grandfather's presence is not in the house.
The worms' presence cannot be felt anywhere.

"...Haaah, ahh..."
I hold myself upright and look around the empty living room.
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.
That old man is not in the house.
His laughing voice is not in the basement.

"...No way... Why?"
It doesn't make sense.
GrandfatherMatou Zouken wants me back.
But he couldn't do anything until now because I was at the Emiya household.
So now should be his best chance.
He will definitely come and try to turn me into a Holy Grail if I'm alone.
So why isn't he coming out?

"Ah... haa... haa... ah"
...My consciousness is fading away.
...That's bad.
I have to see Matou Zouken before I fall asleep, before Senpai goes into action.
I have to see him and end it right now.
It'll all be over once I see him, so why isn't he appearing today of all days!?

"...He should know...!"
Right, there's no way he doesn't know.
He's always watching me. He can find me, no matter where I hide or how far I run.
He knows he can easily catch and control me.
...He never considers the possibility that I might resist.
He only treats me as a tool.

"......So... why?"
There's no way he doesn't know.
It shouldn't even matter that the priest removed some of my crest worm.
...Because that's just insurance.
He's watching my actions using a more reliable method.
He knows my current condition. He's even listening to my heartbeat.
He knows I'm alone here and that I left Rider behind.
Because he's

"Sakura."
A voice comes from right behind me.
And...
"...Nii-san?"
Right when I realize it's Nii-san and turn around...
I don't stop until I reach the church.
I was breathing hard when I was running down the hill, but my fatigue went away by the time I got to the intersection.

"HaaHaa, haa."
Even I'm surprised by how well I'm doing.
Even though I took the shortest route, I ran full speed for five kilometers from my house to the church.

"Wait, this is no time to be amazed at myself."
I head to the entrance.
I pull myself together, readying myself to have Kotomine talk if he knows everything.

"!"
The priest is in the chapel.

It seems like he's been waiting for me...
"Oh, what's wrong, Emiya Shirou? I did not think you were admirable enough to come pray to the God when you are at a loss. Did you change your religious beliefs?"
...And he offers an absurd welcome.

"Shut up. I don't have time for your sarcasm. If you want to make small talk, do it alone."
"Oh. ...I see, you seem disturbed. I'm surprised you made it here in your condition. Why don't we go to the back if it's going to be a long conversation? It must be hard for you to stay on your feet."

"I'm fine. Just answer me, Kotomine.
 You knew that Sakura is a Holy Grail, right?"

"Of course. I opened her body, after all. I knew that she is a black Holy Grail that Matou Zouken coordinated."
The priest plainly answers, as if it's not a big deal.

"Do you know what that means...!?"
My head boils up in an instant.
I tried to be calm, but Kotomine's reply shatters my composure.

"Yes. I knew better than you what that meant.
 If we let Matou Sakura live, she would end up killing many people. That is why I warned you. I asked you if she was worth keeping alive."


I stop.
...He's right.
Kotomine did warn me back then.
He saved her, but he kept repeating that keeping her alive was a mistake.

"Then... then why did you save Sakura?
 I only wanted to protect her. But you don't have a reason to."

"I do have a reason. Like you, I did not want to let Matou Sakura die. I could not leave the new life within her to die.
 Humans die. Sakura's death would be only natural. Were she the only one to die, I would never have gone to such lengths."

"If Sakura were the only one to die?"
In short...
He's saying he saved Sakura to save that black shadow...!?

"That is exactly right, Emiya Shirou. It is the law of nature for people to die from wounds.  But you cannot kill what has not yet come into existence.
 You protected Matou Sakura to save her.
 I saved Matou Sakura to protect the darkness that she conceived.
 That is my motive. We had different goals, but we both needed the girl to live. Are you dissatisfied with the result?"


I'm not dissatisfied.
No matter what his intentions were, I had no choice but to ask for his help back then.
Andhe sacrificed his entire Magic Crest to save Sakura.
I should at least thank him for the result.

"...You're right. I'm not interested in what your motives are.
 But let me ask you. If you're saying that, you must know what that thing is."

"You must mean the shadow threatening the town.
 ...Well, I have an idea, but what about you?
 What do you think it is?"
"...Zouken said it's the contents of the Holy Grail. He said that what's inside the Holy Grail is coming out through Sakura."

"You asked him yourself, eh? ...I see, that is certainly something he might think of.
 So, do you believe everything he said? Do you believe the shadow is the contents of the Holy Grail appearing through Matou Sakura, and that it will continue to kill people as long as she is alive?"

"I won't trust Zouken. ...But his explanation matches the facts. I have to admit that Sakura and that shadow are related."

"Yes. Zouken's explanation contains no lie, but he is not telling the whole truth either.
 The power in the Holy Grail is colorless.
 It is colorless, so it will never attack people on its own. Power without direction only disperses."

"Oh."
...What he's saying makes sense.
First of all, why is something that's leaked out of the gate indiscriminately attacking people?

"What's going on? Why is it attacking people?"
"I do not even need to mention why. There exists 'something that kills people' inside the Holy Grail. That is the only possible explanation."
"Wha"
Something that kills people?
That thing is inside the Holy Grail and ruining Sakura?


...My vision wavers.
This is too ridiculous to be true...

But didn't I...

...Look up at such a thing ten years ago?

"! That makes even less sense...!
 If the Holy Grail's power is colorless, something that has a purpose like killing people shouldn't exist in it!"

"Correct. It is something that should not exist. It is a contradiction that should never have been created.
 But it is definitely there, within the Holy Grail.
 Ten years ago. I already told you how Kiritsugu and I fought for the Holy Grail.
 Its contents were already tainted at that time. The power that should have been colorless was instead a swirl that interpreted everything as slaughter."

"But it is a big enough swirl of magical energy to grant wishes.
 That function has not been lost.
 The only problem is that its idea of 'happiness' is to use the evil to expose the good.
 That is why it brought on that tragic fire ten years ago.
 I still found the Holy Grail worthy, but Kiritsugu destroyed it, unable to accept its evil."

"I need not remind you of the result. My Servant was showered with its tainted contents, and the mud that leaked from the Holy Grail burned the town and caused many deaths.
 You should remember the scene."

...Yeah, I did see it.
I saw the cause of it...!

"Then that black hole is..."
"Yes, it is a gate called the Holy Grail.
 How ironic. The cup that receives the purest souls.
 That pure object was completely tainted when a small amount of poison was mixed into it. It is colorless, after all. No matter how deep and magnificent the Holy Grail may have been, it was powerless against a colored foreign substance."

"Foreign substance...? That's what caused the content of the Holy Grail to change colors...?"

"Most likely. The Einzberns summoned something they should not have on the third ritual. As a result, an impurity was introduced into the Holy Grail War, the ritual they had prepared.
 Sixty years passed between the third and fourth wars, yet the impurity that had waited so long for its birth still could not emerge into the outside world."

"The fourth Holy Grail was too narrow.
 The war reached its deadline with Archer and Saber still remaining, and the Holy Grail was not complete. The gate did open, but Kiritsugu instantly destroyed it."

"Impuritythen that guy's the main body of the black shadow...?"
"'That guy' is hardly the proper term.
 Even if the contents of the Holy Grail are tainted, it is still only a swirl of raw power. What's inside is magical energy with a direction.
 It is a cursed swirl that is specialized and directed at killing people. It is a pure evil that is the embodiment of human evil."

"That is the phenomenon inside the Holy Grailthe main body of the shadow roaming the town at night. Well, it is still only an expected baby that cannot even produce the shadow without Matou Sakura."

"Expected baby...? Don't be ridiculous! Are you saying Sakura has to give birth to something mysterious like that...!?"
"No. It will appear from her body if she is a legitimately made Holy Grail.
 But she is special.
 That thing is trying to consume her and become the gate itself."

"Its birth. It is trying to come into this world by transferring its power to her.
 It is power without a body. It has no need for a human form. It can exist in this world if someone inherits its power."

"The content of the Holy Grail is not leaking out.
 It is an evil that is trying to bring itself into the world by permeating Matou Sakura.
 Thereforethe black shadow is not the contents of the Holy Grail.
 It is already Matou Sakura herself.
 It is permeating into the master, and once the power is completely succeeded, she will turn into the shadow."


...Hold on.
...Hold on a minute, Kotomine.
Even if you say that, I can't think straight.

"It was an incomplete Holy Grail from the start.
 ...No, she had already made the contract when the tainted Holy Grail from the last war was used.
 It would not have ended this way if the Einzbern's Holy Grail were used. It would have been filled with curses, but they would not be compatible."


Shut up.
First of all, your talks are too long.
You should keep things simple.
Like how that shadow isn't Sakura's subconscious.
That's what Zouken said, but the shadow is attacking people because that's its nature.
Sakura...
It's not something she wished for.

"The curse swirling within the Holy Grail. The curse would not have been able to take form unless the Holy Grail was compatible with it.
 Instead, it connected with something that could give it shape.
 It would not have taken a definite form if it were a normal Holy Grail, such as Einzbern's gold or a bronze using a body of a magus. It is a curse that has mass, after all. In some cases, it might turn into an expanding lump of flesh."


I said I don't care about things that don't concern us.
Get to the point.
Let me know the conclusion.
I thought I could save Sakura if I defeated the shadow.
I thought I could save her if I could defeat it before Sakura completely turned into the Holy Grail.
Butif that shadow is Sakura herself...

"The curse obtained a host named Matou Sakura.
 She is a human who was raised to be a Magic Circuit, embedded with 'the sense of touch' that leaked out during the previous war. The more she opens the gate as the Holy Grail, the more she will combine with what is inside.
 But do not worry.
 So long as she retains her sanity, the shadow will remain a shadow.
 No matter how much the curse may contaminate her, she still has command. As long as she tries to close the gate as a Holy Grail, the content will stay in her and not be able to escape outside."

"It is the same as the relationship between a Servant and his Master.
 The Servant, the curse, cannot use its power unless its Master, Matou Sakura, allows it. One cannot overturn this relationship, no matter how strong one may be.
 Matou Sakura's sanity obstructs the curse's desire to kill people."

"Matou Sakura can accept the curse as a part of her, or her sanity can cave in to the magical energy of the curse. The darkness in her will be given birth the instant either occurs.
 She is the shadow already. Even if the war were over, you could never return her to her original form."


That means...
When I defeat that black shadow and see its corpse...
Sakura's body will come out from beneath its darkness

"Haa    , ah."
I thought my heart stopped.
I clutch my chest and force myself to breathe.

"Then letting Sakura live means..."
"Letting that black shadow emerge. Her mind will eventually die, and hell will take form.
 Well, I did not think her body could endure it, but you have done well, Emiya Shirou. She is still functioning as the Holy Grail, thanks to you."
"!"

"Do you want to turn Sakura into a monster...!?"

"Of course. No matter what it may be, we cannot stop it as long as it has the will to be born.
 And do not misunderstand, Emiya Shirou.
 You call it a monster when it has not even come into this world?"

"Of course...! That shadow is a devil. It's a devil that's killing people without limit...!"
"You are rushing to conclusions. Good and evil are what we decide on after it occurs. Nobody can deny what has yet to exist.
 Or what? Are you saying the son of a criminal will definitely be a criminal? So we should kill him before he is born?"

"Wha"
How ridiculous.
That thing is a killer by its very nature.
And in reality, it is killing people!

"That is your mistake. That shadow has only been created from the host, Matou Sakura. What is about to be born from the Holy Grail is something different.
 That shadow is merely using Matou Sakura to suck lives needed for its birth. It is the same as a baby that wants to live.
 You cannot judge it to be good or evil, as it is doing so unconsciously."

"Don't be stupid! People are dying!"
"True. It shall receive punishment for its crime. But that is after it is born. Nobody can deny its existence right now.
 You cannot reject that which has not yet been born and cannot be punished."

"Look. A clear evil does not exist in this world.
 Butif there is an evil in this world...
 Would it not be the act of denying what is about to be born?"


I swallow my words.
It's not that I agree with Kotomine that Sakura should become the contents of the Holy Grail.
But condemning him won't change anything, let alone save Sakura.

"Kotomine. Is your intention to have Sakura turn into the Holy Grail?"
I ask with hostility.
It's a question to clarify our positions, a statement made too late to be a declaration of hostility.

"I said that is why I saved her. I will bless whatever is born.
 Just as you protect Matou Sakura, I will protect the embryo."
"I see. Does that mean you're our enemy?"

"Of course. But it's not that I want Matou Sakura's life, or that I want the Holy Grail's power like Matou Zouken.
 I will only protect what lies within the Holy Grail after it has been born. If the mother, Matou Sakura, should reject the child before it is born, I will respect her decision."

...There's no lie in his words.
This priest does not care who wins the Holy Grail War.

All he wants is the result.
He just wants to see what appears after Zouken or I remain.
He has no intention of forcing Sakura and altering her.
He is saying he will save Sakura only when we're unable to save her and when she turns into something else.

"...All right. I won't do anything to you as long as you're just watching. No matter your intentions, you saved Sakura's life.
 ...That's all I care about right now."

"I see. All I did was save the body of the mother, but I will not say anything if that is what you think.
 Well, is that all? Then go back to Matou Sakura. This is no time for her to be left alone."

"........."
The priest is worrying about Sakura's healthno, her mind.
We're clearly enemies, yet I still can't tell for certain.

"No. I want to ask one more thing.
 ...This will probably be my last question."
"Oh. If that is the case, I cannot refuse. All right, I shall listen."
"Kotomine. Can Sakura be saved?"

...The atmosphere changes.
The pressure from the priest increases as he gives me advice.

"There is a way. But the success rate is about fifty-fifty.
 The person called Matou Sakura will disappear once she is complete as a Holy Grail. But if her mind can endure the power from the Holy Grail for a bit, that small amount of time will be your hope."

"A few seconds at most.
 You will need to control the Holy Grail and use its power to eliminate what is within her.
 In short, you're using brute force. You just need to use the Holy Grail to kill the baby within her and the crest worm that is transforming her.
 The Holy Grail is tainted, but it still has the power to grant wishes. If it is used to kill, it can kill any form of life."

"So it all comes down to the Holy Grail, huh? From the start, this war is..."
"Yes, it all comes down to obtaining the Holy Grail.
 But watch out. You are directing the power of the Holy Grail at itself.
 A normal magus would not be able to control the magical energy, and it could end up repeating the disaster that occurred ten years ago.
 Not only that. It is madness to try to take control of the Holy Grail in only a few seconds. It's a miracle you will never achieve by yourself."

"Heh, but that's the only way, right? Then I'll do it. And if that's the case, I do have one hope."

"I see, you have Rin.
 Rin is Matou Sakura's older sister. It should be possible to tune with her sister's mind and moderate the reaction from the Holy Grail.
 But I do not think Rin would go with such a ridiculous gamble."


...That's true.
I'll have to convince her to change our course of action once I get home.

"It's fine, that's my problem.
 Well, bye. I hate to say it, but thanks. I don't approve of your opinion, but I'll thank you."
"Hold on. I answered your question, so I have something to ask of you as well."


I stop.
...I don't want to, but it's nothing if I can return the favor.

"What? You're the one that said this is it. Make it short."
"Well. Let's say by some chance, you do save Matou Sakura with this method.
 But are you fine with that, Emiya Shirou? Even if Matou Sakura is not a Holy Grail anymore, it will not change the fact that she ate humans. Are you going to protect such a sinner?"


It stops.
My heart freezes.

"You are not the only one who cannot bear it.
 Matou Sakura has killed many. I do not think she will be able to forgive herself."
"That's"
"It must be painful to commit a crime and live on, knowing you cannot atone for it. Then is it not better to just kill her?
 It is less painful that way, and it will be an apology to all who she has killed."


...That's right.
The chain would end right there.
It doesn't matter if she intended to or not.
No matter the reason, the assailant must be punished.
If she took lives, she must repay the victims with something of equal value.

So kill.
My morals tell me I must kill Sakura if I truly pity the victims.

Not only that.
If I can't save Sakura and she becomes a Holy Grail, nothing can stop her.
Many more lives will be lost.
Just like that day.
Innocent people will die without knowing the meaning of their death.

I swallow the gastric juice coming up my throat.
My eyes become bloodshot.
I might bleed out of my eyes.
I slash the pressre with thousands of swords and...
"Right. But that won't be atonement."
...I confess that I'll still protect Sakura.

"I see. So that means you will not follow Kiritsugu's path."
He talks as if he's disinterested.
The priest regards me with a bored expression, as if disappointed.

"Father's path...?"
"That's right. Your father loved humans.
 Higher, wider, farther. He loved humans as they go over their limits without end. That is why he turned himself into the definite evil.
 That man would have killed Matou Sakura. He threw away his human emotions for the sake of justice."

"...Is that any different from you?
 Casting away one person's happiness for the sake of justice, for many people's happiness."
"No. What you people call happiness did not bring me joy."

"Huh...?"
That's not a reply.
No, more than that...
He's not even looking at me.

"Right, we were different.
 He threw away what he had, but I had nothing to throw away.
 The result was the same, but the process was completely different.
 His existence was too unpleasant. His agony was truly unpleasant.
 If he went to such lengths to cast it away, he should never have had it in the first place. But still he agonized over his decision, trying to pick it back up after he threw it away. As if saying that is the correct way for humans to live."

"The difference was crucial. Yes. If I cannot obtain anything, why was I born into this world?"

The priest's words are not directed at anyone.
...But they contain anger.
They contain emotion, which I thought this man did not have.

"...Hah. Come to think of it, there is no way you can succeed Kiritsugu. He did what was necessary by throwing things away, but you insist on having it both ways.
 We are similar, you and I.
 You died once and broke down when you were resurrected. It is posteriori, but you are like me, a defect from birth."
"What...? What part of me is broken?"

"You just do not realize it.
 You have no concept of self. So I did not think you would concern yourself with a single person. No, rather"
You are not concerned about many, but concerned about all as if they were only one.
Yes.
Kotomine Kirei sounds almost envious as he speaks to himself.

"Anyway. I will not stop you if you plan to save Matou Sakura in spite of everything. Be burdened with as much sin as you want.
 But let me warn you.
 If you want to save Matou Sakura in any way, you will need to kill Matou Zouken. He will take over her body after her mind disappears. You will not be able to save her after that."

"You mean Zouken will take over Sakura?"
"Yes. His main body is a parasite. I do not know where the worm with his soul exists, but it is easy for him to take over another's body as long as it is alive.
 He is immortal, in a way. You cannot completely eliminate him unless you find that tiny main body or purify his soul itself."

"I see. That's actually a relief. I have to defeat Zouken either way."
"Hah. I see, it is certainly easy to understand.
 Defeat Matou Zouken and make Matou Sakura the winner. Control the Holy Grail that appears and purify Matou Sakura's body. So that is your course of action."

I don't want to, but I nod.
The plan should be simple, like Kotomine said.

"This is just my personal opinion, but Matou Sakura's mind is surprisingly strong and too well-suited to the curse in the Holy Grail.
 If Rin is the positive, she is the negative. If Matou Zouken made a mistake, it is right there. That black shadow has developed Matou Sakura over his expectations. That must be why he contacted you."

"Protect Matou Sakura.
 If she can survive the emergence, she should not die."
I don't say anything, but nod back.
Kotomine wants Sakura to change.
But he's still much better than Zouken.

"You won't get to take any part in this. I won't let such a mysterious thing be born."
"That is the spirit. Whatever happens, do not let Zouken have her."
With a snort, I turn my back to him.

I have no business here.
I have to quickly go back to Sakura.
"Come here, you bitch...!"
"Kya...!"

He pushes her down.
Attacked from behind and still unable to move her limbs, the girl easily falls to the bed.

"You traitor! You're home late!"
He gets on top of her as he screams.
He scowls at the girl he pulled to this room, running his fingers across the skin he hasn't touched in a while.
"!"
The girl's chin jumps.
The fingers, violating her as they crawl from her neck to her breasts, are a sign of the start.

Yes, the sequence is always the same.
This man is the absolute master.
The girl loses her will, opens up her body, and exposes her shame when he orders her.
The only resistance came during the first time.
The secret affairs after that were the same.
The girl made no attempt to fight back, never showing even a sign of emotion.
She was violated, attended to his needs, and drowned in lewdness like she was told to.

The reaction is the start of a regular routine.
Even if she shows no emotion, her body cannot suppress the pleasure.
Her lustful body reacts happily as it accepts men.

"Hahyeah, that's what I expect from you!
 That's right, you don't change, no matter how quiet you pretend to be.
 You're a Matou woman. You're a vulgar failure of a magus, a whore that wants men's sperm!"
The man roughly pushes down the girl's body.
"Hm...! No"
A spasm runs through her.
The man smiles, believing the reaction is the same as always.

It's no different.
Their relationship will never change, no matter where the woman may run.
Even if she regains her emotion or finds another man, she will want him once he pushes her down.
This woman is his possession.
It doesn't matter if she is the heir. She is merely a toy given to him.

That's why he doesn't notice until it happens.
The girl struggling beneath him feels no excitement.
He doesn't notice that she's filled with nothing but disgust and loathing.

"Oh, you sure are energetic today. I see, so Emiya wasn't able to satisfy you. I see, I see, that's great!
 I bet Emiya is depressed now!
 The girl he fell in love with was a real sex maniac!"
Does that knowledge please him more than the act of violating her?
The man laughs from the bottom of his heart and reaches out for her clothes.
He'll do the usual.
He will not undress her.
He always exposes her body.
He rips the clothes off her, as if tearing her apart.

"Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's have a wild fuck."
A crack opens in the girl's chest.
At that instant...
"Nostop!  Don't come near me, Nii-san...!"
The girl refuses the man with all her might.

"Huh?"
The man stops.
He lets go of her breasts, then looks down at the girl as one might look at a mysterious thing.

"What did you say? What did you just say?"
A voice of surprise.
The girl gulps, but stares resolutely back at him.

"I-I said please don't come near me. I won't obey you anymore.
 ...Senpai accepted a girl like me. He said he'll protect me...! I'm not yours, Nii-san! I'm Senpai's now...!"

The girl frantically tries to push the man off of her.
But the man will not even budge.
It's only natural. Her strength cannot push a man back, least of all when he has her in a mounted position.
"Wha"
A hollow voice.
The man looks down at the girl on the bed.

"Shut up. Shut up, shut up, shut up, you whore!"
And he starts punching his sister in a rage.

"Emiya's...!? You won't do as I tell you...!?
 Don't get it wrong, you don't have such a right! I'm the one to decide! You just have to nod back like always...!"
He does not hold back.
The man has no sanity left, having been denied by his possession, something that should never betray him.

"Take it back, Sakura! You're mine. You're nobody else's...! Know your place! You were sold to Matou...! So you have no right to disobey me...!"
He punches her as though he has gone mad.
;  "          "
The girl does not fight back.
She doesn't even protect her face from the punches.
Her eyes show great determination, condemning the man on top of her.

"......!"
That is the last straw.
He can't stand the look in her eyes.
He doesn't want her staring straight at him.

So...
"I see. Then I have a plan too. Do what you want if you like Emiya so much.
 ...But Sakura. You shouldn't hide things from someone you love, right?"
He decides to reveal everything the girl fears the most.

"Nii-san."
Her eyes open wide.
"Hah."
He laughs.
The expression of despair pleases him a bit.

"That's right, Sakura. I'll tell Emiya all about it. He accepted you, right? Then this is nothing at all."
"N"
She can't form the words.
The girl stares in astonishment.
She looks up at her older brother with empty eyes, just like before.

"Hah. Haha, ahahahahahahaha!
 That's right, that's all you can manage! Just be obedient if you don't want that. You're my toy. Don't disobey me no matter what...!"
The laughter fills the room.
But for the girl, it only sounds like annoying howling.

"y?"
Why?
The girl asks, her mind empty.

She doesn't want her SenpaiShirou to find out about her secret.
The relationship with her brother, her task to supervise the Emiya household, and her eleven years of life in the basement.
Her Senpai knows.
He already knows.
The only thing he doesn't know about is her relationship with her brother. But he should not hate her, even after finding out about it.
Shirou will probably forgive her.

"Oh."
Right.
Just like last night, he will destroy something in order to accept her.
But that's why she cannot bear it.
She doesn't want to take anything more away from him. She would rather keep things like this.
She can let her brother rape her, like she always does.

"N"
But she can't.
...She was able to bear it until now.
But now her body belongs to Shirou... and the thought of giving that body to her brother disgusts her.

"o."
She cannot accept either.
She doesn't want to be violated by her brother, and she doesn't want him to tell Shirou about their secret.

All that's left is her naked emotion.
The mind that has been suppressed for eleven years...

The man grabs her breasts.
Her brother tries to expose her body as if it's natural to do so.
"NoNo, no, no, no...! Stop, I don't want this, please stop, Nii-san...!"
She resists with all her might.
He laughs at her futile efforts.

"Hah, what are you saying? You want it, right? You don't care as long as it's a man. Oh, that's why I have to tell Emiya about it. About how bad you clung onto me and how dirtily we fucked...!"
He laughs.
He laughs.
Her brother laughs.


And she realizes.
He will tell him.
No matter what happens, no matter what she does, he will tell her Senpai about it.
...No matter what.
He intends to ruin her for his own amusement.

"Why?"
She murmurs.
Why does it always end up like this?
She endured so many things so he wouldn't find out about it.
She lied, lied to others, lied to herself, and kept telling herself that she could be happy.
She thought she was happy just by being at her Senpai's house.

But...
Why isn't he protecting such a small thing?

...No, he's not the only one who isn't protecting her.
She thought for a long time.
She has cursed for a long time.
Why.
Whythe world around her hates her so much


The strength floods out of her body.
She loses her will to resist, and her brother looks down at her in satisfaction.

"HaHaha, hahahahahahahahahaha!
 Come on, spread your legs like you always do, bitch...!
 You wouldn't even care if a dog fucked you, right!? All you can do is accept a man...!"
Asserting his dominance, he starts to violate her like he always does.
The girl stares up him with empty eyes.
"I wish he wouldn't exist."
Eleven years.
She thinks something she has never thought during that time.


The air makes a sound.
The man on top of her falls down.
Fresh blood splatters onto her.
The girl raises her body and looks at her silent brother.

"Oh."
It was an instant death.
He must have been hit with a very sharp string.
A line is visible on the back of his head, as if it was drawn in with a pencil.
The line reaches his brain, but the line is too thin to make his brain spill out, and his blood is the only thing flowing out.

"Oh."
She looks down at it without emotion.
The shadow that killed her brother wavers.
It wavers in the gray sunlight.
Her own shadow...
Her own shadow is standing up and wavering.

"Ah."
So she's the one that killed.
It was she who killed her brother.
She understands, but does not feel anything.
She feels nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
No disgust, no fear, no guilt, no regret.
The only thought in her vacant mind is that it was easy.

"Ah, ah."
She's used to it.
This isn't her first time.
Because she saw plenty in her dreams.
She saw it in her dreamso did she copy what she saw?

"Ah, ha."
She doesn't know.
But she thinks she should've done it sooner.
If she'd known she wouldn't feel anything, she would've done it a long time ago.
She thinks, and...
"FuFufu."
...Her empty emotion murmurs that it was fun.

It was fun.
It was fun.
It was fun...?
It was fun...?

Where?
When?
What?

Dream.
Dream.
That's right. She wasn't dreaming.
Those dreams were

Not dreams.
The one that wandered through the night and killed the men was herself.
Yes, she killed many people.
She killed many, many people.
KILLED those that ran away KILLED without leaving a drop KILLED everyone KILLED with pleasure KILLED laughing KILLED laughing KILLED laughing...!!

"Aha. Ahaha. Ahahaha."
It's so funny, she laughs.
Because she'll break down unless she laughs.
She can't bear it unless she's laughing.
But more tears flow out the more she laughs, and everything becomes meaningless for her.

"Haha! Ahaha, hahahahahahahaha!"
It's so funny that her stomach hurts.
It's as if she's regressing mentally every time she laughs.
But it's so comforting and natural.
Oh, how stupid, how stupid, how foolish...!

"FuFufu, ah."
Her face is contorted in a manic grin.
In place of her silent brother, the girl sweetly spills out a voice like glass.

...And like that.
After tinkering with her brother's body like she's playing house, she gets up.
She stands in front of the mirror, still covered in blood.
Behind her stands the shadow that killed so many.

Her own shadow.
The black shadow that has eaten countless people.
Someone was there, trying hard not to turn her into it.
Someone was there by her side.
She laughs.
There was never any hope for her.

"I see. I was slowly going crazy."
She twirls in front of the mirror.
The girl makes a proud smile.
"Look, Senpai. I was crazy from the beginning."
And speaks as if asking for a dance.

The girl's consciousness ends there.
No, to be more accurate, it changes.
It's merely that her repressed subconscious has risen to the surface.

Something talks to the girl.
Behind her.
The darkness stays as darkness, shows up as a presence, and looks at the girl.

"You have killed many people, Sakura."
The girl doesn't reply.
She doesn't even need to acknowledge such a question.

"You cannot live as a human anymore."
The girl doesn't reply.
She doesn't even need to be told about it.

"Accept the shadow. Nobody can stop you. Seize the daughter of Einzbern and obtain the Holy Grail. That is the only way for you to live."
"Yes. As you wish, Grandfather."
She nods quietly.
Did she agree because it sounds fun?
Or did she just want to run away?
The girl doesn't understand her own mind anymore.

But the pain in her body goes away as soon as she accepts it.
...It crawls up.
Black mud comes out from her core and smears itself on her skin.
The pain turns into fire to burn her skin.
Like a curse...
It turns her white skin into something else.

"Oh. With this, I..."
...Won't lose to anyone.
Nobody will get in the way.
She knows that she is the strongest one now.
The absolute certainty is similar to a sexual uplifting.
In her mind, the girl defeats everyone who has threatened her.
She pierces their legs as they run, rips off their arms as they fight back, stitches shut their mouths as they beg for mercy, chews on their eyes as they cry from pain, and finally gouges out their heart, laughing.

"Hm"
Her body trembles.
Just imagining it brings her close to orgasm.
...And in this fantasy...
Foremost in her mind is the relative she loves the most, the one called Tohsaka Rin.
"Damn, what's going on...!?"
It's obvious that something's going on in the yard.
A damp magical energy that makes me want to vomit is swirling so much that I can almost touch it.
I would feel the abnormality even if I weren't a magus.

"Wha"
I was prepared for it, but I get dizzy the instant I see it.
Tohsaka is covered by a shadow like coal tar.
Ilya is standing at the side of the yard, and Black Saber is standing in front of her.
And in the middle of the yard is Sakura, pointing her hand at Tohsaka

"Sakura!!!!"
I jump into the yard.
I have to help them both, but Tohsaka is in the most danger right now.
Covered in coal tar, Tohsaka looks pale, and it looks like her life is in danger.

"Tohsaka...! Hey, pull yourself together, you idiot...!"

There's no reply.
"Hold on, I'll have this off you in a minute...!"

I tear away the mud that's covering her.
The mud is gelatinous, but it's just like rubber.
I can't grab it, and even if I pull it off of her body, it just bounces back onto her.

"......! What is this!? I can touch her, so why...!?"
I can't get the mud off, no matter what.
I panic and frantically try to free her.

There...
"It's useless, Senpai. I'm the only one who can dispel my shadow. Someone as weak as you will be swallowed instead."
"Sakura?"
Sakura speaks in a cold voice I've never heard from her.

"Sakurayour face..."
My rage turns to ice.

...Sakura's neck.
Something that looks like a tattoo is consuming her.
It doesn't look like it, but it's a Command Spell.
A mysterious Command Spell is crawling over Sakura's body

"...I'm surprised. You came here in a hurry, Senpai.
 But you're confused. You saw what happened to Nii-san, but you're not scolding me."
"That's... fine. We don't have to talk about Shinji right now. I'll listen once you've calmed down."

...That's right.
I have to talk with Sakura right now.
Zouken said a lot of crazy things, but they're all lies.
Sakura is still Sakura.
She's talking to me like always and

"No. I don't want to talk about it, and I don't want to talk with you, Senpai. I'm the only one that gets to talk here.
 No one can scold me now, be it Senpai, Nee-san, Nii-san, or anyone in town."

"!"
A chill runs down my back.
No, this isn't just a chill.
It's an intensely cold thorn, as if a knife were slashed from my brain down to my waist.

"Senpai. Why are you protecting Nee-san?"

My vision whites out for a second.
A shadow is standing behind Sakura.

"Ah"
The chill runs throughout my body, paralyzing me with fear.
That's Sakura.
Even when I heard that the shadow is Sakura, I could bear it.
But now that I've seen it, I know.

...My left arm melted when it merely touched it.
The thing that went around town killing people like a machineis Sakura.

"Sa... kura."
My throat goes dry.
My eyeballs convulse.
My vision wavers as if space itself is twisted.
Every cell in me screams a warning, trying to defrost my frozen body.

But it doesn't melt.
Sakura's presence isn't human, but something different.
It's not her vast magical energy that got to me.
There's only one reason why my body's frozen.
Sakura is being hostile towards me.

"Yes. You were always like that. You said you'd protect me, but then you'd watch over everyone but me.
 But it's fine. I wanted you because you're that kind of a person."

My vision distorts.
The words from the Sakura I don't know cause my mind to break apart.
It tells me it's not her.
She's not Sakura.
Something I shouldn't think about fills my brain.

"My presence here is painful for you, right, Senpai?
 I know how much of a burden I am to you. You'll continue to suffer as long you're with me.
 So I had to get away from you."

The shadow dances around.
The ground is like a stage for a shadow picture.

"But I can't. You're the only happiness I have.
 And you can't get away from me. Because you can't betray yourself anymore."

"......Yes. That's why I'll kill you. Then you'll be with me forever, and most of all
 You won't have to suffer anymore, right?"

The shadow stretches.
It surges forth like a wave, trying to swallow me along with Tohsaka.

I react by instinct, pushing Tohsaka away.
The black tide sweeps over me.
I don't even think about avoiding it myself.

I was frightened.
I thought Sakura wasn't Sakura for an instant.
That knowledge wouldn't let me move my body.

I know this.
This is the darkness I was showered with before.
I'll go insane. I couldn't even bear it for a second back then.
My mind will disappear before my body if it falls directly on me.

"Guhah."

My body shrivels.
My warmth fades away.
It's more painful and frightening than I thought, so my body struggles to break free.
But I can't jump.
First of all, there's no ground to kick off of.
I will...

"Aheh?"
I realize that I'm back in the yard.
My vision is filled with purple hair.

"...Rider, you..."
"This is your order, Sakura. You told me to protect Emiya Shirou no matter the circumstances."

"Rider."
It's Rider that saved me from the black wave.
"Please do not move. You will faint if you try to stand up in your state."

...No, I can't even stand up.
I'm on my knees, and just breathing is enough effort to render me unconscious.

".........I see. You're going to oppose me, Rider?
 Then I'll take you in as well. I don't need any more Servants since I've absorbed something that wasn't in the plan

 But I'll specially make you just like Saber."

...The shadow stands up.
...Maybe she's serious because Rider is opposing her. The shadow coming from Sakura covers the whole yard.

...The whole place is dyed black.
Rider doesn't show signs of running away, but stares at the creeping shadow like a criminal awaiting execution.

"That's enough. You shouldn't do anything unnecessary, Sakura.
 You can't come back if you take any more in."

"Ilya."
The shadow stops its advance.

"...What does that mean, Ilyasviel?"
"I mean exactly what I said. Even if you absorb Rider, kill Shirou, or disable Rin, it'll be meaningless. You're wasting your time, so why don't you stop throwing a tantrum?"

...What's she up to?
Ilya walks over to Sakura.


"I'm the one you want, right? Then let's just finish this. I'll go with you, so leave them alone."

"Are you serious? I only want your heart.
 Coming with me means you don't mind getting killed."
"I know. But I'm going to be killed either way, and resistance is useless. You're the strongest one for now."

Ilya talks without emotion.

...It pisses me off.
In my condition, I can't figure out what Ilya's trying to say.

"Are you saying you'll sacrifice yourself, Ilyasviel?"
"Yes. That's my role.
 But the formal dress isn't here. If you want to open the gate as the successor, we have to go to my castle to get it."


"And you intended to settle things, right?
 Then there's no need to kill Shirou.
 You accepted it because you didn't want to kill anyone, but now you do want to kill them? You're contradicting yourself, Sakura."
"!"

...The shadow retreats.
Not only the shadow in the yard, but the mud on Tohsaka fades away as though it never existed.

"......All right. It'll save me the trouble of finding it myself.
 I don't know what you're trying to do, but I'll fall for your smooth talk."
Her long hair flutters.
Sakura turns her defenseless back to us and leaves, as if she lost interest in us.

"Sakura......!"
I scream for her to stop.
"............"

"...Please never show yourself again.
 Should you stand in my way againI'll have to kill you."

Sakura leaves.
I can't follow after her, or even call out.

"Sakura's right. Your role's already over.
 Dealing with the aftermath is my duty. I'll take Sakura, so you can rest now, Shirou."

I can't save Ilya either, 
"Goodbye. It was fun, Onii-chan."

and I hear a sad farewell.


Everything melts away with that.
My body stops trembling against the shadow.
My guilt over thinking that Sakura was someone else disappears.

I'm pissed.
I was trembling miserably, unable even to take Sakura's hand.
Not only that.
I made Ilya, the one who called me Onii-chan, make a face like that!

"Idiot!"
I run.
My whole body feels like lead and my brain churns with cold nausea, but I follow after them.

"Do not pursue them. I will kill you if you take another step."
"......!"
A black servant blocks my way.
She points her sword at me, overwhelming us without saying a word.

"...Please get out of my way, Saber. I can't let those two leave like that."
"That is my line. I cannot let you follow after them. ...And even if I do withdraw, what can you do?"


"...This is your final warning. Sakura will obtain the Holy Grail one way or another. That is the only way for her to be released.
 Even if the result is her death, Matou Sakura will be saved."

"If you wish to save her, then withdraw.
 Should you follow us in spite of thatI will take your head."

...Black Saber disappears.
Sakura and Ilya are gone.
They've vanished, as if they've faded into the shadow.

"Da"
The spirit that kept me going until now dissipates.
My body drops to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut.
"mn."

...I can't stay conscious.
As my vision fades...
The image of Sakura drowning in the shadow sticks in my mind, as if to impeach me.

Let's make the final decision.

The outcome of the battle is decided.
Or more accurately, it was decided a long time ago.
This end has been determined ever since you lost Saber.

'...But Shirou. To oppose that thing is to go down the most difficult path.
 Please keep that in mind.'

That was said by the girl who fought with you as your sword until the very end.
The night you parted with her.
You promised to keep fighting by yourself, stop the shadow, and end the war.

There was hell.
There has to be a meaning to why you survived that hell.
There has to be a meaning to why you must keep living.
It's not that you miraculously survived while everyone else died.
It's merely that one person was saved by the sacrifice of everyone else.

You hated that.
To break through reality, all you could do was become a superhero that can save anyone.

I don't know what those tears were.
He destroyed the Holy Grail, denied his battle because it was wrong, and frantically searched for any survivors.
No matter what his intentions were, his tears saved you, and you were able to start walking on a new path with him.

But you were left alone on the path.
The man who led the way died, leaving the dream to you.
'YeahI'm relieved.'

Emiya Kiritsugu swallowed the sins for which he couldn't atone and left this world.

He couldn't save anyone.
So he wanted you to be able to save someone.

'If you are to deny everything you've done.
 The crime will judge you'

...I know.
I know what it means, and I have to atone for it using all my life.
I killed the me that I believed in for ten years.
The me that was killed will feed on me.

And this is the embodiment of that crime.
A saint's shield is useless.
Archer's arm will eat away at me, forcing me to atone for my sins.
It will bring an end far worse than death.

That's right.
It's only one arm. Now that you survived, you won't die even if you cut it off.
So why?

'You know it too, right? You can't choose all, and you can only save one.'

A girl that longed for her father, but lived seeking revenge.
She almost cried, but smiled and swallowed her words so that we could live together.
Saying we can't do such a thing.
We can't live long together.
So...

'Goodbye. It was fun, Onii-chan.'

     .

This is the final decision.
You
"Of course...!
 What about the match is decided!? I can't back out now...!!!!"

"That's the spirit. It seems there is no need for hospitalization."
"EhKotomine...?"

"...That is my line.
 You and Rin were abandoned at the door.
 I wanted to leave you two, since you made a rather ugly pair as abandoned children go, but you were also dead on your feet. Had I done nothing, there would have been two dead bodies in front of my church. A church cannot afford that image, so I had no choice but to treat you."


...I figure out the situation I'm in.
This is the chapel.
There's nothing wrong with my body. The energy that was swallowed by Sakura's shadow has recovered.
I lost consciousness back in my yard. It must be the same for Tohsaka.
Rider probably carried us here.

Rider has no means of healing wounded people.
Kotomine was probably the only one she knew that could heal us.
How long has it been?
The time is

"It is three in the morning. You have been sleeping for about twelve hours since you were carried here."
"Twelve hours!? That's half a day...!"
I get up from the chair I was lying on.
I can't lie around like this...!

"Kotomine, where's Tohsaka!? She was there too, right!? Where is she!?"

"I have Rin resting at her place.
 You only had your energy taken away, but she had her magical energy taken away. It would normally take seven days to recover, but the land of Tohsaka is good for her.
 If all goes well, she should regain consciousness by tomorrow afternoon."

"I see. So her life's not in danger?"
"No. The soil of that land is special. It is a ley line that is said to have been home to vampires. Rin is her family's heir, so she will be back to her impudent self if I keep her buried for a day."

"......"
I think I heard something I'm not used to hearing, but I decide not to ask about it.
Let's hope he doesn't literally mean "bury".

"I see. Thanks for the care."
I leave the church.

I know what I have to do.
Follow Sakura.
Bring back Ilya. Bring back Sakura.
Protect the one I love.
So what if the fight's outcome is already determined?
I still have the power to fight.
So this is no time to be hesitating.


There's no time.
I can't waste time going back home to find a weapon.
...No, these people can't be fought with weapons from my house.

Sakura and Saber.
Zouken and Assassin.
If Zouken is after Ilya, I have to assume all my enemies are at my destination.

"So, where are you going, Emiya Shirou? I do not know the situation."
"...? It's obvious. Ilya went with Sakura to protect us. She said to go to the castle if Sakura wants her formal dress. I don't know what this formal dress is, but they're likely heading to her castle."

"Formal dress...? No, never mind that. Matou Sakura has become your enemy? Then the victor of this Holy Grail War is decided."
"............"
It's irritating, but Kotomine's right.

Zouken and Sakura.
Sakura is obviously the superior Master, but she can't disobey Zouken.
...I don't know what she's trying to do with Ilya, but it'll end once she meets Zouken.
No matter how much Sakura refuses him, the crest worm in her body will control her.

"Hey, more importantly!
 Why are you following me!?"
"It will be too much for you alone.  If Ilyasviel has been kidnapped, I cannot just watch quietly."

"Wha"
I stop at the unexpected reply.
What did he just say?

"Too much for me? So you're going to help me...!?"
"Are you discontent? You will be fighting against the greatest force.
 Now that Rin cannot help you, my powers should be of assistance."


There's no way I'm discontented.
I'm happy for any help, but

"Why? There's no reason for you to help me."
"Of course not. It is just this one time. Do not consider me your ally after we rescue Ilyasviel. We can never understand each other."
"Then..."

"It is simply for mutual benefit.
 Furthermore, they defeated all my Servants. Is that not a good enough reason?"

...There's no lie in his words.
A lot has happened between us, but he has never lied to me.
I
...I lose the will and the desire to get back up.
I close my eyes as if falling asleep.

There's nothing ahead of me.
My Holy Grail War ends here.
Or rather, it never really began.
"I refuse. You're Sakura's enemy. I can't trust you with my back."
"I see. I thought I could be of some help, but this is unfortunate."
The priest stops.
...I have no time to waste.
I have to follow after Sakura as quickly as possible.

It's daybreak when my taxi arrives at the forest.
A student taking a taxi at three in the morning is suspicious enough, so wanting to be dropped off in the outskirts must've been too much.
After twelve tries, I finally found a taxi that'd drop me off at the forest, and it's already morning by the time I finally get there.

...This is my second time here.
Using my memory, I head to the castle.
...I couldn't reach it the last time I was here.
It's because I met Ilya, who was running from the shadow, on the way.


...I check my left arm.
I lost my arm at that time.
The shadow nearly killed me, and there was nothing I could do about it.
It's the same now.
I have no way to match the shadow even if I encounter it, and they also have Saber.

...It'll be the end once I encounter them.
If I'm to get Ilya back, a surprise attack will be the only way.
I'll rescue Ilya without Sakura noticing.
Then

What should I do after that?
What can I do to Sakura?
How can I return Sakura to the way I knew her?

"........."
I have no answer.
All I can do is to try to catch up to them as quickly as possible.

I emerge in a familiar place.
It's been two hours since I entered the forest.
The sun should already be up, but the trees are still shrouded in morning mist.

...This is where I stopped last time.
If the scene Ilya showed me is right, the Einzbern castle should be near here.
A bit more.
A bit more, and I'll reach the enemy base.

I come out into a clearing.
An empty, circular space within the vast forest.
The castle I saw through Ilya's eyes is standing there, just like I remembered.

There's no one around.
It's strange that there's no watch anywhere, but I can't back out even if this is a trap.

Going in from the front entrance is out of the question.
Sneaking in from a window on the second floor would be good.
"I'll go to the back. I can get in through the back door if I have to."
There's no watch, even in the back.
I climb up a tree and force my way into the second floor.

"Whoa!"
I jump inside, breaking the window.
In spite of my forced entry, the castle is dead silent.

"...Are they not on guard? Are they taking me lightly because I'm alone, or..."

Have Zouken and Sakura left already?
...That would explain things.
It's been almost a day since Sakura took Ilya.
I don't know why they came here, but maybe they've already finished their business

"No, there are human presences. And"
A bizarre atmosphere shrouds the place.
An overwhelming flow of magical energy clings to my skin like heavy fog.
...This has to be it.
This is what Sakura's magical energy was like after the crest took control.

"It's thicker on lower grounds..."
Sakura's on the first floor.
...I can look for the stairs and head down, but I should find Ilya first.
I can't do anything if she's with Sakura, but I have to go save her if she's trapped somewhere in this castle.

All the doors are unlocked.
From the second floor to the third. From the third to the fourth.
I check every room for Ilya.

And in the very back of the fourth floor...
I come across a storeroom that's unlike any of the others.

"You here, Ilya...?"
...I call out in a whisper.
It must be storage because the room is littered with junk, obstructing my view.

"............"
If Ilya isn't here, she must be with Sakura on the first floor

"Who is it...!?"
I turn around at the sound of footsteps.
Standing at the door is...
...A familiar woman in a white dress.

"You're"
She's Ilya's servant, Sella.

"Please go home, Emiya-sama. My lady does not wish to see you."
"Eh... Hold on, you mean Ilya...!?"
"...Please call her Ilyasviel-sama. You do not have the right to address her in that manner."


I'm overawed by her ice-cold voice.
"That is all of her message. Make haste if you value your life. You will die if you stay here, Emiya-sama."
Sella bows and leaves.

"...Wait, wait, Sella...!"
"........."
Maybe it was unexpected that I called her name, as she stops and looks at me.

"Yes? I cannot tell you where my lady is, nor where your friend is. My only duty is to give you this message."
Sella talks without emotion.
...I freeze at the sight.


It's not her attitude that bothers me.
...She's like her.
I don't know why I'm thinking this, but Ilya and Sella are alike.
Their faces, demeanor, build, and age are different, but it feels like they're sisters

"...I will be leaving if you have no business. Please do not let my lady's consideration go to waste."

"Ohno, Sella. I came to save Ilya, so I have no intention of bothering you.
 You're Ilya's servant, right? Then you should know that we have to get Ilya out of this castle."

"How rude.
 But as you say, she needs to be freed as quickly as possible."
"...! Right? Then tell me where she is."

"...I cannot do that. Furthermore, there is no longer any use in telling you."
Sella quietly backs away.

"Wait, I!"
At that instant.
A black dagger is fired at me from where Sella was.

"Ah..."
...My legs give way.
Pain wracks my body, and I retreat to the window.
In front of me...
...Is a white skull glowing in the dark.

"Haa, ...!"
I grope blindly for the window.
...But what good will it do, even if I find it?
This is the fourth floor, and a dagger has pierced my chest.
I'm losing blood, and I should lose a third of my blood within the next minute.

"You were a fool to come here alone."
"Haa"
"I am not like the magus. I shall quickly free you from the pain."

"Guh......!"
I twist my body.
I don't care if it is the fourth floor.
I run to escape the death that stands before me...
But my carotid artery is cut when my hands are on the windowsill...

The skull grows hazy.
"Sleep. Salvation will not be given to you, but it should be better than being eaten by that monster."
My vision blurs.

...On the verge of my death, I feel regret.
Even though I couldn't waste any time, coming here by myself was reckless
We emerge into a clearing.
An empty, circular space within the vast forest.
The castle I saw through Ilya's eyes is standing there, just like I remembered.

There's no one around.
It's strange that there's no watch anywhere, but I can't back out even if this is a trap.

"Kotomine. Can we get up to the second floor from that tree?"
Even if they don't know we're here, it'll be suicidal to go in from the front door.
It might be useless, but I have to do everything I can.

"...Right.
 If we wish to sneak in, we should use an unused waterway, but they aren't the sort to fall for such time-consuming methods.
 They will notice our intrusion once we enter the castle. I would like to go directly to where Ilyasviel is held captive and escape immediately, but"

The priest looks up at the castle, pondering.
...He narrows his eyes as if trying to look through the wall, staring at each window in turn.

"What a surprise. It seems they really do think lightly of us, Emiya."
A happy voice.
"What?"
I've never heard this tone from him before, so I doubt my ears for a second.

"W-What, Kotomine? Did you find something?"
"I did.
 Let me ask. Do you have experience in mountain climbing, Emiya Shirou?"

"............Don't tell me..."
"I mean free climbing, of course. It is vertical, but there is no overhang and there are enough holds. We can maintain a secure footing. It will be easy to climb this wall without tools. Compared to a wall of ice, this is like walking down the street."
"Wai"
Kotomine puts his hand on the wall before I can stop him.

"Wha"
He presses himself against the wall and climbs up.
He's going slow, but I see how stable he is.

"What are you doing? If you cannot find the points, copy me. You should not be so weak that four stories are too much for you.
 Oh, and leave the Black Key. We can pick it up on the way out."
The priest continues to climb as he speaks.

"He's serious."
I throw down the sword and get on the wall.
...He must have picked an easy section to climb. The rocks are pretty rough, so I can manage to get ahold of them.

You don't just use your strength to climb up.
Knowing if the next hold is safe, knowing if the small hold can support your weight, knowing if there's another hold after you move...
A vertical climb is like a puzzle of improvisation.
Even if the goal is a meter away, you have to go back down and try a new route if you can't find the next hold.

A route to the destination.
The technique of thinking two or three steps ahead only comes with experience.
That's experience I lack, so I have to copy exactly what Kotomine does.
I'll instantly fall if I miss the target by a few centimeters or grip the handle with the wrong force.

"I can't believe it. You let an amateur do something like this?"
I grumble as I climb up.
...Well, it's ridiculous, but it's not totally reckless.
Normally, one climbs like this near the top of a mountain.

The wall isn't the only thing a climber fights against.
Just as the deep sea is a sanctuary that humans cannot violate, high places are also a sacred place.

There's not enough oxygen above the altitude of six thousand meters, and untrained people cannot stay there for more than a few hours.
Nausea, dizziness, brain edema from lack of oxygen, and finally, death.
This is a hell that gets worse the higher you go.

And intense cold. Your bare skin would freeze, and even a slight scratch would turn into necrosis.
Climbing is done in such extreme environments.
Compared to that, merely climbing a wall is hardly impossible.

"But still"
...It's still hard.
I can only use the tips of my fingers.
I have to put my weight there and support my body using a small foothold.
I can't keep up with him unless I've trained every inch of my body...!

"Hm...? Hold on, she moved. I thought it was above, but it's actually below us. Emiya, go down to the third floor window and go inside."
"Heyare you crazy?!"
I'm not a spider, so I can't do such a thing

"Kotomine, there's a window...! How can I go inside!?"
"I don't care, break through it."
"...! You fraud, if it was going to be like this..."
It would've been so much easier if we'd just gone inside using that tree!

"......!"
I jump into the castle.
I break the window and jump in using the same motion.
I grab the wall with both hands, swing my body at the window, and kick my way in.

"Haah......!"
I roll across the expensive-looking carpet.
My body was falling when I swung my legs.
If I'd kicked out a bit later, I would've hit the wall and landed back-first on the ground.

"Damn, I'd die if I fell on my head from the third floor..."
It's dangerous to kick into a window and roll while scattering glass shards, but it's no worse than expected.
"......Shirou?"
The instant I raise my head...
All trifling matters escape my mind.

"Ilya."
I forget I'm in enemy territory.
I recall what happened in the yard.
Ilya told me goodbye with a false smile.

"Unbelievable. Why did you come, Shirou? There's nothing you can do now. Are you going to waste your effort again?"
A cold voice.
Ilya puts on a cold face.


I'm used to it.
I'm used to seeing that face on her, but...

"You still don't understand? You can leave Sakura to me. This is my duty, so you can just go home and..."
"Idiot. Don't say dealing with the aftermath is your duty."
I slap her across the cheek, unable to forgive her.

"Wha H-How dare you...! It's not like a gentleman to slap a lady's cheek! I-I won't forgive you if you do such a thing to me!"
"It's me that won't forgive you, you idiot...! I'd be punching you if you were a guy, you bad girl...!"

I yell back at her.
I'm happy to be able to see her, but I'm really angry.

"W-What!? I didn't do anything to make you mad! I went with Sakura to fulfill my role! It was the best decision I could make, so you don't have the right to complain"

"Shut up, I don't care about that...!
 Look, I don't know about your role. I just came to bring back a bad girl who ran away selfishly.
 I won't be tricked, no matter how much you bluff and pretend you're all right. I'm going to take you home as long as you don't want to be here...!"

"Wha W-Who's bluffing!? I'm not hating it. This body is made to be a Holy Grail. I don't like becoming the key for them, but if I can use the power of the Holy Grail, Sakura will..."

"That's called a bluff, you idiot!
 ......Look, I don't care about the Holy Grail. Ilya is Ilya. If you want to stay as yourself, just ignore all of this. Don't sacrifice your life for someone else...!"


She looks away.
She bites her lip and...
"That goes for you too, Shirou"
...Murmurs something I can't hear.

"...Fine. Let's say I don't like this whole thing. What about it? We can't beat Sakura nor run away from her.
 It's impossible to get me out of the castle. That's why Zouken's letting me roam freely.
 He'll overlook you for now, but you won't make it out of the forest if you're with me."

Her red eyes reject me, telling me to go back.
I
"I'm still taking you home. I'm not going back by myself."
I don't even need to think about it.
There's no alternative in my mind.


Ilya just stares back at me in surprise.
I take her hand.
"Let's go, Ilya. We'll go home before they find us."
I pull her small, light body and start to walk.

"I'm stunned. Anything I say to you is useless."
Ilya starts to walk without resisting.
"Really. There's no way this will turn out well."
She happily closes her hand over mine.
"I'm still taking you home. I'm not going back by myself."
I don't even need to think about it.
There's no alternative in my mind.


Ilya just stares back at me in surprise.

She happily closes her hand over mine.
Purification by the holy word.
The priest's exorcism disperses Matou Zouken's spiritual body.
Only two figures remain.
One is Kotomine Kirei, leaning against a wall with wounds all over his body, his cloak red with blood.
The other is the masked assassin, bound to a tree by the Black Keys.

"You completely eradicated the magus, Executor. Did you know he was just a collection of worms?"

He turns to the voice.
Assassin is no longer there.
The only things on the tree are the Black Keys and a small trace of blood.

"...I've known him for a long time. I knew he was a spirit that used worms to tamper with this world. It would do no good to rip his body to pieces. If one were to kill him, one would have to completely eliminate his body, or..."

"Attack the spirit itself, as you did, eh?
 I see. The magus had a strong binding to the world, but he's vulnerable to the holy words of the Bible.
 Exorcist, eh? One might say you were Matou Zouken's natural enemy."


The priest doesn't answer, but checks on his wounded body.
The bleeding has stopped.
He's out of weapons, but he suffered no fatal wounds, and his strength should return once he rests for a few minutes.

"So, what are you going to do, Assassin? Your Master is gone. My holy words should have an effect on you now that your source of magical energy is gone."
"...I would assume so. My body will soon disappear. Without a Master, I am no different from the wandering spirits in this forest. My body will degrade to that of a lowly spirit within a day, and I shall disappear from this world."

"Correct. I can harm Servants without Masters.
 So, what will you do? Will you avenge your Master?"
"I am not so foolish as that. He suffered defeat because of his own arrogance. It is not my fault.
 But still, something does not make sense, and that I must ask of you."

"You must mean how your Zabaniya failed.
 I believe you obtained your arm from Shaytaan, but it will have no effect on me as long as it bears the name of the fallen angel.
 That arm punishes humans, so it cannot curse one of its own kind. As my heart is not human, it is strong against such a curse."

"I thought so. Your heart was the same as that girl's.
 You must already be tainted."
The priest doesn't answer.
He merely smiles ironically.

"...But how did you know? You could not act as you did unless you knew my arm would have no effect on you.
 Your intention was to have me use my Noble Phantasm, correct?"
"Yes. I already knew about your arm, Assassin.
 A cursed arm that creates an image of the target's heart and swaps it with the real heart.
 That's how you killed my Servant."

"! Then you..."
"Yes, I watched it until he died.
 It's natural that I knew about your arm. Your blunder was made the instant you killed Lancer."
"Damn, that was indeed a blunder."
Assassin tut-tuts in self-deprecation.
His hostility disappears at the same time.
He must be satisfied with the answer, as he quickly retreats.

"...So he went to look for another Master.
 I'd assume his next Master would be Matou Sakura"
That's not a problem for the priest.
It's fine as long as Matou Zouken doesn't kill Matou Sakura.

Zouken's wish is immortality.
He can achieve his wish by having Sakura's body turn into the Holy Grail.
The curse in the Holy Grail will not hatch if the old man is alive.
It's meaningless if Sakura becomes his tool.
She needs to remain a Master.
Because...

        'You will never find it.
         You were defective from birth'


He gets dizzy.
It must be because of the fatigue and loss of blood.
The priest leans against the wall and closes his eyes.

      It all happened ten years ago.

'Defective from birth'

The man did everything he could after accepting the fact.
He couldn't understand morals, but had common sense. So his teenage years were spent trying to overcome his defect.
But it never happened.
The man's purgatories and sufferings were entirely useless.
And his final attempt was a woman.

It's a simple story.
Every human wishes to love one of the opposite sex, have a family, and die peacefully.
Even if one may detest the peace, one can only dream about it.
This man is no exception.
He wished for such a thing, even though he felt no fascination in it.
He loved a woman, trying to earn ordinary happiness.

The man chose a woman with no future.
She was terminally ill, only expected to live for a few years.
Did he choose her because of that, or was that his only choice?
He still doesn't know.

Their life together lasted for about two years.
The man tried to love the woman.
The woman tried to love the man, did love him, and even had his child.
But the result didn't change.
It was because the man derived his happiness from the woman's suffering and his child's despair.
The more he tried to love, the more their suffering saved him.

The contradiction didn't make the man suffer. He doesn't even know if he suffered.
But the more the woman tried to cure him, the more he wanted to see her grieve.

The woman was a saint. She was sickly, but she was still a saint for him.
It need not be said how faithful she was or how deeply she understood his anger.
That's why the man was in despair.
No human will ever understand him and try to heal him to her degree. And this woman still could not fill the void within him.

Thenthere was no need to live and question right and wrong.
He was born defective.
His birth was some kind of mistake.
He concluded that if his existence was a mistake, it was best to disappear. And he went to bid goodbye to the woman before he died.
He made her his wife as an experiment, so it's his natural duty to go tell her of his end.

The woman loved Kotomine.
Kotomine tried to love the woman.
That's all there is to this story.

The end came relatively quickly.
"I could not love you."
That's all the man said in the room made of stone.
The dying woman smiled. She was unable to stand up, because her body was now composed of just skin and bone.
"No. I love you."
With a smile, she took her own life.

There was no way to stop her, and stopping her was meaningless.
The woman had a fatal disease. She would eventually die. He knew that when he chose her.

The woman, covered in blood, looked up at the man and smiled.
"See. You're crying."
He wasn't crying, of course.
It's just that the woman saw it that way.
The woman used her death to prove to him that he could love, and that he deserved to live.
The man silently left the room and broke away from the teachings of God.

Yes.
He certainly felt sad.
But not because she died.
The man, at that time, thought...
'How terrible. If she was going to die, I wanted to kill her myself.'

He grieved over losing the chance to enjoy her death.

It happened long ago.
He can't remember her voice or her face.
But sometimes he thinks, 'I wanted to kill her.'
Is that for his pleasure, or
Is it grief over wanting to kill the one he loved with his own hands?

He cuts off his thought process whenever the answer flickers in his head.
It's something that should be hidden forever.
The woman's death was meaningless.
Her devotion couldn't change him.
But the man didn't want to consider her death to be worthless.
So he stopped searching for answers.

...It all happened long ago.
The memory of the man who feeds on others' misfortunes.
The man later meets his nemesis.
Emiya Kiritsugu.
A magus that cast away what the man might have wanted


He opens his eyes.
It seems he fell asleep.
He checks his condition, starts to walk to catch up to Emiya Shirou, and...

"No, you can't go anywhere.
      Because you die here."

...Is interrupted by a girl.

She has completely changed.
Her black outfit is her shadow.
She's covering her body with her own dark magical energy.
The amount and the presence of her magical energy is beyond human capabilities.
She's at the same level as pure heroic spirits, the Counter Guardians.

"...You are completely tainted, Matou Sakura.
 You cannot change to that degree unless your mind is attuned to the curse.
 So you've accepted the fact that you're a human-eating monster."
Even though the priest wished for it, he still criticizes the girl.
As if to blame her for being intoxicated with her power.

"...Hah. But is it wrong to be drunk with your power?
 It can't be helped.
 Everyone picked on me too much. I think I would've endured it longer if everyone was nicer to me."
"Oh. Endure what?"

"Myself, priest-san.
 I finally understand now. I hate this world.
 The Tohsaka family that threw me away. Nee-san, who lived without any troubles. My scary grandfather and my pitiful brother. The people living peacefully without knowing about my pain."

"I can't allow such things now.
 ...I know I'm just taking my anger out on others. I know it's wrong, but I still think this way.
 Yes.
 I wonder what kind of face the people who haven't helped me will make when they realize I exist."

The girl smiles, as if it's a sacred pleasure.
The priest doesn't change his expression.
He keeps staring at the girl as if regarding something foul.

"You have changed, Matou Sakura. I see, your darkness was one of the qualities to adapt."
"Yes, I've changed. I'm not the old Matou Sakura. That weak girl doesn't exist anymore.
 ...Yes. Everyone tormented me until now. So I'm just getting back at them. The me who sat there and endured is gone."

She laughs.
Double personality.
The original Matou Sakura disappeared, and the other personality surfaced.
That's the only logical reason for her change.
But...
"What are you talking about? You don't need to hide it, Matou Sakura."
The priest quickly denies it.

"WWhat do you mean?"
"I said there's no need to hide it.
 You are not another personality. You were swallowed by the mud and have become addicted to violence, but you are still Matou Sakura. You don't need to prepare another personality to excuse yourself."
Her face stiffens.
He's absolutely right.
The girl grits her teeth and glares back at the priest.

"What are you saying!? You're the one who made me like this...!"
The girl's shadow reacts to her hateful voice.
A blazing infringement.
The shadow covers the ground in an instant.

"I won't deny it. I kept you alive so that you would remain its Master. You measured up to my expectations, and you are about to give birth to Avenger.
 You have easily accomplished what I could not."

"It wasn't easy at all...! You don't know how painful it was, how much pain I'm going through right now...!"
"I don't know, and there's no need to know. I'm not so mad as to listen to a girl's complaint."

"! ............I see.
 You're right. I don't want you to know.
 I won't let you feel compassion. I'm in a position where I can make anyone realize whatever I want."
She smiles cruelly.


The priest retreats without any hesitation.
He quickly backs away, like when he captured Matou Zouken.

The priest retreats with one jump.
She may have vast magical energy, but she's still inexperienced.
She has no experience with battle, and she's unskilled as a magus. It's easy for him to retreat.

"How foolish. Do you think you can get away from me?"

She smiles.
The priest falls to the ground at that instant.

"Guhgah......!"
He rolls down.
He falls to the ground, coughing up blood.
"Haahm, guh......!"
It doesn't stop.
He can't stop coughing up blood. Every time he tries to breathe, it wells up in his throat.

"How does it feel to have someone grab hold of your heart? Your life's under my control, no matter where you are."
"Mmguh!"
"You died ten years ago. Emiya Kiritsugu shot your heart and you died. But you stayed alive because of one reason."

"You're that... hmm, who was it? It's the Servant I ate before, but I guess his name doesn't matter.
 That gold person was showered with the contents of the Holy Grail, which connected him to it. But it couldn't taint that man, so it flowed into you, his Master. Right?
 And you were resurrected.
 Avenger. Your life was saved because Angra Manyu supplied you with magical energy."

"HaI see. Then this is..."
"Yes. You're connected to Angra Manyu. But I'm Angra Manyu.
 So I squashed it. I destroyed the fake heart that kept you alive.
 I can squash your organs too if you want.
 I can pull out your insides, no matter where you are."

She raises her hand.
How can she say 'if you want'?
The girl has no intention of keeping him alive.
No matter how much he may beg for his life, she'll laugh as she kills him.
He'll give her back his fake life.
Because it's hers.
Even if it's just a speck next to her total magical energy, there's no reason for her to let the priest keep it.

"Goodbye. I appreciate the fact that you saved me."
She grasps her slender fingers together as if to twist apart an invisible doll.
A crushing sound.
The priest's body is squeezed like a rag.
One more twist.
The priest will die in the next second.
But right before that...

"! Ah, uh, ah!?"
The girl doubles over in pain.
...She coughs up blood.
She scratches the ground, as if begging for help.

"Kuit hurts, no... don't... come in!"
The shadow expands.
...What happened? The shadow on her body expands, then slowly shrinks back to the original size.

"......No way...... Berserker lost...?"
There's no other explanation.
Berserker was defeated.
He died, dissolved into pure magical energy, and was consumed by her, the Holy Grail.

"AhAh"
Her mind distorts.
The personality called Matou Sakura is pushed even further into a corner now.
...She can't move any farther, but the great soul pushes her against the wall.

"Ah."
...She'll disappear.
She'll disappear.
Matou Sakura will disappear.
"Before that..."
She thinks of killing the priest, looks up, and is annoyed by her failure to follow through.

"Fine. He's... going... to die... anyway."
There's no one at the ruin.
On the ground where Kotomine Kirei lay is his blood-soaked outfit.
We reach the forest's edge faster than I expected.
It's probably because I had Ilya's guidance.
The car I arrived in is gone.
We started walking to town, stopped a car, and got a lift.

We're both filthy after running through the forest, making us look really suspicious.
So I jumped out in front of a car to stop it, and Ilya used suggestion on the driver to make him pick us up.
Man.
I never thought I'd get a ride like this.

"We're home, Shirou. Let's go in."
"Eh?"
We're back at my place in an instant.
The sun's setting.
It seems I fell asleep on the way back.

The sun has set by the time I make it to the living room.
It's past seven o'clock already.


Something's wrong.
Time's passing by too fast.
It was afternoon when I stepped into the house, so it's not possible for it to be night as soon as I step into the living room.

"Ilya. Isn't time passing by too fast?"
I talk to Ilya, standing beside me.


But Ilya isn't there.
Ilya is...
"Hm? The dinner was good, Shirou."
...Already in the living room, saying strange things.

"Dinner?"
"Yeah. I was surprised you wanted to get energy before anything, but I'm glad we did. You were so enthusiastic while you were cooking."


There are remnants of dinner on the table.
There are dishes in the sink.
Come to think of it, I feel pretty full.
It seems I really did make dinner.

"......That's strange. Did we have this in stock?"
"Nope. That's why we were dropped off at the shopping district to get some groceries."


I look through my memory.
......
............
..................
........................Well.
I guess that's what happened.

"I see. I guess I'm talking nonsense. So we had dinner, huh?"
"Yeah. All that's left is to rest."

"Hmyeah, we have to rest. I'm going to go change in my room. I need to talk, so please stay up. I'll be back right away."
Ilya nods.
I raise my hand in apology and leave the living room.

And the next thing I know, I'm in my room.
The instant I step out of the living room, I'm on the floor in my bedroom.

"Ah... Guh!"
I wake up because of the piercing pain.
A sword's pierced in my chest.
That's the first thing I imagine because my chest is hot and numb, and it feels like my life is draining out from it.

"Guh"
There's no sword, of course.
It's just an illusion.
The left side of my chest is simply rebelling against my left arm.
But I finally realize.
My sense of time.
The intermittent scenes are...

"...I see. It's not my sense of time that's odd."
It's just that my mind is screwed up.
It's not that I have no memory. I just can't record the events into my brain.

I can't hold events in my mind unless I concentrate on them.
It's natural that I can't remember anything that happened after I left the forest.
I can't stay conscious unless I'm in pain, like now.

"This is bad."
I frantically grasp at my fading consciousness.
Unless I consciously focus my mind, Emiya Shirou will disappear.
Only pain or the utmost concentration can preserve my memories.
In short, I have to maintain the level of concentration I had when I was trying to insert the Magic Circuit into my spine.


...I'm stumped.
I can't keep this up forever, and I don't know how long it'll work.

"...Wait. That means I shouldn't sleep."
Once I fall asleep, I won't be able to wake up.
Once I fall asleep, "Emiya Shirou" will never return.
Even if my body's unwounded, my mind would be scattered.


I raise my body.
I search through my desk. I need a small blade. Something I can hide in my right hand that'll dig into my flesh if I make a fist.
I can't keep up the concentration I have during training.
I have to clench my fist every time I relax so that the pain will keep me conscious.

"...Oh. It's not a blade, but this might do."
I find the crystal from that day.
...The pendant I found beside me after I was killed by Lancer.
I don't know how much magical energy was originally in this, but now there's not even enough for one strengthening magic left in it.

...That's right. Now, I can clearly think about who this pendant belongs to, and who could have saved me that night.
After all, she was the only other person at school at that time. I don't know why she saved me, but she wouldn't need a reason to save a life.

"Ah!"
My consciousness starts to fade away.
I'll think about it later.
I'll fall unconscious if I think about happy things and relax.

I check my condition.
I released the seal on my left arm.
I put the Shroud back on it, but it's only there to ease my mind.
According to Kotomine, the switch would be tripped if I used Archer's arm.
He said there'd nothing I could do after that.


But I can still move my body.
The problem is my mind, but I can stay conscious as long as I stay awake.
As for projection... I can probably project three more times using Archer's arm.

I know I can manage it once.
I'm scared about the second time.
The third will be fatal. I think my body will self-destruct, even if my mind's still alive.

"............"
I close my eyes and strain my ears.
...I hear creaking sounds along with my heartbeat.

...The thing invading my body from Archer's arm.
It gets harder to suppress his Reality Marble the more I use his Blade Works.  Eventually, an infinite number of blades will be created inside my body instead of outside.
...I don't even want to imagine what'll happen.
A thousand blades will pierce my body from within, killing me instantly.

"Don't kid me. I won't kill myself."
I'm in a hopeless condition.
I accept the whole situation.
But I reject the facts as they stand.
I won't die, and I won't self-destruct.
Not waking up after I fall asleep is just a product of my frightened imagination.

I'll be saved.
I'll be saved once I do everything I need to.
It's meaningless otherwise.
I said I'll protect Sakura no matter what.
So I can't just die selfishly.

"That's right. I have to contact Tohsaka first."
I don't have time.
I'll go to her house.
I'm worried about whether Kotomine's all right, but he's not my ally anymore now that we've saved Ilya.
I can't ask for his help again, but the promise to...

It's past nine o'clock.
I thought I came back right away, but it's been two hours already.

"Sorry to keep you waiting, Ilya. I'm going to Tohsaka's house, so let's go together."
"Rin's house? I don't mind, but why?"

"Eh... why? We have to meet up with Tohsaka. And I'm worried about how she's doing.
 Kotomine said she'd heal by tonight, but I can't really trust him. If she's not doing well, I'll need to look after her."

"Okay. That's fine, but Shirou..."
Ilya points to the wall.
Then.

"I'm glad to know you're worrying about me. As you can see, I'm all right.
 But if you were that worried about me, I wish you'd have come by my house before heading off to the forest."

"T-Tohsaka...!? When did you get here...?"

"I was here about an hour ago. I heard from Ilya what happened at the forest."

Tohsaka's in a bad mood... No, she's angry.
It seems she doesn't like the fact that I went to the forest without her.

"I can't help it. I thought I had to act as quickly as possible, and Ilya was in serious danger.
 ...Right, Ilya?"

"......Yeah. I wasn't locked up anywhere, but I could've been taken to the Great Holy Grail and had my heart taken out at any time.
 Zouken wanted to open the gate as soon as he took control of Sakura. I would be dead right now if Shirou and Kotomine had come a bit later."

"See. I wouldn't have made it if I'd waited for you."
"Who knows? So it all depended on Sakura, right? Tell me the truth, Ilya."

"Oh, you can tell?
 Yeah, there was a bit more time. Sakura's strong, so she won't easily break. I think there was about one more day to spare until she lost herself and fell under Zouken's control."

"I thought so. You shouldn't pamper Shirou too much. A little strictness is just right for him."
"You're right. I'll be grateful if you see to that."

The two criticize me.
But if the time limit was a day, I don't think we would've made it if I'd waited for Tohsaka.
I was faced with an important choice in the forest, but in exchange, I'm able to regain the time the three of us can spend together.

"!"
...I concentrate hard, since I'm starting to relax.
It seems the tension faded away during the conversation.

"......Hm......? Hold on, Ilya.
 You said Sakura might last one more day. Then the remaining time we have is..."

"Half a day at most. ...No, no matter how hard Sakura tries, Avenger is about to be born. Once that happens, she will change completely.  Nobody can save Sakura, and nobody will be saved."

Avenger...?
Tohsaka and I frown at the strange word.

"Yes, Avenger.
 It's the eighth class in the Holy Grail War. It's a 'violation' that the Einzberns summoned by breaking the rules.
 That's what tainted the contents of the Great Holy Grail.
 It's the main body that assimilated with Sakura, projecting the shadow because it couldn't go into the outside world.
 It's something that should not exist, consuming human lives to take form."

"That's Avengeran anti-hero that the Einzbern Master summoned in the third ritual."

"You know about it, Ilya...!? You know what that shadow is, and what Sakura's possessed by...!?"
"Yeah. I got the information out of Sakura, so I understand what's going on.
 What we have to do. What, exactly, you've made into your enemy."

Ilya closes her eyes once.
...Is that resignation?
Ilya sighs and then stares at us.

"What I'm about to talk about is the heart of the matter, and it's nothing that concerns you two. You shouldn't be burdened with this.
 Shirou, Rin. As you two are the last Masters in the Holy Grail War, I shall tell you the truth."

"Ilya?"
Tohsaka looks at Ilya in surprise.
I do likewise.
Ilya shows calmness and emptiness as if she's someone else.

"Everything started two hundred years ago.
 No, the journey of those who seek the Holy Grail began long before that. But two hundred years ago, the ritual was begun in this land."

"I'll start from there.
 The Holy Grail grants any wish. Einzbern, Makiri, and Tohsaka cooperated to conduct a ritual to summon the Holy Grail.
 That's how the Holy Grail War came to be. A murderous battle between seven summoned Servants to determine the ownership of the Holy Grail.
 Magi who are chosen as Masters become the hosts of the Servants and kill each other until only one magus remains.
 That's the ostensible reason for the Holy Grail War that you two know of."

"You don't look surprised, Rin. So you had some idea of it, huh?"

"...Somewhat. I knew all along that I was being used, but I didn't mind it too much.
 I'm reaping the benefits by using somebody else's system. We're both using each other.
 I'm not stupid enough to get angry over something so trivial."

"Really? Then I don't have to explain that the order is reversed? How about you, Shirou? Did you already know that the process of making the Servants fight is unnecessary?"


...Well, I did know.

Servants are summoned by the Holy Grail.
The heroic spirits are summoned to determine whether the summoner deserves the Holy Grail.
Once summoned, they make a contract with a Master to stay in this world and obtain the Holy Grail. Then they go out to defeat the other Masters and Servants.

...In and of itself, that's not a problem.
But once I found out the defeated heroic spirits are absorbed into the Holy Grail, something felt off.
Heroic spiritsServants are only a factor in determining which Master is suited for the Holy Grail.
So why are they taken into the Holy Grail after their purpose has been served?

"...So does that mean heroic spirits are needed for the Holy Grail War, and Masters are just a tool to summon them?"

"Right. In the ritual of the war, Masters are mere receptors to summon the Servants. Once they've done that, they can die at any time.
 The heroic spirits are the only ones needed to complete the Holy Grail.
 Heroic spirits are pure souls separate from the time axis.  Though they are outside of this world's logic, they can still influence it."

"That's the power they needed.
 They tried to exit into the outer world using that power.
 That's the real purpose of the Holy Grail in this land.
 The Holy Grail Wars were waged to create a phenomenon, a miracle, that is still out of human reach."

"That's the great ritual to attain immortality that's said to have been lost by the Einzberns.
 Not a heroic spirit or a holy spirit, but a soul of a mere human that's fated to disappear from this world.  Bringing it about is an act of God."

"The name of the miracle is 'Heavens Feel'.
 It's the golden cup that's the third of the five existing sorceries."

"SSorceries!? You mean 'those' sorceries...!?"

The air tenses up.
Ilya says that the Holy Grail is a ritual to perform a sorcery.

Sorcery.
A divine mystery that cannot be reached with magic. An impossible phenomenon that cannot be achieved by modern people.
It's the ultimate goal of every magus, and those who achieve it are called "sorcerers" with envy and awe.

There are five sorceries acknowledged by the Magic Association.
As I'm not even in the Association, I have no way to know, but I've heard that there are five sorceries and that there are about four sorcerers.

"W-Wait...! So the Third Sorcery is the materialization of the soul!? But Servants are materialized souls too...!"

"No. The system does use a part of the Third Sorcery, but the heroic spirits are summoned.
 Servants aren't alive as part of this world or time. It's too imperfect to be the Third Sorcery. And heroic spirits can take form in this world without the help of sorcery as long as they have a host."

"Heavens Feel is not a spell that duplicates a soul perceived in the past.
 It's actually a spell to make an existence of a higher dimension that can take a spirit form and still influence the physical world.
 It takes a soul and elevates it to the next level of life."

"Next stepthat's certainly serious, but...
 Even though the details are different, all sorceries are a way to reach the origin! What does it have to do with the Holy Grail?"

"No. First of all, there's only one administrated land in Japan that can activate a sorcery.
 I know the ley line in Fuyuki is first-class, but there's not enough distortion to connect to the origin."

"Right. It's not distorted enough to reach the origin. That's why you make a hole. If the path is obstructed, you have to destroy the wall yourself, right?"

"The Holy Grail War is the process of destroying the wall.
 The process accumulates enough magical energy to grant any wish. But that's just a secondary matter for the Einzbern family. And it was also an advertisement to call for the Masters, the sacrifices."

"The Einzberns only needed a giant magic circle that could store great amounts of magical energy without attracting the notice of the Magic Association.
 The head of the Tohsaka family at that time cooperated with them.
 This country doesn't receive much attention from the Association, and there aren't many first-class lands that rank next to Aozaki's land.
 Fuyuki City was almost the perfect test site, meeting all the requirements."

"You should be able to figure out the rest.
 There are two kinds of Holy Grails that govern the Holy Grail War.
 The Holy Grail in this land and the Holy Grail Einzbern prepares.
 The former is a magic circle that uses the land administrated by Tohsaka.
 This is called the Great Holy Grail.
 The key that the Einzbern family prepares for each ritual is called the Holy Grail."

"The Great Holy Grail administers the system of the Holy Grail War. The Holy Grail collects the souls of the defeated heroic spirits and acts as the reactor core to activate the Great Holy Grail."

"And once the Holy Grail collects enough souls to activate the Great Holy Grail, it uses the heroic spirits' souls to open a hole.
 The Great Holy Grail fixes the small hole created when the heroic spirits return to their original place after their roles are fulfilled. This opens up the passage to the origin that humans cannot reach."

"Of course, this is just the first step. Your wish isn't granted even if the hole is opened. The path to the origin is too far."

"Butthe one who obtains the Holy Grail gains access to unlimited magical energy.
 The other side has large quantities of unused mana unlike anything seen on this side.  For an ordinary magus, it's nothing short of a miracle."

"......I see. So the Great Holy Grail is the magic circle which serves as the foundation, and the Holy Grail is the key to activate it.
 The Holy Grail Wars must occur on a sixty-year cycle to accumulate enough mana to summon the heroic spirits."

"There's no way you can carry out such a summoning with one person's magical energy.
 The Great Holy Grail draws mana from the land slowly so as not to deplete it, and once it's full"

"Yes, it summons the heroic spirits as Servants.
 But you need an incentive to summon the heroic spirits. They won't heed your call unless you give them what they want.
 That's why the Holy Grail was prepared to reward them."

"...Well, that's a deception from the start.
 The Einzberns just wanted the souls of the heroic spirits.
 They didn't care about their rank. They just wanted strong souls.
 To hide that fact, they created the Holy Grail War as a cover. They deceived the Servants and Masters and made them kill each other."

"...Well, I guess that started from the second ritual.
 The first was conducted in a foolishly honest manner and failed right away because the three families fought for its exclusive right."

"So the rule was made starting with the second ritual.
  Outsiders were called and made to fight for the Holy Grail.
 Masters from outside the families were just an inconvenience after the Servants had been summoned, so it more efficient to have them killed in battle.
 It was convenient for the three families because they could legitimately kill their collaborators."

"Unbelievable. So the rule for Masters to kill each other exists because they couldn't decide who gets the ownership by talking and had to resort to violence?"

"Yup. But choosing the last magus standing proved to be an even better method than expected.
 It's just like you. There were Servants and Masters that found out they were tricked, but it seems they didn't care. It's because you obtain the Holy Grail if you win."

Tohsaka's convinced.
"........."
...In short, the Holy Grail War is not a battle to obtain the Holy Grail, but a ritual to escape to the outside world.

Attempts to reach the outside world.
According to hermeticism, there's a power that governs dimensional theory outside of this world.
It's called the 'swirl of the origin', and it's a coordinate that's considered to be the beginning of all things.
It's the start and the end of all creation. It's the seat of God, recording everything and able to create anything.

"........."
But I really don't care about that.
My father would've understood what a big deal it is, but it doesn't concern me.
What's possessing Sakura is much more important to me than how it all started.

"Ilya. I don't care about the real purpose of the war. It has nothing to do with us, just like you said.
 More importantly, tell us about the thing you mentioned earlier."

"It has nothing to do with us!? We're talking about sorcery here! And the Third Sorcery at that! It's the taboo out of all taboos that's been kept a secret even within the association!
 If you're a magus, you can't ignore something like this"

"I can. ...Man, why do you have the wrong idea, Tohsaka?
 This isn't the time to be talking about something that can't succeed anyway."
"C-Can't succeed? What are you basing that on?"

"Hey now. I don't know why, but the Holy Grail War has never had a victor. That means there's something wrong with the ritual.
 ...First of all, how will you explain what's happening to Sakura? If the Holy Grail's a path to reach sorcery, does that mean Sakura's like that because of sorcery?"
Maybe I convinced her, because she shuts her mouth.

"So, Ilya. Why did the Holy Grail War turn out like this?
 Kotomine said there's something in the Holy Grail.
 So is this that Avenger thing? And he's not in the Holy Grail, Sakura or Ilya, but in the magic circle you called the Great Holy Grail?"

"Oh, Kotomine would know, wouldn't he?
 He's a magus tainted by Avenger, just like Sakura. He already knows what's inside the Holy Grail."
"Eh...? Kotomine and Sakura are the same...?"

"That's right. This concerns you two.
 This is about what Zouken's trying to obtain, what's changing Sakura, what's hiding in the Holy Grail, and what's tainting the souls of the heroic spirits.
 Its class name is Avenger.
 The heroic spirit that's about to take a living form through the power of the Holy Grail, a successful example of the Third Sorcery."

"...What? What was all that about sorceries not having to do with this? It does concern them."

"No. Avenger's materialization isn't sorcery carried out by the Holy Grail. From the start, it is a heroic spirit with that specific attribute.
 It can take form within the Holy Grail because it's Avenger.
 The Holy Grail merely summoned an avenger that can use the Third Sorcery, so it doesn't mean that the Great Holy Grail used the Third Sorcery."

"......? So in short, it's a monster that can materialize?
 It's someone who can embody the Third Sorcery even if the Great Holy Grail doesn't?"

"Yes. It all started during the third ritual.
 The first one was a failure. Einzbern was defeated quickly in the second war, and in desperation, they summoned a spirit that specialized in killing."

"They used an old scripture, a foreign folklore they obtained, as catalyst to summon the worst evil possible.
 They summoned what they shouldn't have summoned to kill all the other Masters, to activate the Great Holy Grail, and to keep all the achievement to themselves.
 The spirit's name is Angra Manyu.
 A murderous anti-hero that embodies every curse in this world."

"Angra... Manyu?"
...Hold on.
Angra Manyu is the name of the ancient Persian devil.
It's the embodiment of evil, the greatest devil in Zoroastrianism.  It fights a nine-thousand-year battle againts Ahura Mazda, protector of human goodness.
Zoroastrianism is a story mainly about the battle between these two gods. It's the first religion to come up with the doctrine of duality, the angels and the devil.

But the story contains no hero named Angra Manyu.
First of all, how can someone crowned with the name of the king of devils become a heroic spirit?

"That's not possible, Ilya. The Holy Grail can only call on heroic spirits, and you don't need the Holy Grail if you can reproduce phenomena on the divine spirit level.
 No, first of all, there can't be a heroic spirit with the name Angra Manyu. Even if there was, it would be a nameless evil spirit that left no mark on history. Even if it were summoned, its soul wouldn't be compatible with the Holy Grail."

"...Ilya. What did the Einzberns' Master summon?"

"I said Angra Manyu, Rin.
 ...He was certainly nameless, and not a devil. But a hero with the name Angra Manyu did exist."

"...Yes, the story takes place a long time ago. Insanely long ago, in a very small world.
 It was a hero that lived in a small, nameless village that practiced Zoroastrianism."

"I don't know how distorted their doctrine was.
 I don't know what led them to that idea.
 But they lived cleanly and righteously in accordance with their precepts.
 People are supposed to value goodness, protect the light, and live virtuous lives.
 For these people, segregated from the rest of the world, this supplication was absolute. It was probably the only source of human pride that they knew."

"Yes.
 The people in the village earnestly wished for everyone to live in peace.
 So everyone could be free from malice and live pure, upright lives.
 They renounced such human concerns as hunger, conflict, love, and hate. They were proud to be worthy of God's blessing."

"But it was impossible.
 People can't be freed from malice just through clean, righteous living.
 From the moment we are born, there is evil in us. You must take certain measures if you want to separate evil from yourself.
 Andthose measures were taken."

"They came up with a way to save not just their small village, but the whole world.
 It's hard to make everyone do good.
 But you can prove everyone's goodness.
 ...You just need one person.
 If one person embodies all the evils of the world, the rest of the people cannot be evil, no matter what.
 They seriously believed in such a simple, child-like theory."

"And one young man was chosen as a sacrifice.
 They captured him, carved every cursed word onto his body, forced every sin imaginable upon him, and held him responsible for all evils in the world.
 That's all.
 A small world. But an ultimate evil was born in this one complete world."

"The people cursed, scorned, feared, yet adored this man.
 They believed they were pure and righteous, since all the world's evil was within him.
 They seriously believed it'd save everyone in the world and created a devil.
 To demonstrate human goodness, they continuously tortured one man until he went insane. No, they would not allow him to die until he succumbed to old age."

"...The name of the devil that corrupts men.
 He was given the name Angra Manyu, and was irrationally hated by everyone in the world."

"I don't know if he really did turn into a devil during the process.
 But everyone in his village believed him to be so, and they treated him accordingly. They hated and feared him, but he was the proof of their goodness. They revered him as the sign of their salvation."

"He was the object of everyone's hate, but he saved people.
 His existence pardoned everyone of their evil deeds.
 Though his method was unusual, he still saved people.
 He became a hero for the villagers."

"And a hero was born.
 Hated by people, losing his self... Someone who transformed into exactly what they wanted. A helpless sacrifice that came to represent all the world's evil."

"That's the anti-hero Angra Manyu.
 An ordinary person without any special talent that was determined to be all evils of the world.
 The king of devils that approves of all six billion evils in Zoroastrianism. He's a curse made by a concept of ancient people."

Ilya finishes her story with no sign of bitterness or contempt.
...Anti-hero.
Kotomine introduced me to the term when the war started.

"............"
...But.
If Ilya's story is true, the guy who turned into Angra Manyu is still burdened with all the sins.
It's because that's his reason of existence.

A heroic spirit who's had six billion sins pushed onto him.
...If a guy like that is summoned, all that'll happen is a big massacre.
It'd only be natural for him to hate people, and first of all, everyone around him established him to be evil.

...Angra Manyu.
So the man is using Sakura to take revenge on the people... no, to carry out the role people pushed onto him?

"So I understand the story of Avenger... Angra Manyu.
 But why is he in the Holy Grail? He's just an ordinary person, right? Even if he's given a devil's name and treated like one, he's still just a human.
 That wouldn't turn him into a monster capable of eating the entire town."

"...Yeah. Angra Manyu is human. He was just an ordinary man, but was forced to become a heroic spirit. So there wasn't any problem, originally."

"...The Einzbern family summoned Angra Manyu in the third war.
 But the summoned heroic spirit was weak.
 The anti-hero was defeated in the early stage of the war, and the Holy Grail took him in. The Master of Einzbern grieved how this ordinary human could be a devil that destroys the human world."

"...Yes. The heroic spirit was merely human.
 A human that cursed the world.
 A human who everyone wanted to represent their evil.
 ...So he had no power. He was merely constructed by the people around him.
 But everything reversed the instant he was taken in by the Holy Grail."

"The Holy Grail grants wishes.
 When defeated, Servants are reduced to raw magical energy and are taken in by the Holy Grail to await their release. They lose their individual personalities and stay in the Holy Grail as an omnipotent power.
 But Angra Manyu was different. He was a heroic spirit that others wished for.  He was intended to be evil, regardless of his personality."

"No way. Could he..."
"Yes. The Holy Grail grants every wish.
 He was a mere human, but wasn't treated as one. So he was an embodiment of people's wishes.
 Sothe instant Angra Manyu was taken in by the Holy Grail, the Holy Grail accepted a wish."

"An existence that should not be.
 The heroic spirit constructed from people's selfish wishes was finally given flesh within the wish-granting Holy Grail.
 ...Five hundred years under the Makiri and a thousand under the Einzbern are nothing.
 After all, he's an ideal human that has been wished for since the age of gods, over two thousand years ago."

"That's what that shadow is. It finally obtained form as a heroic spirit.
 Angra Manyu used Servants' colorless magical energy to embody all evils of the world.
 Wanting only to be evil.
 It slowly matured with an ability to curse all six billion people."

"Then what? The contents of the Holy Grail have already been tainted by him? The wish the Holy Grail grants is already determined, and the fourth war took place only to store up the magical energy needed to give him form?"

"Yes. I don't know how much Kiritsugu knew about Angra Manyu.
 But believing the shadow leaking from it to be dangerous, he destroyed the Holy Grail."

"And his course of action was right.
 No matter what the previous Angra Manyu was, the Angra Manyu that formed inside the Holy Grail is real. It will become the greatest evil in the world, a devil that will kill every human being alive."

"But thanks to Kiritsugu's resolve, Angra Manyu was left unborn within the Great Holy Grail.
 Kotomine and Sakura received parts of it.
 Zouken must've known that a Servant was about to be born in the Holy Grail.
 That's why he implanted a piece of it in Sakura, creating a link between her and that Servant.
 He made Sakura a Master so that she can control the Servant once it emerges."

"No matter what Avenger is, it's still a Servant. No Servant, no matter how strong, can disobey his Master.
 That's Zouken's plan. He wants to use Sakura to obtain Angra Manyu."

Hold on.
Does that mean Sakura has a contract with this Servant, Avenger?

"Are you serious? Even if Sakura controls Angra Manyu that way, she can't resist the taint of the magical energy.
 She's already changed that much when Angra Manyu is still inside the Holy Grail, so her personality will disappear completely once it comes out. Then being a Master won't matter."

"That's fine. Zouken isn't worried about Sakura's personality.  What matters to him is her body and its connection to Angra Manyu."

"He's planning to take over her empty body after her personality disappears.
 ...I don't think you know, but Zouken can take over anyone's body as long as the worm bearing his soul exists. That's how he stayed alive until now.
 From the start, Sakura was just a body to eventually possess."

Then what?
The thing possessing Sakura.
If what's changing her is a contract with a Servant

"Zouken kidnapped me, probably because he didn't want to let Sakura open the gate.
 He wanted me to take the role of the Holy Grail, allowing him to take over Sakura's body once she became Angra Manyu's Master."

"I guess he plans to take over Angra Manyu in time, since a soul given flesh is a living example of the Third Sorcery. It's like speaking ill of a perfect God because you're a human with desires."

"......The definition of God's creation... It's something that's made from people's wishes, but not affected by people's intentions.
 Well, I bet any god will turn into a devil if it reflects Zouken's personality. That must be why Kotomine considered him his enemy."

"I get it. That's enough, right, Shirou?"
"Huh?"
Tohsaka's voice brings me back to the present.

"It's not 'huh'. We know our enemy, and we know Zouken's intention. Then we don't even need to talk about the rest."


...We don't even need to talk about the rest, huh?
She's right.
What's in the Holy Grail.
The disaster from ten years ago will be repeated if he comes out.

...No, that's an understatement.
He'll kill countless people if we let him be.
Yes.
Sakura's creation will take many lives.


I can't allow that.
Then I have to stop it.
I have to make whatever sacrifices I can to keep Sakura from being burdened with more deaths.
Stop Angra Manyu.
I have to end the war before he emerges from the Holy Grail.

"I guess you understand now. We have to fight and win.
 And there are only two ways to do this.
 Kill Sakura, Angra Manyu's Master, before he comes out. Or destroy the Great Holy Grail before he comes out."

"...The former's the more certain method.
 Sakura and Zouken will surely get in our way if we try to destroy the Great Holy Grail. We won't be able to do it without defeating them.
 So it's easiest to defeat Sakura."

"Yeah. Fight Sakura and separate her from Angra Manyu. That's the easiest way, and the plan's easy to understand."
"Oh. You have no problem with going after her?"

"...That's the only thing we can manage right now. If Angra Manyu is what Ilya says it is, it's not something humans can match. We lose the instant it comes out.
 Then we have to take the quickest and surest route.
 More importantly, Tohsaka. I don't mind fighting, but do you know where Sakura is?"

"That's not a problem. If Ilya's right, there's only one place the Great Holy Grail can be. Right, Ilya?"

"...Yes, you're right, Rin.
 Angra Manyu is about to be born, so Zouken is at the Great Holy Grail.
 The degraded ley line. The origin that was chosen by the three families two hundred years ago. Angra Manyu is being conceived in the large cavern underneath the Ryudou Temple."

"Under the Ryudou Temple..."
...That's where Sakura is.
That's where we'll be heading, the place where the Holy Grail War will end.

"........."
I take a deep breath and allow my tense mind to relax slightly.
The cold pendant in my hand settles my thoughts.


Fighting Sakura.
Tohsaka isn't lying.
It's just that our methods are different.
Tohsaka must intend to finish the war by killing Sakura.
But I'll end the war by saving Sakura's life

".....!?"
My body trembles.
The house is beset by pressure, making the air feel like water.
And...
"Sakura!"
The instant we realize the pressure's coming from the shadow, we run out into the yard.
".........Oh well. I guess I'm saved."
I have to find out what happened to me before I start moving around.
I'm still conscious.
I can figure out the situation if I don't let my guard down.

"......So. Why am I here?"
I think about why I'm here in the shed.
Sakura's warning.
Sakura warned us to run, and Tohsaka said she'd fight.
Thenthat's right, we have to go beneath the Ryudou Temple.

"So... Why am I lying in the shed when we have to go to the Ryudou Temple?"
I'm on the ground.
I realize that I'm inside the shed.
My right hand is hurting.
Thanks to that, my consciousness is back.

"Damn. Pull yourself together, idiot."
I get up and check how my limbs are doing.
...Don't lose spirit.
I'm certainly losing something at hopeless speed.
But it's not fatal.
At the very least, I should be able to fight normally until the day dawns.

"You look terrible. Do you recognize me, Shirou?"

"!"
I quickly turn around.
...In the back of the shed...
Shrouded in darkness just beyond the moon's reach, there stands a Servant in black.

"Rider. You..."

"Yes. I was watching you.
 My mission is to protect you, but Sakura is my Master. So long as she is the one trying to harm you, I can offer you no assistance.
 That is why I did not help you in the forest. It was your own fault to be attacked by Berserker."

Rider explains lightly.
...She speaks without emotion.
It seems she was waiting for me to be alone.

"...I see. Then you came here to..."
"To kill you. You and your allies are Sakura's enemies. Thus, I cannot let you meet her."
Rider's holding a nail-like dagger.
...I feel her hostility creeping up my spine.

"!"
Rider's serious.
I
I can't be killed here.
It's two meters to the door.
I can get there in one step if I jump with all my strength.
The problem is that Rider can close the distance long before I get outside.

"......"
Rider emits hostility that can be taken as anger or dejection.
...It might be because the shed's dark, but she looks like a giant snake.

", "
I concentrate only on the signs of her attack...

", Hah!"
And I avoid the dagger that's swung at me before I jump back.

"I did it!"
I jump out into the yard.
The rush of dodging a superior opponent's attack and the joy of escaping makes my heart beat faster.

But that's enough pleasure for now.
The fight just began. I now have to beat Rider somehow

".........Huh?"
I don't feel anyone coming after me out of the shed.
Rider slowly appears from within.
"...I have lost interest. You cannot kill Sakura with your skill. There is no need for me to kill you here."
She disappears into the night.

"........."
Rider's presence disappears.
Maybe she's left the grounds.
I don't feel her hostility anymore, and I don't think she's coming back.

".........Rider."
Did she let me go?
If my suspicion is correct, she might help us if the opportunity arises
I have to use Archer's arm.
I can't match Rider.
I can't afford to use any more projection, but it's better to take chances if she's going to kill me...!

"Trace, on."
I activate my Magic Circuit, not daring to take my eyes off her.
...I won't make any weapons until the last second.
I'll project something and counter her the instant she attacks me!

"......Projection. I cannot use you to your full potential, but an excellent swordsman would be able to use you as a Noble Phantasm."

"?"
Rider's hostility dissipates.
Rider steps back and relaxes, as if she's read my mind.

"...Rider?"
"I will let you go. I cannot use you.
 ...How ironic fate can be. If Saber were here, she would have been your partner."

Rider's presence disappears.
Maybe she left the grounds after leaving the shed.
I don't feel her hostility anymore, and I don't think she's coming back.

"........."
Did she let me go?
If my suspicion is correct, she might help us if the opportunity arises

She once asked me...
What was it?
Remember.
It was...
...She asked me...
If I'll be able to fight until the very end.

"......Rider. I'll fight until the very end. I want to save Sakura, just like you want to protect her. I don't know what result it'll bring, but I can't run away.
 ...I'll fight Sakura to save her. If you're going to stand in my way, I'll do whatever it takes to kill you."
"........."

There's no reply.
After a long and heavy silence...

"I understand your determination. But you cannot save Sakura like that."
...She leaves with those words.

"Rider...?"
"You fight in your own way.  I will save Sakura in mine."

The voice comes from afar, and there's no indication she'll return.
...Rider goes into battle alone, without returning to her Master or relying on us.
...She asked me...
If I won't give up until the very end.

"......Rider. I'll fight until the very end. I want to save Sakura, just like you want to protect her. I don't know what result it'll bring, but I can't run away.
 ...I'll fight Sakura to save her. If you're going to stand in my way, I'll do whatever it takes to kill you."
"........."

There's no reply.
After a long and heavy silence...

"I understand your determination. But you cannot save Sakura like that."
...She leaves with those words.

"Rider...?"
"You fight in your own way.  I will save Sakura in mine."

The voice comes from afar, and there's no indication she'll return.
...Rider goes into battle alone, without returning to her Master or relying on us.
...That's right.
She asked me under the starry sky.
If I'll be on Sakura's side until the very end.

The words I couldn't say to her back then.
I can tell her now with confidence.

"Rider. I understand how much you care for Sakura.
 You're stopping me now because Sakura will suffer if you let me go, right?"

".........Yes. Are you still going to kill Sakura in spite of that?"
"I'm not going to kill her. I'm going to save her.
 Rider. I'm going to protect Sakura until the very end. I'm going to choose Sakura no matter what."

"Soplease lend me your power. Tohsaka and I can't do this alone. If you care for Sakura, please help us."

"Is that...
 Your answer to my question from the other day?"
I nod.

"............Very well.
 But I will not fight unless there is a chance to win. What do you expect of me, Shirou?"

What I expect from Rider?
There's only one thing.
Rider's the only one out of all the Servants that can oppose Saber's Noble Phantasm, Sakura's strongest card.

"I have some questions before that. Can you still use your Noble Phantasm?"
"Yes. Sakura still supplies me with magical energy."

"Right, next question. Are Servants still spirits even if they take physical form? So you can't hurt them with normal weapons?"

"...Let's see. A normal Servant will be able to nullify them, but those consumed by Sakura are another matter.
 Having received bodies from Sakura, they cannot return to spiritual form.
 Strong magical weapons should be able to penetrate through their shadows."

"I see, then it's decided. There's a chance of victory, and the roles are clear.
 Rider. I want you to beat Saber one-on-one. To be specific"

I whisper in her ear.
...I know nobody's listening, but I'm just making sure.

"I see. I can definitely penetrate her guard with that.
 It is a pure contest of power. Nothing is left to chance."
"Right? ...Well, if there is a problem..."

"It is your skill and my trust in you."

I nod.
Rider puts a finger to her mouth, thinking...
"Fair enough. I shall trust you and accept you as my temporary master."
...And agrees with a smile that takes me by surprise.
"...Do what you want. I don't know what your intentions are, but neither one of us likes Zouken."
"I see, common ground is important. I do have some relation to that old man."

We start down the hill.
We leave the church together without looking at each other.

Dawn has nearly broken when we reach the forest.
"Wait here. You may go home if we do not return by the time the date changes."
He stops the car on a road near the entrance of the forest.
Kotomine arranged for the car.

"So how are you going to help me?"
"Hm. Our method of transportation, to start out with."
...After that conversation, Kotomine immediately prepared a car and driver.
That alone is helpful.
It's past three in the morning. Not many taxis would take a suspicious student out to the outskirts right now.

"It is possible that only the boy will return.
 That is not a good situation. Do not wait for me and go back to town as fast as possible in that case."
Kotomine gives orders to the driver.
The driver nods silently, then opens the trunk.

"Emiya. Take the weapon."
"Huh?"
He throws a long, thin object at me.

"Whoa. Is this a sword?"
It's a slender sword.
It's like a rapier.
It's a sword made for thrusting, not slashing.
But the blade's a bit too thick, and it looks like it'll be hard to use.
It's like Assassin's Dark made into a sword.

"This is a weapon?"
"Kiritsugu preferred guns, but unfortunately, submachine guns are the only firearms I have right now. Bullets aren't effective against ghosts, and you're not trained to use them in any case. That's better for you, since you're a magic user."


I lightly swing the sword.
...It's oddly-balanced.
It weighs about a kilo, but the tip is heavy.
It's more like an arrow than a sword.

"...Is this a special weapon of the Church? I feel magical energy from it."
"It is called a Black Key. It is not magic, but sacrament.
 It is our exclusive right, used to fight spirits. If you use your magic on that sword, it should be of some use, even against a Servant."
That's if I can hit them with it, he adds.

"Make sure you do not get into a situation where you have to use it.
 Let's go.
 It's been almost a day since Ilyasviel was kidnapped.
 The place may be empty already, but we'll think about that after we get there.
 We should at least be able to find out where Matou Sakura went."
The priest, unlike me, goes into the forest empty-handed.


I take a deep breath.
I put the sword into the sheath and follow after Kotomine.

I take the lead.
I use my memory to head to the castle.
...I couldn't reach it the last time I was here.
It's because I met Ilya, fleeing from the black shadow, on my way to the castle.


...I check my left arm.
I lost my arm at that time.
I was almost killed by the shadow, and there wasn't a thing I could do about it.
It's the same now.
I have no way to match the shadow even if I encounter it, and they also have Saber.

...Once I run into them, it's all over.
If I'm to get Ilya back, a surprise attack will be the only way.
I'll rescue Ilya without Sakura noticing.
Then

What should I do after that?
What can I do to Sakura?
How can I take Sakura back to my house?

"Hold on. Do not tell me you intend to bring Matou Sakura back."
"Wha... O-Of course I intend to. I want to save her."

"Don't even try.
 We cannot match Matou Sakura... no, that shadow. It will swallow us without giving us a chance to talk. You should know that better than me."

"!"
That's...
It'll be just like when I confronted her in the yard.
But still

"Let it go this time. We will have our chance if we can put Ilyasviel under your care. If you wish to speak with Matou Sakura, that can come after we prepare something that can match her."
"............"

A force that can match Sakura, who has an overwhelming amount of magical energy.
...If anyone can prepare such a thing, it'll be Tohsaka.
I'll have to project the gem sword we were planning to use against Zouken and the black shadow

"Damn...! Okay, so I'm supposed to concentrate on saving Ilya for now, right...!?"
"Right. Then let's go. We don't have time."


I slap my cheeks to boost my spirits.
This isn't the time to be feeling timid.
I have to save Ilya.
Sakura said she'll kill her.
...I won't let her die, and I won't let Sakura do such a thing.
All I can do right now is to get Ilya away from Sakura.
Then I'll concentrate on that for now

I emerge in a familiar place.
It's been two hours since I entered the forest.
The sun should already be up, but the forest's still covered in morning mist.

"...She's here. The curse over this forest is definitely hers."
"...?"
Kotomine says something strange as we keep running.
...The curse over this forest?
Can he see such a thing?

"Kotomine. By curse, do you mean you can pick out Sakura's presence?"
"It is more like a resonance. ......Well, I do not care. But if we are to fight Matou Sakura, I will retreat.
 Putting you aside, I cannot harm Black Sakura. I have no chance of winning even if I fight her."
"......?"
Well, I have no chance of winning either. But...

"Hold on. What do you mean by 'Black'? Sakura's Sakura. She's just possessed by the shadow, and she'll quickly...."
"She'll quickly be back to normal?
 I explained that to you before. The only way to return her to normal is to separate her from the shadow."

"There are two ways to do so.
 Eliminate the main body of the shadow, or wait until Matou Sakura materializes it.
 You have no way to defeat the shadow right now. All you can do is protect Sakura's mind until the shadow is born."


But I don't know how to protect her mind.
...The Command Spell covering Sakura's body...
If that's what Kotomine means by Black Sakura, then isn't Sakura slowly turning into the shadow?

"...Kotomine. When you talk about materializing the shadow, do you mean Sakura turning into it?"
"No. I'm sure there is some sympathy, but the main body of the shadow is in the Holy Grail.
 What is transforming Matou Sakura is inside the Holy Grail, but that is still her shadow.
 It cannot exist without her. The main body does not have form, so it exists in the material world by being her shadow."

"What's inside the Holy Grail will not come into this world unless there is an incomplete Holy Grail called Matou Sakura.
 But once it is born, it will be a separate entity. Once it is separated from her, the curse tainting her should stop."

"...Kotomine. You say born, but is that thing inside Sakura?"
"Of course not. If it were, the matter would be easily solved. We would simply need to extract it from her body.
 The main body of the shadow is within the Holy Grail. Matou Sakura is merely a host that gives it energy and form."

"But Sakura's the Holy Grail, right? What does that mean?
 Are there many Holy Grails?"

"Yes. I explained to you in the beginning. This land has a Holy Grail, and they summon the Holy Grail into the Holy Grail the people prepared.
 The main Holy Grailthe magic circle and the brain that governs the rules of the ritual called the Holy Grail War. That is the Holy Grail on this land that Einzbern, Tohsaka, and Makiri prepared."

"The Holy Grail in this land"
All the laws... Summoning the Servants, making the Masters fight, and calling down the Holy Grail.
If the Holy Grail War is man-induced, then it's obvious that there's also a man-induced cause.

Thenif I find that large-scale magic circle and destroy it, I may be able to purge the shadow invading Sakura's body

"Do you know where that is, Kotomine?"
"I have a guess. Ask Rin if you would like to know the entrance.
 The Tohsaka family are the supervisors of this land.
 The Einzbern cooperated with them two hundred years ago to secure a land for the ritual. Rin, the successor, should know where the place is."

"Butthat is all after we save Ilyasviel. If Zouken obtains Ilyasviel, she and Matou Sakura will be disposed of as the Holy Grail.
 Matou Zouken has no intention of using the main Holy Grail. For him, the two women are enough.
 Your idea of destroying the main Holy Grail is meaningless."

"D-Don't be stupid! I'm not thinking about such a thing!"
"Really? I think it is the most realistic solution for you. It's strange that you wouldn't go through with it."

"Shut up. So why didn't you tell me about it?
 If you'd told me at the beginning, I would...."

"You would have destroyed the magic circle? Nothing would go so smoothly. My goal is the completion of the magic circle, after all. I cannot let you destroy it."

"I told you that we will be enemies after we rescue Ilyasviel. My goal is different from yours.
 I am interested in what comes from Matou Sakurano, what is trying to become her. Unlike Zouken, I have no wish."

"...Don't bullshit me. You're the same as Zouken. You're using Sakura to create something and make it yours."

"Make it mine...? Of course not. I have no interest in it after it is born. In any case, no human will be able to control it.
 What will appear is a phenomenon called hell. If Matou Sakura becomes that, I will die just like everybody else."

"Wha"
What is that?
Then his goal's just...

"Are you insane?
 You want to turn Sakura into such a thing, knowing that you're going to be killed...!?"

"Yes. My role is to bless whatever is born.
 That will not change, no matter what it is or what situation it is in.
 There is a life and a will to be born. I cannot oppose that.
 Emiya. If there is a pure wish in this world, it must be the desire to be born."

"But what's in Sakura is"
"It is not evil.
 Humans can earn happiness just by existing.
 As they grow, they will learn of new happiness, of more advanced and complex pleasures."

"But humans are not happy at the moment of birth.
 An embryo does not have the knowledge to know what happiness is.
 Humans start from zero, learn what is fun, and learn what is right.
 The beginning is at zero.
 There is no good or evil. There is only the fact that it is allowed to exist in this world."


"Good or evil. The person's knowledge will decide that.
 If there is any responsibility, it lies with the environment and the 'self' that raised you.
 There is no crime in receiving birth.
 That is why I will bless even the birth of a devil."

"This is the way I have lived.
 This way of living is mine.
 Even if what Matou Sakura gives birth to is hell, it is hard to change my nature."


...I don't understand.
I know he's serious.
He knows he'll die, but he's still going bless the evil that will be born through Sakura.
...I'll never be able to approve of this man.
But it's true that he's trying to save Ilya and release Sakura from Zouken's control.

"!"
Thoughts that are in conflict.
Lives that cannot coexist.
But we have the same goal right now.

"I can trust you, right?"
"I said we will be cooperating. I will trust you with my back."

A reply without hesitation.
...That's all that's there right now.
I have an ally that's better than anyone.
I'll just think about rescuing Ilya and getting out of this forest safely
AhAh, ahah

The space is filled with black fire.
The luxurious rooms are burned away by meaningless gasping.

   AhAh, ahah

The blazing fire is like a heat haze.
The formerly shapeless shadow breaks through every wall and floor in concert with the host's pain.

   Hauh, ahahh, ah!

The black heat haze dances in tune to the melody.
Each time the figure at its center curls up, claws at her throat, and gasps in agony, the old castle's beauty is disfigured further.
But this is nothing to grieve over.
This desolate winter castle has been forgotten by everyone.
Nobody has lived here or seen it, so it makes no difference even if it's destroyed.

   "Ah...... Ua... ah... aaahh, ah......"

The hall has turned into the shadow's kingdom.
Writhing in agony, the woman in the middle is both its king and its slave.
It has already been a day since she arrived at this castle with Ilyasviel.

Matou Sakura's transfiguration is reaching its final stage.

As she's one with the shadow, having a physical form is torture.
Her mind is being engulfed by pain and the impulse to destroy.
...If that were all, she would be able to bear it.
She's used to physical pain.

Butthe pain of having her existence denied is something she has never experienced.
The shadow should not exist.
This world has no blessings to offer it.

   "Uh...... Ah... ah... ah......!"

She tears at her throat.
She cannot breathe.
The air is poisonous.
Matou Sakura is turning into a deep-sea monster, so being on land is like being in a vacuum.

  "AhAhhh, ahhhh......!!!!"

That's why she dances around like mad.
Her sanity broken, she takes out her anger on everything she sees.
She keeps appealing to the unconcerned world about her pain.
About her misfortune and her pain.

"Well. It is about time. She remained Matou Sakura for longer than I expected, but she will turn into the vessel with one more push."
Two shadows watch the spectacle.
An old magus, Matou Zouken, and his Servant, Assassin.

"...One more push? I am tired of hearing those words. The match is over. I am the only Servant you need. Have her take in the remaining two."
"I know. But she does not try to kill the Servants she has absorbed. I do not know if it is her shallow wit or cowardice. Saber and Berserker are still trapped within her. She should kill them, but she keeps them alive."

"...Interesting. So Saber is not the only one?"
"No. It is probably to keep me in check, but how thoughtless of her. The more Servants she controls, the more magical energy she must draw from the Holy Grail. It is a supply of magical energy the Holy Grail receives from the Great Holy Grail, but magical energy is not the only thing that flows into her.
 She is accelerating her transfiguration by letting the Servants live. Her sanity will be lost and she will turn into an ideal tool even if I do nothing."

The old magus laughs, watching the girl's suffering.
There's affection in his eyes.
He loves her.
What he originally considered a mere experiment grew beyond his expectation to grant him his dearest wish, immortality.

It would be strange not to love her.
To the old magus, Matou Sakura looks like a beautiful bride.
No matter how much she fights, she will be his in the end.
It doesn't matter even if she obtains power, controls many Servants, and retains her sanity.
Their hierarchy was set eleven years ago.
The old magus can kill Matou Sakura merely by closing his eyes and opening them again.


...But the white skull is different.
He's the symbol of ill omen, the wind that brings death, so he's sensitive to those of his kind.

"The magus makes light of the matter, but"
Will everything turn out well?
The situation will not change, even if the girl loses her sanity.
She reacts to people with hostility.

In that regard, she's already acting the way she will once her mind is lost.
Matou Zouken is conceited.
Even if she goes mad, she will not obey his command.

"......Magus. There is a way to control her, yes? Her defensive instincts are excessive. Your voice will not reach her if she loses her sanity and can no longer tell ally from enemy.
 If that happens, you cannot approach merely by hiding your hostility.
 She is the kind that will eliminate her enemies by foreseeing the 'result' called her death."

"Oh, I see, that is promising. That makes it even better as the container."
The old magus laughs.


Falling silent, the masked figure stares at the crumbling hall.
...He cannot approve of the magus's plan.
He says his goal is immortality, but his method seems distorted.
No, he's a rotting human from the start.
It's natural that he's crazy, but the old man's procedure seems inconsistent

"Haha, did you hear that, Assassin!? She's begging me for help now! Good, good! It feels like we're eleven years in the past!
 The pressure of being denied by the world itself must surely be painful, Sakura!
 But endure it. Your body can endure it. Remember all the days of pain and solitude over the last eleven years!
 For what did you bear the thousands of tortures!?  What did you give your body to the tens of thousands of worms for!? That's right; pain of that degree is nothing to you! That's how I raised you! That's how I trained you!"

"........."
It seems the old magus can hear the girl's voice.
Assassin can only hear groans, but she must literally be begging for her life, begging for help.

"Yes, I will help you! You are my masterpiece! I shall see it through! But I can only save your body. Your mind did not follow me through the eleven years of training.
 You escaped the pain by accepting it, so you should not be able to bear that resentment. But you can rest assured, as I will guarantee the strength of your flesh! You can bear it! Your flesh shall put on Avenger!"

The old magus continues to laugh.
Assassin looks at him emotionlessly and steps back.

"Hm? Where are you going, Assassin?
 There is a slight possibility of danger. I need you here to protect me from her."
"...I do not mind, but why are you concerned about the black Holy Grail and not the white? Why are you letting the legitimate Holy Grail we obtained roam freely?"
"Oh, that. Ilyasviel is cooperative. She exists only to open the gate, as is her duty. She does not mind what we do as long as her goal is achieved."

"........."
"Do not be so doubtful. The Holy Grail you desire is that girl. Keeping your name in history and becoming the original. Your wish to be eternal through record will be granted by Einzbern.
 But I need her to keep her original form. Homunculi are outside my expertise. You can let her be until they prepare her formal dress."

".........So you will not force them, you say?
 Butdo we have such liberty?"
"Of course we do. We have no more enemies.
 It was unexpected that Emiya's boy and Tohsaka's girl were alive, but they aren't important. Nobody is foolish enough to fight after being shown that much difference in power."

"We cannot take it back if we rush things out of needless worry and allow Ilyasviel to die.
 It is her role to open heaven's gate. We shall show compassion and let her carry out her dutyAssassin?"
"Stop. It seems there is someone that foolish."
"Hm?"

At that instant, the white skull disappears.
Assassin sensed the intruders and hurried out of the castle without hesitation.
The enemies are already running outside.
They have slipped through the unwary magus's guard and are about to exit the castle gate.

"Oh. So you are determined to die, boy?"
But he hasn't been careless.
Ilyasviel cannot run away.
Einzbern's longstanding desire is in her core.
The white girl will help him even if he doesn't force her.
It's foolish to run away with such a girl.
Even if they escape the forest with her, she will come to the land of the Holy Grail, the land of the origin.

"Hah. I have left her alone, but it cannot be helped now.
 It is your turn, Sakura. You cannot be saved without Ilyasviel. If you would like to be freed from that pain, go trample upon them without mercy."
With a loud laugh, the presence of the old magus recedes.

...A shadow is cowering in the hall.
The shadow that shrouds the entire hall has become a black swamp, from which two dark figures emerge.

   "....................."

The girl no longer feels agony.
It's not that she's accustomed to the poison now.
It's merely that...
"............I see. You came, Senpai......"

...Pleasure has surpassed her dark pain.

"...So that priest's with him. How stupid of him. He came to be eaten?"
She raises a finger.
To the direction of the castle gate. The direction the trespassers have gone, where they are running even now.

"Go. You can kill anyone but Senpai. Kill anyone else, no matter who they may be."

The black giant is released.
The unleashed hound roars and disappears with a sudden gust.

"But thenyou won't be able to tell who that is, though, Berserker."

She smiles.
Slowly, she leaves the kingdom of rubble with the black swordsman.
We go out into the yard.
The whole world is covered by the shadow.
My entire body is numb with fear.

...The black shadow is standing in front of us.
It can crush this house if it wants to.
The difference in our power is obvious.
It has transfigured to an existence that's unlike anything I've ever seen.

"..............."
...The black shadow does nothing.
It's not Sakura, but a shadow shaped like her.
The real Sakura is under the Ryudou Temple.
The thing in front of us is a virtual image.

"Hmph. So you're sending the shadow instead of showing up yourself? You've gotten arrogant during the short time you've been away."
"........."
Does she not hear Tohsaka's provocation, or does she not hear anything at all?
Wavering in the moonlight, her shadow looks lonely.

"........."
Her eyes look at me.
'Senpai'.
Weak, as if she'll reply like always if I just reach out.


But I don't.
What I must do is determined.
I can't say anything to her, as doing so would weaken my resolve.

She looks away.
After hanging her head for a moment, "Did you hear the whole story from Ilyasviel, Nee-san?"
She confronts Tohsaka with a cold voice.

"Yeah. I heard about what's possessing you and the abilities of what's about to be born from the Holy Grail.
So, Sakura. Let me ask. Do you have any intention of cutting ties with Angra Manyu?"
Tohsaka's voice is the same.
Completely cold, showing no concern for Sakura.

"No. I said the weak me disappeared, didn't I? I was able to obtain this power, so I don't intend to let it go.  I couldn't even if I wanted to.
 ...This is how Matou Sakura has to live from now on."

"I see. Then one more thing.
 How complete is the Servant you're boasting about? Ilya said it's coming out soon, but what do you have to say as the mother? Is it already born?"

"...Of course not. When that happens, this town will be consumed in a second.
 I can't allow that yet. Senpai's still here.
 So I won't let him out as long as I still exist."

"Oh, so there's no reason for us to hurry, huh? So you're going to keep Angra Manyu inside as long as Shirou's with me?
 That's good, Shirou. Sakura seems well enough."

"...Don't be ridiculous. You should know how much longer I'm going to last.
 Please run away with Senpai. I won't last long. I don't know when I'll disappear. I might only be able to hold out for one night."

"So I'm warning you before that.
 ...Nee-san. Please take Senpai and run far away. Then I can be at peace and take his life with mine."

Sakura says she's going to kill him using her life.
Tohsaka trembles a bit.
Is that because she believes her, or...

"...Humph. You don't know when you're going to disappear, huh?
 You're wrong. You just don't know when you'll run out of patience."
"Nee-san."

"Oh well. I don't know how you're going to kill Angra Manyu, but you can kill yourself without hesitation if I run away with Shirou?
 You'll kill the Servant within the Holy Grail along with you, right?"

"...Y-Yes. So please run away.
 I-I don't want you to see me change. It's fine as long as Senpai gets away.
 Soplease don't come after me anymore, Senpai."

She's desperately begging us.
Sakura's shadow can kill us right now, but it asks for salvation by letting us go.


But I can't answer her wish.
I can't leave Sakura and run away, nor can I let her kill herself along with Angra Manyu.
And...
"We'll go there. We'll go and kill you for sure."
Tohsaka breaks away from her sister.

"Wha"
"What did you expect? As Tohsaka's magus, I can't ignore you. And I can't believe you even if you say you'll kill yourself.
 Don't you get it, Sakura? You're not making any sense. You want to kill, but you're telling me to run.
 Geez, you're trying to act like a good girl because you're in front of Shirou."

"...What?"
"Oh, you can make a good face. That's what you should've done from the start.
 So, is that all? Then get lost. You don't have to hurry since we'll go see you right away.
 Look, Sakura. I'll kill you with my own hands."

Tohsaka declares with voice that even contains kindness.
...The shadow wavers.
After freezing on the spot like a statue...
"YesI'll be waiting for you, Nee-san."
...It smiles violently and disappears.

The shadow covering the house recedes.
Tohsaka and I are the only ones remaining in the yard.

I get dizzy.
I thought I was concentrating, but it seems I was agitated after seeing Sakura's image.
...It seems Sakura's not the only one that's running out of time.

"Shirou.
 You heard what Sakura said. But what're you going to do?
 If you want to run, I won't stop you. But if you do, that'll be after you project the gem sword."

"You don't have to confirm with me. I won't run away, and I'll somehow project the gem sword.
 We're cooperating, right? Then I'll follow up by doing things you can't do."

"...I see. That's good, but do you understand, Shirou?
 Coming with me means killing Sakura. The same goes for the gem sword. You're going to prepare a weapon that I will use to kill her."

"...Yeah. The gem sword thing is contradictory. But Sakura's out of our control, and projecting the sword is a promise we made. If projecting the sword means we can match Sakura's shadow, then it's something we definitely need to do."

"Oh. So..."
"Yeah, I'm taking the opposite measure. I'm going to end this war by saving Sakura. I've decided to be Sakura's ally."

"Even if letting Sakura live means killing everyone else?"
"We don't know that yet. There should be a way to save Sakura and not let there be any more victims."

"...I don't know about that. Sakura's already killed many people. Is it justice for you to save such a person, Shirou?"
Her inquiry is decisive.
A sin I can't talk myself out of.
She puts it into words, and I finally...

"That's right. I'll protect her even if she's not human. I'm going to protect her from everything, including the part of her that wants to kill me.
 That's all I want to do. That's what it means to be someone's ally, right?"
...I'm able to tell her what I think.

"......Geez. You really can just come out and say it."
I nod back, feeling no shame.

"......I see. Well, I knew there was no point in arguing with you, but I didn't think it'd go this far. You beat me."
"Huh? Where are you going, Tohsaka?"

"I have to go prepare for the battle.
 Sakura gave us that warning because she really doesn't have time to spare. So I have to get ready quickly."
"That's true, but we were talking"

"We're done talking now. In short, you're going to save Sakura as long as you're still alive, right?
 ...Hmph. Fine, do as you want. I'm not going to say anything now. Go struggle to your heart's content."

"Hm...?"
Where did her nervousness go? Tohsaka looks angry now.

"But don't get me wrong. This is in exchange for making the gem sword.
 I'll leave you in charge of Sakura as long as you're trying. I won't do anything until you can't move anymore.
 ...That's good, right? You might be able to save Sakura, if you try hard enough."

Tohsaka leaves with that.
"........."
The uneasiness in my chest goes away.
We're thinking oppositely.
But Tohsaka still wants to save Sakura.

Then I can entrust her with Sakura.
We both like her.
Then Tohsaka should be able to save Sakura.
It's ten o'clock.
Tohsaka said we'll prepare for battle and go to the Ryudou Temple before the date changes.

"Well. I'm going to have you project the gem sword, but how do you feel? Can you project it while suppressing Archer's arm?"
"Oh"
...I see.
Ilya hasn't told her how I took the Shroud off.
"Wellum, yeah..."

"Oh, that's good to hear. Then the rest is up to Shirou and Ilya.
 The Azoth Sword, which is as close as we're going to get to the gem sword, Shirou's projection, and Ilya's support. We may not be able to replicate it, but if all goes well, we should at least be able to reproduce half of its original ability."
Tohsaka hands me a dagger.

"........."
The dagger is a ritualistic equipment.
It might be something she favors, as it looks well-used.
Not only that. Even an amateur like me can feel how much magical energy is stored in this thing.

...Well, this is nothing compared to the shadow, but it's still a hundred times more than my magical energy capacity.

"...This is amazing. You had something like this up your sleeve?"
"Of course it's amazing. I used all the jewels I had, which contained ten years worth of magical energy."

Tohsaka sulks, like she didn't want to use them.
...She seems generous, but maybe she's really stingy when it comes to money.
Well, with that aside...

"Hmm, but is that really okay, Tohsaka? You don't have any left for yourself if you've used everything you have, right? I know you're still not fully recovered, so can you still fight?"

"Well, I can manage to move around. But I haven't healed to the point where I can use magic again."
"Waitthen..."

"You don't need to worry. It's fine as long as you can project the gem sword. The sword has absurd powers said to have even stopped the 'falling moon'."

"...?"
I don't get what she means, but Tohsaka has great confidence.
...Well, if she's so sure of herself, I won't worry either.

"Let's start, Shirou. It'll take a long time to project that sword, even for you. We have to get started or the date'll change."

"You're right. Then let's go back to your room. If we're not someplace where you can relax, our chances are lower."
Tohsaka heads back to the living room.

"Oh, hold on. I'll do the projection in the shed.
 And I want to be alone with Ilya while I do it, so can you wait in your room?"
"Why? I have to be there in case something happens, right?"

"There's no need. It's a bother if you're here.
 Shirou gets distracted easily, so we might fail if you fall and get his attention when it counts the most."

"...Hey, that's rude, Ilya."
Tohsaka complains with a sour look.
She's not arguing back, maybe because she can't deny the possibility that she'll screw up at a crucial moment.

"...All right. Then I'll wait outside the shed. Is that all right, Ilya?"
"...I guess it can't be helped. That's the biggest compromise we can make."

"Rin. Don't come in until I tell you to if you want us to reproduce the gem sword. I'll call for you if something's about to happen, so please stay outside until then no matter what."

"You're being persistent. I said I understand. I won't come in even if I hear Shirou scream."
"........."
It doesn't really matter, but I wish she'd picked a better example.

"Well, let's go, Shirou."
Ilya goes into the shed.
I decide to ask Tohsaka something before I follow.

"Tohsaka. Can I have this sword?"
"...? You're going to be projecting using that. The Azoth Sword will go away once the gem sword's projected."

"Yeah. You can have the gem sword, so can I have this in return?
 See, this might break if I fail. I can't concentrate, thinking how you might get angry if I break this."

"...Geez. Fine. You can have the Azoth Sword if that'll help you relax."
"Thanks. Then I'm going to go do my best."

...I shut the door.
I can't let Tohsaka see this.
I'm sure she won't stop me now, but she'll definitely feel responsible.
If I'm to smooth this out, I have to tell her I used it after everything is over and get retroactive approval.

"...Are you ready, Shirou? You've released Archer's arm already, so I don't need to explain the steps, right?"
I nod.
Ilya tells me to sit down, and I do so.

"But Ilya. I can only project what I've seen or what Archer made. I have no information on the gem sword. I can't project it even if we have a blueprint and a dagger that's just like it."

"I know. I'll first have you come inside my memory. I haven't seen it either, but the record of the gem sword is in me.
 Tohsaka's great master was there when the Great Holy Grail was made.
 I'm sure the sword was there at that time."

"Whoa, Ilya"
"Just close your eyes. I'll keep your body here and send your mind somewhere else. We did this before. I'll send your vision into my memory, so analyze the gem sword there.
 ...I'll release your left arm once you're inside. You'll be hit by the pressure of two hundred years and the invasion from your arm at the same time. Brace yourself and try to finish the projection as fast as you can."


Ilya's voice is trembling.
...Her arms are as well.

"...I'll take you to the gem sword, so you just need to hold your breath. Clear your mind and don't look at anything unnecessary. You just need to draw out his Zelretch"

Space splits.
Is it because all my senses are within her memory...
or is it because my left arm is released?

There's no pain, the cognition of pain doesn't matter now, I'm swallowed by my injury, I'm falling into a swirling maelstrom of pain.

I don't know where I am.

       I don't know who I am.

          I don't know what it means.

It's a large circuit.
Multi-layered Crests are carved on a bare rock that's over fifty meters in radius.
It's like a large observatory, rotating by itself in the deserts of Arizona.

The circuits cover the area in many layers.
The geometric figures turn in place.
A white girl stands in the center of the beautiful spider's nest.

Her name is Lizleihi.
Lizleihi Justizia von Einzbern.
She's the magus that devised the Holy Grail War.
The great magus who was called the winter saint. A magus accompanied by Makiri Zouken and Tohsaka Nagato.

The Great Holy Grail is activated.
Justizia becomes the key reenacting the ancient sorcery.
Yes. The Holy Grail is just a Holy Grail without her.
Her will is needed for Heavens Feel.
The old man knows as well as Makiri and Tohsaka do that the Holy Grail is a mere wishbringer.

My vision narrows.
The world expands.
I concentrated on something needless. I did, so my body was ripped in half.

The world is too big for this small body.
I'll eventually see nothing.
The process behind this two-hundred-year-old ritual doesn't matter.
There's only one thing I need to look at.
I concentrate on the man standing in front of the Great Holy Grail. I concentrate on the dagger in his hand

That's the original.
A ritual dagger with a jeweled blade.
The kaleidoscopic gleam sears through my eyes and into my brain.

", "

I understand the instant I see it.
I understand that I can't comprehend it.
All I can imitate is its shape.
I can't analyze its structure and project it.

What kind of a magical theory was it constructed with?
The old man's dagger is still a mystery, even if I use Archer's arm and every last piece of knowledge in heroic spirit Emiya.
It's alien technology.
The old man is embodying general knowledge from a far future, beyond the reach of modern man

". ......!!"

I'm repelled.
I can't be repelled.
I can't reach it.
Not reaching it is unforgivable.

I reach out.
I reach out.
I reach out.
My eyes are burned out, my brains are burned out.
I extend my left arm for dozens of meters, extend, extend, extend

"Stop! Come back, Shirou...!"

I hear Ilya's voice.
But I'm not there yet.
I don't even have my fingertips on it.
I can't back out now.
How can I back out after seeing that miracle, the ultimate one...!?

"Give up...! Do you want to disappear, Shirou!?"

Get there

Get there

Get there

Get there



"Haa, ah.......!!!!!!!!"
"Shirou!"
Did I jump myself, or was I pushed back by something?
I'm flying, and I land on my back.

"Haga, ah!"
My left arm      pain              .
My tongue       my fingers             the trembling won't                   .
"Ahuwa, ah, ah!"
                             .
                   ,               .

"Stay     ! I'll         Shroud          !"
"Haa, guh, ah..........!"
A big knife stabs me from the side.
It's so uncomfortable that I repel the one wielding it

"Oh... Ouch"
And I realize I just punched Ilya.
"......! I-I'm sorry, Ilya, I"
She pats dust off herself and gets up.
...Good. She's not hurt.

"I told you not to look at unnecessary things, you idiot!
 ...Geez, I'll let you off the hook this time since it paid off, but I won't forgive you if you disobey me again!"

She points at my face as she scolds me.
...Wait.
Feeling something hard in my left hand, I look down.


......I managed to project it.
It's projected, but it doesn't seem like the one I saw.
First of all, I don't feel any magical energy in this thing.
Tohsaka's Azoth Sword is many times better than this, and this blade wouldn't cut paper.

"Yup. I have a lot to complain about, but thanks for your hard work, Shirou. Your projection was perfect. You showed me a flawless blade works."
"UhI don't know, but is this any good? It looks pretty crappy."

"That's fine as is. The sword is an extraordinary demonic sword that can only be used by Schweinorg's lineage.
 Well, I guess it's fate. Sakura is receiving the protection of the third and Rin's going to try to use the second. It wouldn't end up as mere investigation if the Association were here. Every department would be running to put them on trial."
Ilya laughs.

"...Wow. So this dagger is that amazing?"
"Yeah. To be more accurate, it's a multi-dimensional refractory phenomenon, Gem Sword Kishua Zelretch Schweinorg.
 It's called Gem Sword Zelretch, and it's the old magus's favored sword and Tohsaka's heirloom."

"But the sword wasn't passed down the Tohsaka line, just the blueprint.
 It's an assignment from the sorcerer that the Tohsaka magi must pursue for a long, long time."

"Assignment from a sorcerer... Wait, the great master Tohsaka was talking about is a sorcerer...!?"

"Yeah. But Zelretch is an oddball among the sorcerers in that he still associates himself with this world, so I'm sure he has other apprentices.
 I don't think Zelretch is in this world, but he might show up once Rin's capable of making the gem sword by herself."

"Hmm......?"
He's not in this world, but might appear all of a sudden? Isn't he just a wanderer that likes to travel?


Whoa.
I let my guard down.
I get dizzy.
I clench my right fist, feel the pendant digging into my torn flesh, and keep my consciousness.

", "
I steady my breathing so Ilya doesn't notice.
My limbsI still feel my limbs.


......Good.
I thought I'd lose something if I used projection, but I'm not missing anything yet.
My head's still working.
The biggest proof is that I can check on my condition.
I should be able to use one more projection.

No, I have to use it.
I have to save Sakura in a way different from Tohsaka.
Archer's arm will make it poss-

"So             means. In short, the sorcery                parallel worlds. So his nickname            Kaleidoscope             "
"Tohsaka?"
"   ?      ,                   ?"


I can't understand her.
It's not that I can't hear her. She's just speaking in a language I don't understand.
She's talking in some strange language and holding something dangerous in her left hand.

...Tohsaka's holding a sword I've never seen before.
Never seen before?
That can't be.
I projected (I think) that sword just now, and my left hand is empty, so it must mean I handed it to Tohsaka.

"Shirou?        from            .
 Was the projection               ?"


I get a chill.
My memory's vague.
I can't recall anything.
My understanding and the details don't match up.

"Guh, ..........!"
I clench my right hand.
My eyes finally focus in exchange for dripping blood.

"Um, Tohsaka."
I get up.
My limbs are light compared to my disconnected head.
They're so light that I think they may be empty inside.

"It's not 'Tohsaka'. Ilya and I will go test it out, so you should restwait, what's with your hand...!"

Tohsaka grabs me.
Her speed is surprisingly slow, but...
"Eh......? Why do you have this...?"
My mind isn't working, and she has ahold of my hand before I know it.

Tohsaka's looking at the pendant in my palm with astonishment.
I don't know why she's surprised.
But I have this because...

"Shirou. Why do you have this? And are you crazy, holding it this tight?"
"Why? I just have it as a charm. This is..."

...Something I picked up.
Why did I pick it up?
It's something I shouldn't forget, but I can't remember.
But the stranger in my left arm knows what it is better than I do.

"......Um, it's something important. I have to have it on me until the end."

Words that are not mine come out of my mouth.
".........
 Shirou. I also have that pendant."

"Eh?"
Tohsaka takes out a pendant from her pocket.
It's certainly the same.
It's a simple design for a jewel user like Tohsaka, but I think something simple like this brings out her beauty.

"Wow, they're the same."
I nod back.

"No. Mine's empty, but there's still a bit left in yours. It's not significant, but I'm sure there's a meaning behind the usage of it."
"...?"

"Keep that. It might come in handy."
Tohsaka puts her pendant away and walks off with Ilya.

"Hey, Tohsaka. Where are you going?"
"I need to talk to Ilya. I'll let you rest for an hour, so stay in your room.
 And I'll get seriously mad if you don't treat your hand right away."


Tohsaka's bad temper borders on outright hostility.
She takes Ilya, who follows her without a word.
The clock strikes midnight.
It's twelve o'clock, the promised time.

I wrap the Azoth sword with cloth and tuck it under my arm.
This is my only weapon. The only other thing I'm taking is the pendant.

"Shirou, Rin's calling for you. She's waiting outside, so she wants to meet up there as soon as you're ready."
Ilya's going to stay here.
It's partly because Zouken's after her, but I'm also having her stay here because she's my hope.

"I see. So she's out there, huh?"
"Yeah. She looked like she wanted you to come quickly, so she'll probably scold you again if you don't hurry."


I nod and get up.
There's no pain in my left arm now.
It's just that my human functionality is eroding.

I can't tell what I'm doing if I stand still.

"Then I'm going. Be careful, Ilya."
"See you, Shirou. Please come home with Sakura and Rin before the day breaks."
I wave goodbye to her and leave.

The house is dead quiet.
Ten years.
Many things happened here, and I have a lot of memories.
This just happened recently.
A morning scene that was part of my life for a year and a half.

The shed is dead quiet.
It's my small workshop that I frequented like my room.
Here I trained hard every night, hoping to be like Kiritsugu.
She'd wake me up from time to time when I slept in.
It feels like it happened long ago, but I even remember how the air smelled.

The room is dead quiet.
A room that was only used for the past couple days.
I don't have many memories here.
Only Sakura comes to mind.

"Man."
I sigh and lean against the wall.
I can't remember.
I can't remember what happened in this house or all the things I did.
But still.
Sakura's face comes to my mind just by walking to these places.

"Wow. I..."
...She really means a lot to me.
My consciousness is fading, and my memory is a mess.
The ten years in this house are ambiguous in my head.

ButI can still remember.
I can clearly remember Sakura, no matter what part of me goes away.


I take a deep breath.
What must be done has been determined from the start.

"All rightlet's go, Sakura."
Taking a firm grip on my consciousness, I leave Sakura's room.

There's nothing left.
We once made a promise here.
We knew it wouldn't come true, but we encouraged each other.

I'll do it again now.
What was that small hope used for?
You...

COWARD!!!!!
Rejected! Quickly go back to the previous choice and redo it!
I never raised you to be such a coward!

That's right!
Quickly come rescue me!

Exactly! The main story's reaching its final stage.  Nonstop development awaits you.

There are only four more Tiger Dojos.
If you came this far, run to the ending without dying.

Osu, you are exactly right!
I feel a bit lonely, but you won't make it ahead unless you're that determined!

Yes, well said, pupil number one!
Well, I wish you luck!
Oh, he died.

Osu. Excessive bleeding and falling to his death. There's no hope of survival.

I don't think I even need to say it, but the cause of this death is because you went against them by yourself.

If there's a chance to join hands with someone, go ahead and do it for a better result.

What? Then it's also good to join hands with people like Caster and Shinji?

Hm. No, consider their personalities.
First of all, you don't even get those choices.

What a failure. I wanted to see a route where Shirou and Shinji cooperate, or where you join hands with Caster.

Kiii! Don't talk about the rejected routes! Time and resources aren't infinite!

It's the spirit of the cook to put the most effort into the tastiest part!

Okay, I'll leave it at that.
So, you just have to join hands with Kotomine?

...Hmm, I guess so.
I understand not wanting to cooperate with that priest, but throw away your personal feelings and fight together.

Osu, I understand!
Yesterday's foe is today's friend! It's a common turn of events in a manga!

Yup! Everyone's part of the family! It's a good phrase! Use it!

That's right! Take full advantage of him and throw him away once you're done!

Hey there, don't talk too honestly.
This is one end. You've fought well. *Sob*

Huh? Aren't you going to get mad like always and call him a wimp?

This end is peaceful in a way.
It's like Saber-chan's end in "Heavens Feel".

Oh. ...Well, Shirou did win against Saber in a one-on-one fight, so I guess he's satisfied.

Yup.
But we'll carry out this dojo like always.
So, why did we reach this end, pupil number one!?

It's simple! I think it's because you fought Saber one-on-one! Osu!

That's right! I tell you every time to prepare a trump card when going into the final battle, so why don't you do your best!?

Master, then what's the trump card this time?

An ally!

Anally? That sounds really funny, master!

Stop with the jokes!

To be frank, you need a partner!
Even in this situation, there should be one Servant who might cooperate with you!

Convince her somehow before you go into your final battle!

Okay... But master, she quickly runs away.

Recall the conversation you had with her before. There's only one answer. She'll become your ally if you give her the answer she wants.

Well, this dojo is over.

The long battle is about to reach the grand finale!
Please check out the grand finale of "Fate/stay night" with your own eyes!

Bye! Let's meet again in some other Tiger Dojo!

It's an altar enshrining the stars.

The fire blazes up as if to connect the heaven and the earth.
The flickering fire illuminates the dark cave, and singes the surrounding dome.
But this can't be a proper enshrinement.
It's said to connect to the sky, but the heavens are still underground.
And the shining light isn't red, but black.
The air's impure, the wind's stagnant, and the drops of water on the walls are colored like poison.

The underground kingdom that's said to be the dragon's lair actually looks like the dragon's stomach.
No human would come here.
The only ones to come and honor this alien world are serpents fleeing from the light.

"Guh"
A white skull coughs in this alien world.
The one tinted by dark red light is the one who lost his Master, the Servant Assassin.

"This is the end. I cannot maintain my body without a supply of magical energy."
The white skull creeps across the wall.
A girl stands before him.
Swathed in a black curse, she blankly stares at the oncoming figure.

"I finally made it.
 Magus. I cannot see you, but are you still alive?"
He stops five meters in front of the girl.
Sticking to the wall like a spider, Assassin speaks into empty space.

"Yes. Glad you could make it back, Assassin."
And the call reaches him.
The voice of the old magus echoes through the empty chamber.
The old man who was killed by Kotomine Kirei still lives in this underground kingdom.

It's natural.
The one killed in the forest was just a collection of worms.
The main body of the old magus, the host that contains his soul, is sleeping in the safest place on earth.
Even the priest's holy words cannot kill him unless the main body is destroyed.

"But having my limbs destroyed got me. I cannot make magical energy to send to you. And it is too much of a bother to go find a new body above ground.
 ...Hm, this will burden her, but it is about time. Sakura, make a contract with Assassin. You need a new bodyguard now that Berserker is defeated."

The voice echoes.
The girl clad in black curseMatou Sakura doesn't answer.
Ignoring the one who has absolute control over her, she looks off blankly into space.

"...What are you doing, Sakura? Are you disobeying me?"
The irritated voice also contains danger.
The old man is irritated.
He's angry that she lost Ilyasviel and Berserker.

"Sakura. I will ask you one more time. Are you going to defy me?"
Cold scorn.
The girl has never disobeyed this voice.
It's not fear, but submission to his absolute controlling power.
The girl does fear the old man.
Moreover, the girl cannot disobey him.
Because her heart is...

"Hold, magus. Perhaps there is no intelligence left in her. She has such a great power within her; it's not something a weak girl can withstand."
"Hm?"
His irritation disappears.
...A gentle silence.
The sounds of worms crawling fills the hell lit by black flame.

"Hm. It seems that way. I thought she would last a while, but the end came rather quickly."
The old magus sounds disappointed, yet happy.
The girl doesn't answer.
Her mind has been swallowed by darkness.

"Thenyou will take the girl as planned?"
"Do not put it like that. It is not as planned. It cannot be helped. Matou Sakura's mind disappeared. So there is nothing left that can control the monster.
 So although I know it is brutal, I must take over my empty granddaughter."
A laugh.
Coming from the girl's throat.
Rising from her throat... is the old man's laughter.

"Then please hurry. My body is disappearing. I will disappear unless I am quickly supplied with magical energy."
"Very well. I shall start.
 ...My, this is disappointing, Sakura. You raised it to that degree. I wanted to give you the glory of obtaining the Holy Grail, but it cannot be helped.
 If you must curse someone, curse yourself. The ritual did not succeed in time because you let Ilyasviel go."

A gritting sound.
A worm squirms to swap her head.
It isn't visible.
There are no worms on the girl's body.
It's not on the outside...
It's a distorted thought that creeps up from her heart.

Worm-user, Matou Zouken.
His main body, the host of his rotting soul, is a false nerve hidden within Matou Sakura's heart.

"Hah, her body hasn't changed yet, but I am not one to complain. I shall now take your flesh as my own.
 Farewell, Sakura. You've endured more than I expected from an experiment. You have done well to please me...!"
A sound of writhing blood vessels.
Matou Zouken's spirit orders his main body to eat the girl's brain.

But.

"There's no need for that, Grandfather. I'm fine."

The girl puts her hand on her chest and wakes up.

"Oh. I thought it had consumed you, but you still persist? ......Hm. Sakura. The circumstances have changed, and I can no longer maintain Assassin.
 It will burden you, but form a contract with him."
The old magus gives her an order.
But the girl shakes her head in refusal.

"What? What do you mean?"
"I told you already, Grandfather. There's no need for that."
An ice-cold voice.
At that instant.
A vast darkness swallows the white skull on the wall.

"Gi!?"
"Wha!?"
The surprise comes too late.
The assassin's body is compressed in an instant, his mask the only part not crushed.
"Gahah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!?"
The mask falls.
Under the white skull...
The face that should be there is a skull, just like the mask.

"......Fufu. Oh, I wondered what sort of face you had, but you had none to begin with.
 You didn't hide your face, but wore the mask to make people think a face lay beneath it. Such a disappointment."
"GiGirl, you"
"You lost your face and name, but you still wanted eternity? ...But how unfortunate. If you seek eternity, you should've sought to live forever like my grandfather.
 The Holy Grail can't go back into the past and regain your name."

"Disappear, old man of the mountain. You're nothing but an assassin. You can't become the one and only Hassan."
"Gi, giaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Even his death cry is swallowed by the shadow.
The white skulled assassin is swallowed by the girl's shadow.

"Guhare you insane!? What are you doing, fool...!?"
His panic is akin to fury.
Is he surprised, oris he frightened?

In response to the old man's scream, the girl smiles.
"He attacked Senpai twice.
 That's why I killed him. I'm the only one allowed to hurt him."
"Wha"
"And Grandfather. You don't need to be protected by him anymore. So we have to give him leave."

And then...
She sticks her finger into her heart and pulls out a worm that was deep within her nerves.

"!!!!"
How do you describe the fear, the terror?
She gouged her heart and tore her nerves, but still smiles.

"WWhat, what are you doing, Sakura"
The worm wriggles.
The girl stares with empty eyes at her grandfather, what used to be her grandfather, what seems to have been her grandfather.

"Oh. It was easier than I expected. I thought you would be bigger."
No. Actually, Matou Zouken's true body wasn't this small.
The old magus switched his main body when he planted himself in her heart.
To inhabit her heart, he had to be smaller than a heart.
In retrospect, his strange preference was his downfall.

"SakuraSakura, don't tell me..."
"I should thank the priest. I would've been swallowed if he hadn't eliminated you."

She sees through his plan.
No, this outcome was inevitable.
The old magus didn't even try to hide his intentions, and the girl didn't disobey him.
So there was no problem.
She was just a piece of flesh that the old magus would eventually take over.
Until she betrayed him.

"HHold on, hold on, hold on, hold on...!!
 No, no, Sakura...! Possessing you is my last resort. I shall entrust you with the gate as long as you are still conscious. All I want is for the Matou bloodline to prosper.
 All I want is for you to win and obtain everything...!"

The worm squirms around.
The girl smiles at the trash in her fingers.

"All the better, then. I don't need your help anymore. I can open the gate by myself."

The impossible occurs.
The old magus only made one mistake.

"! Wait, wait, please, Sakura...!
 This has all been for you...!
 And this is how you repay me"

"Goodbye, Grandfather.
 It must've been tiring to crawl about underground for two hundred years, right?
 You can disappear now."

The old man has raised her too much.
Believing her to be pure, he never noticed the darkness within.

...The girl's the only one left at the altar.
The swaying black fire rejoices at the independence of the girl that embodies it.

"Fuh."
The girl stares at the blood on her hand, "FufuFufu, ahahahahahahaha"
And laughs like an empty puppet.
Two black figures crash against one another.
One is Rider, running at great speed, striking at her enemy from all possible directions.
Her long hair blown behind her, she looks like a beautiful shooting star.

But.
A shooting star is a small star, after all.
The swordsman who Rider faces.
Rider cannot break through Saber's guard, as she firmly fixes herself on the ground and overwhelms Rider.

No matter how quickly Rider leaps to attack her blind spots, Saber deflects the daggers with a single swing of her blade, striking Rider in the same motion.
Her severe firmness reminds me of a black sun.
A large star that will consume you once you draw near.
No matter how fast Rider may move, an ephemeral shooting star can never match the light of one that burns in place.

"Haah"
Her sneak attack is repelled yet again, and she's wounded.
...She can retreat as Saber counterattacks because of her superhuman speed.
Rider closes in and withdraws in an instant, just like a black spark.
But her efforts merely prevent a fatal blow.

The difference in their powers is obvious.
Rider's speed decreases the more she attacks.
High-speed movement and continuous offense.
Natural healing that regenerates the wounds Saber sustains.
She's not thinking about anything that comes after.
She can't match Saber unless she uses all of her energy.

Rider's blocking Saber's attacks by attacking.
Once Saber shifts to offense, she and her master will be killed instantly.
Therefore, Rider keeps running, knowing she'll eventually burn out.

Her energy's lost with every passing second.
Rider said she could last two minutes.
It's been ten minutes since passing that limit.
Rider's legs are starting to give in to the strain.

In contrast, Saber is unscratched.
Rider's attacks have not reached her, and she shows no fatigue.
Technique, vitality, magical energy.
Saber overwhelms Rider in these three aspects.
Thereforeonce Rider loses her speed, her sole advantage, Saber will shift to offense.

Rider's speed is declining.
...It's only a matter of time before Saber catches up to Rider's speed.
A few more seconds. Rider will be out of breath once her next attack is blocked.
The instant Rider loses her strength and magical energy, Saber will slice her body in half.


But this has been predicted.
Before they came to the cavern.
The boy told Rider of his prediction, of this exact outcome.
She knows she'll lose if she fights like this.

There's only one way to change the outcome of death.
They hold their breath and wait for the moment

Rider attacks Saber.
At the same instant.
I loosen the restraint on my left arm
and
start
the projection.

I'm disappearing.
         Loosening the Shroud on Archer's arm

                           Search.
I'm blown away.
                  The wind's strong.
I'm losing my comprehension of what's before me.

Let go of the right hand.
Put the Shroud back on.
I can't bear it for even a second.
I'll lose everything.
I'll lose what I value.
          Search, select.
No, every part of my body's dying at this moment.

Rider's fighting desperately.
I can't whine about this.
I... have to do... what I can... and fight.
I can't lose my concentration for even a second.
Rider's going to time it.
I have to free my left arm so I can match her timing.

          Select, analyze.

But it hurts.
It's painful and scary.
QuickQuick, is        Rid  .


It disappears.
Something I value disappears.
I can't remember what I lost.
But what I kept in my heart cannot be recalled ever again.

            Defer. Defer. Defer. Defer.

Slash.
My right lung is torn from within.

"Guh"
Not yet?
I can't stay conscious.
Rider's also desperate.
I won't lose.
I give all I have to keep watching Rider.
Rider's fighting her fight.
I'll fight my own fight

"......!"
Rider stops.
Rider must have exhausted her reserves of energy, because she's on her knees in front of Saber.

Saber's sword moves.
Rider's going to be killed.
I...
I can't just abandon Rider.
I bear the pain and the shredding memory.
I pull out the Azoth Sword and run to the black swordsman.

If my determination was quick, my action was quick as well.
My legs are strong as an explosion, and my body's fast as a bullet.

Regurgitation of blood, backflow of my senses, backflow of poison.

My left arm and my body become one.
An inexperienced warrior named Emiya Shirou turns into a supreme superbeing.


A second feels like ten.
I can manage it.
I can match Saber by sacrificing Emiya Shirou.

"Run, Rider!"
I run to the confronting figures and attack from the side.
"......Shirou...!?"
Rider's on the ground.

Saber can only react with her eyes.

I got her.
I take aim at her open side and cut at her left arm with the Azoth Sword.

"Wha"
It breaks.
The sword that should've cut through Saber's arm shatters at the moment of contact.

At the speed of light, the counterattack comes.
An arm flies off.
A severed left arm rolls across the ground, just as I planned.

"......"
Rider jumps back, while Saber just stands there.
"AhAhh, gah......!"
I kneel, trying to staunch the flow of blood from my left shoulder with my remaining hand.

"Ha, guh, guh, ahhhh......!"
I writhe in agony.
"It is not that I could not react. There was no need to react, Shirou."
The black swordsman states without emotion.
She comes near me.
She steps behind my back, and...

"Now you have lost your weapon. ...Sakura does not say it, but she wishes you to live. I am to take you to her if I am able to neutralize you before you die.
 But"

The tip of her sword pricks my spine.
A cold weight of death, able to pierce my heart with one push.

"...Choose. You can die by my sword or receive a death worse than death from Sakura. The decision is yours, Shirou."
...I'm losing consciousness.
My blood's flowing out of me, and a sword is pressed against my back.


...I don't know what I chose.
There's only one thing I'm sure of.
It's that I can't save Sakura no matter what
I pass my limits.
I project a weapon to stop Saber while maintaining the projection for Rider.


I lose my cool.
My thoughts surpass the speed of light and white out.
Madness is in the past, and the perception of madness is the starting point.

"Trace, fractal."
Shrinking endlessly, expanding endlessly, multiplying endlessly.
The fantasy turns into chaos with law, it came from nothingness, but it didn't come from nothingness, and many similarities arise from expansion.

"I am the bone of my sword."

I ready the sword I projected.

     "Kaladbolg."

There's no need to aim.
The image of it hitting is there, so this attack will surely hit Saber.

"Gi, guh.........!!!!!"
It's      .
Som          unreturnable         breaks.

I see the result with my ruptured left eye.
Rider has retreated from Saber.
Having just repelled the spiral sword, Saber is unable to pursue her.
The small opening lasts a mere two seconds.
But those two seconds are more than Rider needs.

"Noble Phantasm!"
Fifty meters.
Seeing the sudden gap between them, Saber instantly realizes Rider's intention.
Then there's only one way to oppose it.
A strongest attack for a strongest attack.

Black light flows out.
A scorching wind bursts forth from Saber's sword.
A comet will attack her in the next second.
The strongest Noble Phantasm is employed to wipe out the pure white light from Rider.

"Saber......!!!!!!"
Rider lowers her stance.
The summoning circle's already completed.
A giant eye bound by blood materializes in front of her.

"Come, Rider!"
The sword, readied beside her.
Converging and spinning, the light of the star reaches the critical point.
The black sun stands ready, the flare held in both hands.

"Bellero"
Its true name is cast.
Rider's figure is instantly covered in white.

"Ex"
The true name is revealed.
Saber's sword transforms into a blazing black flame.

  "Phon!!!!!!!!!"
  "Calibur!!!!!!"
The two lights in the cavern contend for supremacy!

At that instant, I stop time.
I accelerate all my processes, disguising this instant as eternity.

"Trace, on."
Search, select, analyze, project.
That's my role.

The second projection.
Magic that shaves my existence away.
But we can't beat Saber without it.
We can't match Saber's Noble Phantasm, even with Bellerophon.

We knew that already.
So I'm going to make her win.
If Rider's Noble Phantasm is inferior in force, I'll make up for the difference...!!!!

"I am the bone of my sword."

I already know what I have to use.
The projection's completed in an instant.
The greatest protection Archer knows, the Noble Phantasm that will lead Rider to victory!

"Rho Aius!"

I make it into reality using its true name!

"Gah!"
A shudder runs through my outstretched arm.
Nerves, muscles, and blood dance around like mad.
I frantically hold my convulsing left arm with my right.

"Gu......! Ah, ah, ahh!"
Bear it.
I can't stop the projection.
The lights are still competing.
If Rider loses Aius now, she'll be vaporized in an instant!

"Giah,    ,  !"
My left arm jumps about, while my shoulder fires bullets into my body.
The magical energy I can't control explodes inside my body, and just like an eraser, turns Emiya Shirou's body white.

"      ,                                 !!!!"
I roar out.
I scream to ward off the pain and the fear of losing myself.

Bare magical energy is smashed.
It completely destroys the balance between the two.

"Ah, ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!"

Scattering the fourth petal the black ultimate light penetrated through, it fills the cavern
with bright, white light.

The two Servants are blown away.
Rider smashes against the wall at the exact speed at which she charged.
Saber is hurled backward by Bellerophon and falls to the ground on her back.

They're both alive.
Rider must've used up her magical energy as she's still on the ground.
But Sabershe's deeply wounded, but she still has some power left.

"!"
We barely had the edge in the confrontation of the Noble Phantasms.
Bellerophon had ninety percent of its light offset by Saber's holy sword.

"Ah"
I run.
I run without understanding what I have to do.
I release the Azoth Sword while I run.

"Sa, ber."
I run to her.
I run to her and straddle her defenseless body.

"AhShi, rou?"
Did she hit her head?
Saber's looking up at me absent-mindedly.

"Ah."
How must I look to her?
I'm on top of her, looking down with a dagger upraised.


Saber's natural healing power is extraordinary.
She'll regenerate unless I finish her off right now.
Finish her here.
We'll be killed unless I kill Saber, who's wounded and unable to fight back.
"! Rider......!!"
I trust her.
I have to trust her and wait.

What good will it do, even if I attack Saber now?
What can I do with my projection that's already prepared?
Our plan's already been determined.
Rider accepted my strategy, temporarily acknowledging me as her master.
So

"!"
Saber's sword cuts through empty space.
Rider has already retreated out of Saber's range.
And it's the greatest retreat possible.
She jumps back to the edge of the cavern.

Saber can't pursue her.
Rider's chain is tangled around her legs.
That's why Rider went on her knees.
Rider persistently attacked Saber's upper body, entangled her legs as the final attack, and nailed her in place by piercing the nail dagger into the ground.

"You cannot stop me with such a thing...!"
Magical energy courses through Saber's body.
Saber takes on lightning and easily destroys the chain.

"!"
But it's too late.
The small opening lasts a mere two seconds, but that's more than Rider needs.

"Noble Phantasm!"
Fifty meters.
Seeing the sudden gap between them, Saber instantly realizes Rider's intention.
Then there's only one way to oppose it.
A strongest attack for a strongest attack.

Black light flows out.
A scorching wind bursts forth from Saber's sword.
A comet will attack her in the next second.

Saber's natural healing power is extraordinary.
She'll regenerate unless I finish her off right now.
Finish her here.
We'll be killed unless I kill Saber, who's wounded and unable to fight back.
"AhAh."
My fragmented mind is strangely clear right now.


...She must be conscious again.
Saber's staring at me with cold eyes.
I...
There's no hesitation.
Holding her gaze, I bring down my heavy arm.

There's no resistance.
I end Saber's life with one blow.

", "
There were memories.
There was the warmth of life.
Her warmth was always by my side.

I kill her along with those memories.
I search through my mind and throw them away to where I can't find them again.
They'll never return.
I'll never recall her now.
Such a thing will never be forgiven.

I chose this path.
I killed someone else to save Sakura.
Using my own hands, I killed someone who protected me until the very end.
Neither regret nor a confession will bring forgiveness.
...This is what it means to ally with someone.
I'll keep sacrificing important things for the one I love.

And on this path...
There's nothing brilliant enough to make up for what I've lost.

"But Saber"
I'll search all my life for happiness that can measure up to what I've lost.
I'll keep losing more than I gain, and I know I'll stop someday.
ButI'm going to take responsibility for stealing things away, even if I'm pathetic, comical, or meaningless.

I don't know where I can find happiness.
But I swear to myself that I'll never give up, even if I can't see the end.

"Thanks. You saved me many times."

...The weight on my dagger disappears.
Silent to the end, the dark swordsman sinks into the black shadow, her eyes fixed on me.
...I can't bring the blade down.
My hand's shaking, and I can't pierce Saber's heart.


She's just looking up at me.
She's staring at me without emotion or interest.

Only a few days.
It's only been eight days since the night I lost her.
...No I should say it's already been eight days.
It's been that long since I lost her clear, golden hair and her gentle, green eyes.

I can still clearly recall her silver armor and the beauty of her attacks.
Even though I knew nothing, she accepted me as her Master, serving as my sword to the very end.
No matter how many times she was wounded and faced death.
      Her determination never wavered.

I won't forget about it.
I can't forget about that night, that miracle.
The golden hair shining under the moonlight.
It's...
An eternal scene that will never be lost, no matter how much she changes.


And I realize.
I can't kill Saber.
Even though she has turned dark and her magical energy's ominous, she's still the Saber that protected me.
Sohow can I kill her?

"Sa, ber."
...The dagger falls.
Not onto her chest, but onto the ground.

"........."
The black swordsman says nothing.
Her body's completely healed now.
...It's probably because of the enormous amount of Sakura's magical energy.
Her body's not the only thing that healed, as her magical energy is charged as well.

"Shirou. I have cursed you for the first time."
I can understand Saber's hatred.
"You are telling me to kill you."
It's natural that she's disappointed.

"Very well.
 As you wish, I shall"
The cave rumbles.
What's happening off in the darkness?
A rumbling, like a death cry, comes from the way Tohsaka went.

The vibration sounds like a lamentation.
The person causing the rumbling is frantically calling for help?

"Saber...!?"
I don't know if it's because of the vibration, but Saber's body is sinking into the ground.
No, she's being swallowed up by her own shadow.

"Give me your hand, Saber...!"
"I shall postpone your execution. Sakura is asking for help."

"......!"
...The shadow fades away.
Having drawn Saber in, it seeps into the rock and disappears.





", "

"!"
I suddenly wake up.
I realize I'm sleeping in an unfamiliar place.

"............"
...No, something's wrong.
Something's wrong, but I can't put my finger on it.

"Ha, guh"
I get up.
I shake my head and clear my mind.
"...That's right. I have to go."
I eliminated something important at the cost of something important.

"...The dagger... I have to take the dagger."
I pull the Azoth sword from the ground.
That's odd.
Why is the dagger that was in my hand sticking out of the ground?

"Guh"
I tighten the restraint on my left arm.
I've used up most of the magical energy.
What's left in Archer's arm and myself.
I should be able to do more if I combine them, but I can only manage one more projection. I won't be able to suppress Archer's arm after that.


...I'm forgetting something.
...But I should hurry for now.
My body's stiff.
I feel like I'm a tin man.

......Someone's calling for me in the distance.
The voice, the unfamiliar voice, feels like something important, and I move my tin body forward.

It takes time to go through the cave.
The rumbling has already stopped.
A warm wind that makes me want to vomit is coming from the back.


My left arm hurts.
My brain shreds a little more with each step, and my thoughts are crumbling apart like a collapsing building.

I escape from the black darkness into the white darkness.
...My body's burning.
I'm a brazier, and it feels like I'm thrown inside a furnace.

My headache's getting worse.
My breath is hot, and the air's even hotter.
The heat burns my lungs, and the rotten air sticks to my throat.
I was wrong.
This isn't a furnace.  It's like being inside a giant stomach.


This is the last stage.
The final destination, where Sakura hid herself, Zouken lurked, and Tohsaka has now gone.
But it's too quiet.
I don't feel any battles going on.
Everything's so intensely white that I can't find Zouken's laughter, Tohsaka's figure, or Sakura's downcast expression.


I walk forward without a thought for what might have happened.
I don't have time or energy to waste on that.
My thoughts are a precious resource right now.
I can project one more time.
I can't degrade my final weapon with unnecessary speculation.

I scale the cliff.
I keep my head blank as I climb, conserving what little of my mind remains.

A pillar of light that's like a black sun.
There...
...Stands Sakura, transfigured to black.

"Sakura."
"...?"
Sakura looks at me with wonder.
Red eyes without emotion.

"Sa"
The coldness of her eyes brings everything to a halt.
How stupid.
I made the same mistake again.

"Oh, you're here, Senpai. You were so late, I thought you ran away.
 I'm sorry, I'll call myself back.
 It was a mistake to arrange them at the exit to surprise you."

She smiles.
At that instant, my spine turns to ice.
Sakura's smile is so unlike her that it makes me forget about what I have to say or what I have to project.

"Sakura. Where's Tohsaka?"
I ask a stupid question.
Completely forgetting about bringing Sakura back, I ask something I don't need to, something that's readily apparent.

"Eh... Nee-san?"
My question hasn't taken her by surprise.
It seems she's pitying me for failing to grasp something so obvious.

"That's right. Tohsaka should've come here before me. Where is she?"
"............"

The air's hot.
It feels like the wind on my skin is melting my body.

...I look around the cavern from here.
I don't see Tohsaka below.
The only sign of human life is here.
...By Sakura's feet.
A cloth that looks like a ribbon is on the ground, dyed in black.

Tohsaka's presence is gone.
Tohsaka's body is gone.
Tohsaka's bloodstain doesn't even exist.

"Sakura, you..."
"Yes, you're right. Nee-san's nowhere in this world now.
 BecauseI consumed her just now."

Who is it?

"Oh, I didn't leave any leftovers.
 I finished every bit of her body and mind. Even with this body, I still remember my manners."

Who is it?

"But Nee-san isn't dead. She's still suffering inside of me.
 ...Hah. So she was a virgin. I'm letting her experience what I've been through, but she's already crying on the first day."

"Can you hear her? She's screaming for help and apologizing.
 Oh... How cute of you to say that. She said 'please let me out of here, Sakura.'
 Stupid Nee-san. I want to have more fun if you say that."

Who is it?

"Fufu, I might lose myself since it's so good.
 Thanks for the food, Senpai. The person you brought me was a delicious treat."

Who's outer shell is that?

My remaining thoughts ignite.
My reason explodes, and I'm starting to forget what I'm supposed to do and who the person in front of me is.

"Sakura, you"
...You went too far, too far away for me to retrieve you.

"Please stop. Don't look at me with those eyes.
 ...Don't you know it's your own fault? You spared Saber, so Nee-san wasn't able to kill me in the end.
 If Saber hadn't come to save me, I would've been killed instead."


"But I'm so happy. You saved Saber and me, and you killed Nee-san.
 So"

"No, I..."

"I'll swallow you too.
 Come on, Senpai, Nee-san's waiting for you."

"Nee-san's been asking for your help. You should go to her and hold her hand or something."

The shadow falls.
The light from the pillar's blocked off as if a giant wall is created.

...Black shadows emerge.
I don't know where they came from, but the giants surround me like a prison.


There's nowhere to run.
The giants melt into each other, becoming a tidal wave that surges over me.

All my senses disappear in an instant.
An infinite, boundless darkness.
I hear someone weeping as I fall into Sakura's shadow.
She is released.
The black Command Spell cloaking her body disappears.

A contract-breaker.
A Noble Phantasm that nullifies all magic and negates the contract with a Servant.
Without taking Sakura's life, it destroys the contract that bound her.

My vision isn't continuous.
Sakura's alive.
I don't know if it's reaction from being released, but she's lying on the ground like she's sleeping.

TohsakaTohsaka will make it too.
She's not bleeding anymore. She has a legitimate Magic Crest.
The Crest is the crystallization of the Tohsaka family's magic. It won't let their successor die even if she's unconscious.


The cavern is shaking.
Angra Manyu.
A ridiculous curse called "all evils of the world" is writhing.

...Damn.
Even after losing its host, the black shadow hasn't disappeared.
It has grown too large.
It can come out without Sakura's help.
It will emerge so long as the Great Holy Grail still exists.

I'll destroy it.
I'll destroy the giant magic circle, and the shadow along with it.
Angra Manyu's fetal activity is slowly destroying the cavern.
...But I don't think it'll die even if the cavern collapses.
I have to destroy that thing here and now.

Is it possible?
...Yes, it's possible.
I'll go as near it as I can and attack it with great force.

Angra Manyu can't move as long as it's in the black fire.
I'll cleave it in two before he can emerge.
If there's anything capable of such a feat, it's
The greatest Noble Phantasm I know of.

"Guh."
My breathing stopped for a moment.
There's about a hundred meters to Angra Manyu.
...It's fine, I can walk this distance.
It's just one more time.
One last projection, and it's all over.
It's fine, I'll be able to do it.
I'll finish this off, take the two of them above ground, and...

"Shirou, do you hear me?"
Someone taps my shoulder.


...Who is this?
She can't possibly be a stranger.
I know her. She looks dangerous, but I remember that she's trustworthy.

"Good. Can you take Sakura and Tohsaka and get out of here?"
"Shirou?"
The long-haired woman stares at me for a few seconds.

"What about you?"
"I'll go after I destroy that thing. It'll be quick, but every second counts for Tohsaka. And Sakura would be affected by the shadow if she stays here. Angra Manyu might be persistent and make Sakura his Master again."

"Understood. I will carry Rin and Sakura.
 Please rest assured. I have rested enough for that."
"Please. Go outside with those two. The cavern's collapsing. Um, RR- damn, your speed would have no problem with the falling rocks."

".....................
 Then I will be going. I shall come get you after I get them to a safe place."

"Um... That's nice to hear, but make sure they're okay first. You're the only one I can trust. I'll escape by myself, so please treat Tohsaka. Sakura can't be happy without her."

...I don't think this woman has any ability to heal people.
But I still have to entrust her with Tohsaka's life.

"Certainly. But the same goes for you, Shirou.
 Sakura needs you and Rin. Please remember that. ...I need you to support Sakura."

"......?"
"I shall hurry. Good luck."

The woman in black picks them up with ease and runs down the cliff.
Weaving between the falling rocks, she hurries to the exit.

"Phew."
...I don't have to worry about them now.
They'll be saved if I let her take care of them.
So
Now, I just need to take care of one more thing.
;  ", , "
My consciousness is breaking apart.
A mere hundred meters become an impossibly vast expanse.

;  ", , "
It's only a matter of time before the cavern collapses.
The ceiling's crumbling down, and the ground is becoming a pile of rubble.

;  ", , "
My joints are stiff.
It hurts to bend my limbs.
My nerves are hot.
Hundreds of blades are growing out of my body.
An inescapable death by skewering.
I am the bone of my sword.
I already knew that.
The time bomb was activated when I used projection.
This end has already been determined.

"Ha, ah!"
I'm crumbling apart.
I'll shatter if I continue.
I'll shatter to pieces, like so many rocks on the ground.

...I'll still make it.
My body's dying, but I won't lose myself for about a day if I stop now.

Only a day's worth of life prolongation.
But right now, I would love to have something so insignificant.
Just a day. An hour or even a minute.
If I can live, I want to stay here as long as I can, no matter how miserable it may be.

"Haa, gu......!"
A crack.
Not outside, but inside. The nucleus accumbens in my cerebrum breaks.
The part that administers the principle of behavior, the linkage to pleasure.
The most important part of life. Life is the pursuit of pleasure; without it, humans would become beasts.

"Haa, ah."
It's not convenient.
I still want it.
I want to keep my memory for as long as I can.
But it's disintegrating.
The pain of eating my fingers doesn't stop the memories from fading.

I disappear the more I walk on.
I won't make it.
Even if I do make it there, I probably won't remember what I need to do.
So I should stop here and wait for help

"Yeah, I remember."
But.
Somewhere outside my body, there's a big reason.
"Sakuralet's go see flowers."
So I have to fulfill my role.

Time has stopped.
There's no pain.
I'm taking a whole day to make just one step.

I forget how to breathe.
There's no pain.
I couldn't breathe if I had all day to do it.

I lose the meaning.
What was pain?
Organic matter turns into inorganic substance.

I manage to keep myself.
I reach out for the wall to keep from falling.
All the shards of my existence are gathered onto a tiny foothold.
There's no way it'll support me.
The foothold breaks.

There's no principle of behavior.
There's no meaning of behavior.
There's no meaning of existence.
I don't feel any fear.
The meaning behind my existence disappears.

I'm not alive anymore.
My arms won't move for any reason.

"Trace."
Words come out of my mouth.
There's something still remaining even after language, neopallium, and cerebrum
are lost.

"On."
The body dies.
But the soul remains.

Spinning the eight verses.
The load transmits from the body to the soul, and more meaning is

"Ah."
And Emiya Shirou dies.
The standing figure is no different from a machine.
It's programmed to swing the sword, but it's a corpse with no desire to move.

But even without human intelligence...
There are machines that weave many dreams in this world.

There was a promise.
Once winter's over, when it's spring

A recitation of words without meaning.
A small hope that I remembered until the very end.


I take a breath, drawing enough oxygen to allow me to move.

My throat only moves once.

Fortunately, it's not painful.
Most of my senses have turned to steel.

No matter how hard I try.
       I'm starting to feel faint.

Let's go.
       It's my final job.

I release my left arm.
My consciousness is about to fade away.

"Trace, on."

...My last projection.
I'll use the strongest sword I know to destroy the curse along with the Great Holy Grail.


It'll be the definite end.
I...
", , "
My consciousness is breaking apart.
A mere hundred meters become an impossibly vast expanse.

", , "
It's only a matter of time before the cavern collapses.
The ceiling's crumbling in places, and the ground is strewn with rubble.

", , "
My joints are stiff.
It hurts to bend my limbs.
If I let my guard down, I stop breathing. Finally, with the determination it would take to stick a knife in my throat, I manage to draw a few breaths.
I keep doing it in spite of the pain, because people can't live without oxygen.
I might be able to move without oxygen, and even if I am to breathe, I would stop moving soon.

", , "
...It's hot.
Hundreds of blades are growing out of my body.
An inescapable death by skewering.
I am the bone of my sword.
But I already knew that.

 said...
The time bomb was activated when I used projection.
So this end was already determined.

", , "
...My legs are heavy.
...I don't know what I'm doing.
My heart's about to explode from pain, fatigue, and emptiness.
But just a bit more.
Everything will end once I beat him.
There's no one in my way.
There's no one getting in my way anymore.

But.

"Haaah"
The shadow wavers.
In front of the crater, the Great Holy Grail.
Bathed in the ruddy glow,  is standing.

"Kotomine Kirei."
"Yes. It seems we've both managed to survive, Emiya Shirou."
A voice filled with strong will.
As if it's fate, the man blocks my way through this desolate realm.

"What are you doing?
 There's nothing for you to do now."
I don't ask him how he's alive.
He's dying.
I don't feel magical energy from his body.
There's a black stain where his heart should be.
...Like me, a brief fire that's like a turned hourglass.

I don't hear his heartbeat.
He doesn't have much longer to live.
This is not speculation, but a predication.
Kotomine Kirei will die in a few minutes, even if he doesn't do anything.

"Do not ask something so obvious.
 There is only one goal for me: to give birth to the curse."
"What? You can't do that. He won't become yours."

"Of course not. I cannot intervene with this, and I have no intention to.
 But I have told you. I will bless anything that comes to life.
 This is about to be born. So it is only natural for me to protect it from an outside enemy that tries to kill it."

"...Are you insane? What are you saying with that dying body of yours? And even if it's born like you wish, you'll"

"The same goes for you. There is no sanity here. Our end will be the same, even if we accomplish our goals.
 You will destroy it, while I will protect it.
 But there is nothing to be gained, no matter whose goal is achieved. You came here knowing that.
 This is a meaningless battle. We are two madmen engaging in useless folly."


...Kotomine will not back down.
He won't retreat, and I can't use projection as long as he's there.
I need time to project.
He'll smash my head if I show such an opening.

"...Why? Why are you going so far to protect him?
 Even if he's born, you gain nothing. So why?"
Even on the verge of death, why does he approve of mankind's enemy, all evils of this world?

"There is no room for questions. This is my only pleasure.
 Emiya Shirou.
 As you feel supreme bliss in others' happiness.
 I feel supreme bliss in others' unhappiness."


"First of all, why kill it? It is arrogance to assume it is evil even before its birth. Is it not love to allow a life that yearns to be born into the world?"

"Don't bullshit me. He's killed many people already. I can't let him out."
"Oh. Then let me ask. What is good and evil? Are you saying murder is an absolute evil?"

"That's......"
...I can't answer such a question.
Good and evil mean nothing to me now.
The justice Emiya Shirou believed in disappeared the instant I decided to save Sakura.

"Fair enough. There is no answer from the start. That's what humans are like. There is no clear answer, and they accept a changing truth. We have no absolute truth from the very beginning.
 Humans have both good and evil, and it's up to you to decide which is which. The start is at zero, and there is no crime in being born. I thought I'd already told you."

"Yeah. You said there's no crime in the baby even if it's evil."

"Correct. Humans become good or evil through learning.
 A certain scripture mentions that humans are superior beings to angels. Why? Because there are people who know of evil, but do not become evil.
 It's different from angels, who only know of good since birth.
 Humans have evil, but can live as good, so they are superior to angels, who only know of good."

"And at the same time.
 There are rare moments of goodwill shown by evil men.
 There are bad intentions shown on a whim by saints.
 The contradiction. The coexistence of good and evil is the Holy Grail that makes people human.
 Living is a crime by itself, and there are punishments because one is alive. Good exists with life, and evil exists with life.
 Therefore"

"You cannot inquire about the crime of one who has not yet been born.
 There is no existence that is born as evil, that is unwanted by everyone.
 It has no reason to be punished until it is born."

That's Kotomine's answer.
That man pardons "all evils of this world" for this reason alone.

"So you're going to forgive him? He's someone that can only kill. If you know he'll kill many people once he comes out, he's a definite evil for us...!"

"Yes. His nature is evil. He was made that way, after all. He was born to be evil from the very beginning.
 He's not like people. This is a pure deity that people made.
 Buteven if his actions are evil, we have yet to know what he thinks of it."

"Eh...?"
What Angra Manyu thinks about his own actions...?

"Yes.
 If Angra Manyu considers them evil and agonizes over them, or considers them good and laughs about them. That is not something we can assume.
 If that thing has emotions like those of humans and agonizes over its doings, it is evil.
 But if it has no doubt about its existence, it is good. Everyone wished for him to be that way, after all. If it has no doubt about its function, it cannot be evil."

"Wha"
"Yes.
 Those with defects at birth.
 Those who were not wanted, even before birth.
 It should show us the worth of worthless life: the meaning of birth."

"Would it be able to forgive itself after destroying and losing everything?
 That's what I would like to know.
 I want to know if it is a crime to live as you are, when you are different from others.
 That is why I killed your father and let Matou Sakura live. I cannot come up with the answer by myself. That is why I wish for the birth of what can provide me with the answer."

"That is my goal, Emiya Shirou.
 I am at the opposite extreme from you, as you have no wish for yourself. Our desires are of the same nature."


...I can't comprehend him.
His wish is too alien for me.
...So there's only one thing I understand.
That's the only reason he...

"Sakura. You used Sakura for such a thing?"
I shake off the vagueness, glaring at the priest with all the hostility I can muster.

And...
"Yes. To that end, I have taken many lives. That is why I cannot back out now.
 I told you. That is how I lived.
 I lived to answer that question.
 It will not change, even on the verge of my death."
He makes this declaration, holding my gaze.


His words are bold.
He states it as a matter of course, saying he has no regret or doubts.

"........................I see."
That makes me realize.
We're irreconcilable. I opposed him ever since I first saw him.
...I finally realize why.

I don't want to admit it.
But it seems... I like Kotomine Kirei.
I was frantic to see him as an enemy because I didn't want to accept the fact.

He said we're similar.
I understand now.
We both believed ourselves to be sinners.
And we both lived in a certain way to free ourselves of those chains.
We both knew we could never be freed, but believed it was the right atonement, and sought salvation that would never be given to us.

"Of course you're not going to back out."
There's no way he'll withdraw if he's the same as me.
It's not that he's trying to grant his wish because he's about to die.

...That's right. It's not that he's protecting his oath in his last moments.
That's how he lived until now.
He never walked a different path.
So even if he's to die in the next minute, he doesn't know any other way to live.

"......Humph. And this is also a way to take out my anger.
 I knew it was a possibility, but at last I realize it."

He steps forward.
There's not much time left for either of us.
So we have to settle the match quickly.
We have to extinguish the other's fire before our own blows out.

"I envy you people.
 What I sought, but could not obtain. What I obtained, but could not obtain. Many things slipped out between my fingers, no matter what commandment I used."

'What other people called happiness'

"I am going to release my pent-up emotions here."

'Did not bring me any joy.'

...Yeah. He's empty because he couldn't obtain it, no matter what he tried.
He sought and sought, but couldn't obtain happiness.
And the only way of life he found was carrying death.
So how can he abandon his way of life now?

"I see. I guess I made you waste your time, Kotomine."
I resume breathing.
Pulling oxygen into my lungs, I get my body ready for battle.

"I do not mind. Neither one of us has much time."
Strength enters Kotomine's body.
There's no way this is going to turn into a battle of magic.
We're both almost dead.
All we can do it to drive our fists into our opponent.
There's no technique or strategy involved. It's a mere brawl to the death.

He needs to kill me to make his wish come true.
I need to kill him to destroy his wish.
We both put our lives on the line.
I need to beat him and eliminate the shadow before my life burns out.

He kicks off of the ground and runs straight at me.
"Haa"
I don't have such power left in my legs.
I lower my stance, eyes fixed on his oncoming chest, and...
"Ahhhhhhhh!"
I swing my fist full-force at a speed he can't avoid...!

But my fist swings through empty space, and I'm the one who gets hit.

"Guh!?"
I don't see Kotomine.
That speed. The enemy that charged me disappears from my view in an instant, crouches down by my left side, slams his palm into my stomach, and kicks up at my body with his lightning fast legs.

"Haaguh......!"
His kicks are like fire.
It's been a while since I felt pain strong enough to make me lose consciousness.

"Gi"
How many meters was I kicked up?
The impact was strong enough to rip my head off.
No, if I'm going to talk about impact, then the second blow to my stomach was strong enough to pulverize my organs.

"You"
I know this.
Taking the shortest route without any initial movement. A circle and a line. It tries to damage the inside instead of outside.
"A priest using Chinese martial arts?"
And he's really good at it.
It's not something he copied on the spot...!

"That's not true. My moves are mere mimicry. It's a mimicry of taolu without much in itbut it seems to be enough against a dying man."
He turns to me.

"......!"
He strikes again.
Forcing my fused joints to bend, I get up.

"......?"
But Kotomine stops and looks at his fist.
His hand's covered in red.
"What a troublesome body. The one attacking has to risk his life."
It is...
...A price he had to pay to attack a body made of swords.

"Haaah."
...I gather my consciousness and face my enemy.
It doesn't matter.
He won't stop attacking, even if faced with the thorns of death.

"But this should make a good handicap.
 In short, our fight is..."

"!"
Kotomine lowers his stance.
His trained body is getting ready for the explosion.

"Not a fight against someone else, but a battle with your body at stake!"

The enemy closes in.
Kotomine is far stronger than me.
His fists won't break.
At this rate, the hourglass itself will be destroyed before all the sand spills to the bottom.

"Haa"
I don't look away from my enemy, closing in like a spark.
There's only one thing I have to do.
I have to be faster than last time. I have to punch him faster, even if he avoids it.

All I can hear is the sound of my heart, pounding in my ears.
I take no notice of the rumbling or the raining bits of earth.

The one I must defeat is right in front of me.
I don't care about some centuries-old wish or the end of this small world.
For Emiya Shirou, defeating this enemy is the last remaining purpose.
", , "
My consciousness is breaking apart.

It's only a matter of time before the cavern collapses.
The ceiling's crumbling down, and the ground is becoming a pile of rubble.

No.
I can't go back if I use it.
I know I'm going to disappear anyway.
But I have to try to find some other way as long as I'm alive.

I promised that I'll protect Sakura from everything.
I can't selfishly die.
I want to live with Sakura.
So

"Trace"

...But there's no other way.
Sakura's crime. The absolute requirement for Sakura's happiness is the destruction of this curse.

...Only a single grain of my consciousness is left.
Sakura, I
"Trace, on."
The promise I made with you

;  "            "
A sword is in my hand.
     is      body      last

No, you won't die, Shirou.
     Because I'm the one that's going to shut the gate.


It's...
The voice of someone I can't remember.

"   ?"
I can't remember, but I call her name.
I know I have to do it.
Because     will never return if I don't.

Hey.
Do you want to live, Shirou? Do you want to live on, no matter what kind of life you become?

;  "       "
I want to live. Name. I have to call her name and stop her.
But I want to live. I know      will disappear if I nod, but I want to live from the bottom of my heart.

Yeah.
I'm glad to hear that. I wanted you to live instead of me.

;  "    "
What are you saying, idiot?
Just come back. You won't be able to return if you go any further.
I'll take him, so, damn, I have to remember her name, but my head's turned stupid, and the important name is...

Then I'll show you a miracle.
It's an application of the magic I showed you earlier, but this one's amazing.
This is the sorcery everyone wanted to see, after all.

"   a."
No, I don't need to see it. Just come back.
I...

But the container's a bit cheap.
I can't completely reproduce it using only my own body, but it's all right. You'll be back in no time if you and Rin keep trying.

"   a......!"
She goes to the center.
The person in white becomes the sacrifice, just like in the first ritual to close the Great Holy Grail.

Goodbye.
 We aren't related by blood.
 But I'm glad we were siblings.


  ya.
If that's how you feel, then don't go.
I can't sacrifice you. I said we'd live together to make up for all the time you've lived alone.
Butif one of us has to be sacrificed, then

No.
You said an older brother protects his younger sister, right?
...Yeah. I'm the older sister. So I have to protect my younger brother.

"Ilya."
I remember.
Her name.
Kiritsugu's real blood relative. The girl who was left alone because I came and stole him.
A girl with silver hair and red eyes that's a bit older than me

"IlyaIlya, Ilya, Ilya, Ilya, Ilya, Ilya, Ilya, Ilya!!!"
I can't reach her.
I don't hear voices any more.
I can't see anything in this light.
And at the last moment.

She smiles goodbye and shuts the gate of the Great Holy Grail.

     I can see the sky.

I can go into the sky if I reach out just a bit.

But there's nothing left.
There's absolutely no energy left in my body.

I'm sinking.
The life she saved is sinking.

I clench my fist out of vexation.
I feel something cold in my hand.
The sensation rouses my mind

  'It's all right. Rin will save you.'

Yeah.
There's a miracle in my hand.
A little magical energy.
A small, useless pendant, but it can at least help me reach out with my hands.

I reach out.
The gentle atmosphere and the warm sun hits my skin.

In my hand is the endless blue sky
There's no reception.
The Ryudou Temple hides in the dark, emitting alien powers like a crouching giant.
There must be wind blowing far above me.
If I strain my ears, I can hear it howling.

"...I feel a power from atop the stairs. It seems something is being created in the pond behind the compound."
"No, we don't have any business there. The gate above must be the ostensible gate for the Masters that want the Holy Grail. ...If we want the Great Holy Grail, we have to go down instead of up."
Tohsaka walks away from the stairs into the forest.

"...Are you all right, Rider? There's a boundary field around the Ryudou Temple, right? I heard Servants can only go in from the front gate."

"...I feel some strain, but this is tolerable.
 This area contains the most suitable ley line in the land. Once we get inside, I can recover by drawing mana from the air."
"I see. It must be tough, but please bear with us for a bit."

  We push our way through the tree branches.
There's not even an animal trail over the mountain, so we even have to climb down rock walls.

"Hmit should be around here, according to Ilya... Do you see anything like an entrance, Shirou?"
"What do you mean, 'like'?"

"Like a crack in a rock that we can slip through, or a suspicious-looking shrine. It's an entrance, so I don't think it'd just be a pit."
"...Don't be ridiculous. The stars are out, but I can't see anything in a forest at night"

...Oh, I can.
We must be behind the temple, because I see many dead trees.
There's no sign of human influence.  There's nothing here but dead trees and a small stream.

"...Small stream?"
Hold on.
That means the water's coming from somewhere.

"...Rider. There's a bunch of rocks above the stream, right?
 It's too dark for me to see, but is that a cave?"
"Please do not turn around, Shirou."
I hear a small metallic sound.
Rider must've taken off her restraint.

"......Yes. It's a natural cave, but you should just be able to fit through. It looks like the path ends about a meter in, but I sense a magical camouflage."
"I see, thanks. Tohsaka. I guess there is something like it."

We pick our way down to the stream.
...It's more like a spring flowing out from the rocks.

The stones are piled atop one another where it starts. There's a crack big enough for one person to fit through.
It's like a snow hut made from rocks.
You can see that a huge boulder is blocking the entrance, so nobody would even try to go in it.

"This is it. You can pass through the rock."
Tohsaka walks into the darkness without turning around.
"Please go ahead. I shall protect your back."
I nod and enter the darkness.

The sound of scraping on a hard surface.
I progress down the wet rock using my hands.
The ground slopes steeply downward.

...The weight of the darkness is stifling.
Unless I keep my back to the ground as I move, I might fall into the endless dark.

"........."
I lay flat on my back as I slowly descend.
......It's dark, and I can't tell how far down this path goes.
My breathing echoes in my ears.

"Shirou. I'm going to ask you now."
...Then.
Tohsaka, the one leading the way, suddenly speaks up.

"What?"
"The gem sword. Why did you make it for me?"
She sounds blunt, as if she's just asking to kill time while we're descending.

"Why ask?"
"I've told you I'm planning to kill Sakura.
 Can you really give me a weapon, knowing that?"

I nod in agreement.
Well, Tohsaka certainly has a point.

"I'm not okay with that. But I can't save Sakura without you. It's better to have two people instead of one.
 And projecting the sword was a promise.
 I couldn't keep one of my promises with you, so I wanted to keep the other."

It happened a long time ago.
I asked for Tohsaka's help after I lost Saber.
Tohsaka responded to my call for help, and I made a promise with her.

To let her win.
I promised to make her the victor.

...I can't keep that promise anymore.
So I have to keep the other promise with her.
For the girl I used to admire...
For Tohsaka Rin, who believed in someone who had nothing at the time.

"I see. You're pretty faithful."
"Yeah, but not as much as you."

Silence returns to the darkness.
The conversation ends.
We continue our descent without looking at each other.

A long path that seems to lead to hell.
The path spirals downward, and just as I'm thinking we're over a hundred meters underground...
The dark cave changes completely, welcoming us.

The path that could only accomodate one person widens up and leads on.
There's no need for light.
The cave is lit by a dim green glow, probably from some kind of luminous moss.

The path is saturated with life force.
It feels too lively.
An air of birth, filled with vigor and the joy of life.
An immense amount of odo, and mana so strong that it's almost visible.


It makes me want to vomit.
The warmth of life should be dazzling, but instead it's something rotten, making me want to look away.

"............"

I have no words to say to her.
This is a land of death.
Talking to each other to soften the tension would only cost us our lives.

"Let's go. From now on, look out for your own safety first."
...Tohsaka heads down the path, to the source of the black air.
Rider and I follow after her, concentrating on our surroundings.

"......?"
I see something red on the ground.
It's a trace of blood.
It leads to the back.


Did someone come here before us?
And someone wounded badly enough to leave behind a trail of blood?

"Shirou."
"...Sorry. I'll be right there."
I shake off that train of thought and head on.
I can't be worrying about others.

"!"
My consciousness fades away if I let my guard down.
I'll disappear if I worry about needless things.
"........."
I tighten my grip on the pendant.
Letting the pain clear my mind, I step into the green darkness.
A warm wind hits my cheeks.

At its end, the path opens into a cavern. 
It's about as big as the schoolground.
It's too dark to make out the ceiling, but it must be about ten meters high.

I don't detect any signs of life.
An unforgettable underground space that looks like the moonscape that I read about a long time ago.
And there...
Waits Saber, filled with absolute hostility.

She's the only one here.
I don't see Sakura, Zouken, or Assassin.
The only one blocking the way here is the girl who has turned black.

"Saber."

There's no reply.

...Of course.
Saber's duty is to eliminate any intruders.
She's the gatekeeper and the executioner.
Saber's the strongest Servant Sakura has, so she can fight us by herself.

"...Hmph. It doesn't look like we can talk her into letting us through."
Tohsaka lowers her stance and reaches for the gem sword she's hiding behind her back.

She must intend to fight head-on.
I don't know what kind of ability the sword has, but she's going to fight Saber.

But that's not a good idea.
We still have a countermeasure, since we know Saber's powers. We can't use our only secret weapon when Zouken and Assassin are still waiting for us

"Wait, Tohsaka...! Saber's"
"Rin. I have no reason to fight you. Please do not attack me. I will go against Sakura's orders if I kill you here."

"......!"
Speaking in the same quiet tones as before, Saber stops Tohsaka in her tracks.
We comprehend what she means right away.

"...What are you doing? You're keeping watch here, right?"
"Yes. I am to eliminate anyone that passes by here.
 That is Sakura's order. But"
"I'm an exception, and Sakura wants to see me?"
Saber nods.

"......I see. She must be serious."
She mutters.
...After taking a deep breath, Tohsaka walks over to Saber.

"Tohsaka."
"Sorry. I guess that's how it is, so I'm going ahead."
Tohsaka walks on without hesitation and passes by Saber.
And right before she disappears...

"Shirou. I don't know what'll happen to you, but I believe in you. So you'd better live up to my expectations."

"Huh?"
...Wait.
I can't understand if you complain to me without telling me what I should be doing.

"I-I'm saying it'll just be a pain if you come complaining after everything's over! ...Um, make sure you're not too late if you want to save Sakura."
Tohsaka disappears, her hair fluttering behind her.


...Thanks, Tohsaka.
That gave me strength.
In short, she told me to come help her while she keeps Sakura at bay.

"That is impossible. You will die here, Shirou."
"......!"

Her hostility expands.
Tohsaka left, and Rider and I are the only ones here.
So she doesn't have to hold back anymore, huh?

"I cannot overlook what you just said. You only kill those that pass through. If he merely stays here, you should not harm him."

"I will not attack if he does not move.
 But he will advance, no matter what. He knows he cannot defeat me, but all he can do is move forward.
 Am I wrong, Rider?"
"I see. You served him before me, after all.
 It's natural that you know his personality."

...Saber narrows her eyes.
The black holy sword is in her hands.
She's coming.
Rider or I.
If either one of us takes a step forward, Saber will use all her power to kill us.

"......Saber. There's nothing that'll make you back down?"
"Stop asking me that. I said this is my role."
I grab the Shroud.
...Saber shows no sign of hesitation.
We're already enemies.
I realized that back in the forest.

So...
"I see. Then I'll eliminate you here."
I have to accept it.


"I'm going to save Sakura. You're in my way."
Saber's not my only enemy.
There's still Assassin and Zouken.
I can't be wasting my time here.

"Please stay back, Shirou. I shall fight Saber just as you instructed me."
Removing the restraint on her mystic eyes, Rider motions me back with one hand.

Saber raises her sword.
The hostility is already aimed at Rider

"Don't be stupid. I said we're both going to fight her. You..."
"I may not be able to defeat her, but I can keep her occupied. Fortunately, Saber does not have the ability to repel mystic eyes.
 I cannot petrify her as she has more magical energy, but I can pressure her. I can match her for two minutes if I use all my strength."

Rider's eyes capture Saber.
The mystic eyes, which petrify anyone in her sight, temporarily lower Saber's ability.

"I will create the situation. Please stay there and concentrate so you do not miss our chance."
"Rider."
"I will be going. I shall entrust you with my life, Shirou."

Rider disappears.
The black cavalryman dashes at the swordsman with light speed.

The attack is made so quickly that human reactions cannot even perceive it.
But Saber repels it like nothing.

"Very well. You will disappear first, Rider."
A heavy pressure fills the cavern.
A cruel smile on her face, the black swordsman starts to move.
Her vision spreads out.
The instant Tohsaka Rin escapes the darkness, she forgets that she's deep underground.

The impossibly high canopy and black sun.
The huge cavern isn't a cave, but a desolate land.
There should be two, no, three kilometers across.
In the distance stands a monolithic wall.
...This is the start and the end of this war.
There should be a giant crater above the cliff.
Up there is the system that has been activated for two hundred years.

The massive rock that holds a large magic circle, the Great Holy Grail, belches black fire from its mortar-shaped center.

The embryonic movements of the black shadow.
The light illuminating the desert is a wave of magical energy.
...According to Tohsaka's records, this is what you'd call the altar of the beginning.
The middle that leads to the middle.
The circular circuit, the world of heart, Heavens Feel.
It has immeasurable magical energy, creating an alien world that lives up to its name.

"That's Angra Manyu... So the name 'all evils of this world' isn't just for show, huh?"
Rin talks lightly as she makes her way to the altar.
...She's worried about Shirou and Rider, but her situation isn't too good either.
The magical energy in the Great Holy Grail isn't something a human can handle.

The vortex of magical energy can be called infinite.
There's so much that it won't run out, not even if all the magi in the world come here and use whatever magic they wish.
It's more than anyone can use in a lifetime, and therefore can be called infinite.

"...Nothing is impossible, huh? That Holy Grail really can make any wish come true."
Her determination almost breaks, faced with the numbing premonition of death.
Keeping her spirits up with idle talk, she walks on.

The ones she's watching out for are Assassin and Matou Zouken.
Matou Sakura isn't a threat.
She has lost her mind, and Rin sees no danger from her.
She's just Zouken's puppet, after all.
Rin's greatest enemy is Matou Zouken.
The fight against Matou Sakura isn't important.

"......Strange. I can make it to the altar."
Zouken shouldn't allow an intruder to trespass this far.
If he's planning to attack her, it'll be on the way to the altar.
But it's not happening, and Rin's about to reach her destination.


She thinks.
Why is there no interference from Zouken?  Why can't she feel his or Assassin's presence?
She makes a guess.
She denies the possibility, but easily accepts it.
No, she's forced to accept it.
Because...

"I'm glad, Nee-san. You came here instead of running away."

...Her guess turns out to be true.

She looks up.
On top of the cliff.
With the black sun behind her, Matou Sakura welcomes her older sister.

"!"
Rin retreats a little, overwhelmed by the pressure.
...The girl has been transfigured further than Rin expected.
Angra Manyu is a Servant without form.
It's only a shadow that takes form using people's wishes.
Therefore, its powers depend on its Master.

Matou Sakura is now Angra Manyu.
"All evils of this world", the function to emit the curse is the girl called Matou Sakura.

"...Crap. If Kirei were here, I bet he'd call it a messenger from God."
Rin looks up at Sakura, who has turned into a bottomless well of magical energy, and releases her gem sword.
But is it something that can match the being above her?

There are two functions for weapons that support magic and ceremonial equipment that assist in rituals.
One function is to amplify.
It's a backup, increasing and supplementing one's magical energy and strengthening the spell itself.
These items are considered orthodox support equipment, and magi carry at least one. Rin's jewels are classified in this group.

Another is a limited function.
It's a special magical item where the weapon itself becomes magic.
It's activated using the magical energy of the magus and performs a predetermined divine mystery.
Its greatest advantage is that it enables the magus to use magic she's not capable of ordinarily.

It only has one application and thus lacks versatility, but for that reason, its power is immense.
A lance that always pierces the heart, a bridle that enslaves holy beasts, a dagger that cancels any magical effect.
Noble Phantasms of Servants are usually classified in this group.


So, which is the gem sword?
Is it support equipment that gives magical energy to the user, or is it a limited weapon that defeats the enemy with its unique ability?
...But.
No matter which it may be, nothing should be able to match Matou Sakura.

The difference in their magical energy is too vast.
No matter what kind of a magic it may be, Matou Sakura should be able to drive it back in one breath.

"What's wrong, why are you trembling, Nee-san? ...Fufu, don't tell me you've suddenly lost your nerve."
"...Well said. Where's your guardian? You're a coward, so doesn't it bother you that he's not by your side?"

...The air freezes.
Hostile tension mixes into the warm air in the cavern.


The black girl bites her lip and sighs.
"Grandfather's gone. He was a bother, so I crushed him along with Assassin."
She smiles gracefully.

"......"
She doesn't need to ask.
Matou Zouken was killed by Matou Sakura.
...It's natural that he hasn't shown himself.
The old magus was eaten by his own pet dog.

"I see, so you're completely free. Zouken bound you in a good way and a bad way.
 You don't have anything to fear now that you killed him."
"Not quite. Not yet, Nee-san.
 Killing my grandfather isn't enough. I'm this strong and I can do anything, but I'm still bound."

"...Geez. Nee-san, you're so insignificant, but you won't disappear from within me. You still torment me in my mind.
 Soas long as you live, I can't be free."

Her voice is a light singsong, but the words are heavy as slime.
The contradiction proves her madness.
The hostility in the cavern is a rhapsody of superiority and awe.

"...Oh. But you seem happy in spite of that. You killed Zouken and Assassin, so I should assume you killed Kirei as well.
 What a performance for someone who hated killing... are you getting used to murder now?"

"Yes. Crushing people and eating them are no different.
 For people, it's boring and meaningless if you don't have fun, and it's painful if you don't eat, right?
 It's just the same. I'm the same as you. I'm just doing what everyone else's doing."

"Wait. Do you really mean that twisted logic?"
"It's not twisted logic. I'm not wrong.
 It's different because I've gotten strong. I'm strong, so I'm different now."

"II'm strong. Everything's forgiven if you're strong.
 ...Yes. If I'm strong and no one can beat me, everything I've done will be forgiven. If I'm not myself, everything I've done couldn't be helped...!"

A scream of rage.
It's the complaint of a petulant child who can't escape unless she believes in it.

"Do you understand, Nee-san? That's what I'm going to become. That's why I can kill anyone. It's natural for me."
"......I see. So you're going to take it out on everything you see? But what about Shirou? He still believes he can save you. Are you going to kill him too?"

"!"
The girl stiffens.
Rin's question is her last obstacle.
...Her excitement cools down.
Thinking about him, she regains her sanity.

A serene smile crosses her face.
"Yes. Senpai's no exception.
 Nohe's the only one I want to kill, Nee-san.
 ...Yes. I quickly"

      Want to consume Senpai.


Matou Sakura's reply shows that she is beyond help.
Rin grips the gem sword and gauges the distance between them.

"...Hmph. What about taking Angra Manyu with you?
 I knew you were stupid, but I didn't think you were this stupid. You let yourself be swallowed, and you've already stopped being human."
A voice filled with clear hostility.
As the supervisor of this land, Tohsaka Rin acknowledges her own sister as "evil".

"Fuh. You're bluffing. Please be honest with yourself, Nee-san.
 You're envious of this great power, right? You're jealous, right? That's why you came to kill me even though you can't.
 ......Yes. You're going to take him away from me so you can keep the happiness to yourself."

The shadows stand up.
A magic of absorption, a bundle of magical energy that matches a Servant's Noble Phantasm.
Not one, but many rise up to attack.

"I won't give it to you. This is my power. All I'm going to give you is regret and despair.
 I'll slowly show you what I mean."
There are four figures.
They reach out for the small person beneath them like giants protecting the girl.

"I'll show you the difference in our powers, Nee-san.
 Nobody's going to come help you this time. You can drown in me like a bug in a lake."
The towering shadows attack her.
A titanic power that can neither be blocked nor dodged swallows Tohsaka Rin.
"Sakura."
She calls out and throws it.

Her strongest weapon.
She throws the sorcerer's inheritance.
"Welt, Ende."
The whole cavern is filled with light.

Explosion.
In the act of its own destruction, the miraculous gem sword erases all shadows.

She runs.
She runs straight at Matou Sakura.
Sakura can't move, wincing from the light.
No matter how much power she has, she's still inexperienced in battle.
So it's easy to beat her once she sets her mind to it.

Tohsaka Rin quickly closes in.
As she runs, she grasps another dagger hidden behind her back.


Sakura can't react.
It seems she's realized she's going to be killed, but it's too late.

...She's got her.
She thrusts the dagger to finish her off, Oh, I can't.
and realizes her own defeat.

'...I'm dead.'
She understands that the dagger will pierce her heart before she can dodge it.
Her body tries to counterattack, but it won't make it in time.

'I'm going to be killed.'

There's no fear.
She's used to being hurt by others.
And she thinks it's natural that Rin is the one doing it.

But she doesn't like getting hurt and dying scares her, so she closes her eyes.
She sighs with relief; after all, once she dies, the pain will end.

"?"
But there's no pain, and the end doesn't come.
Warmth fills her instead.
The instant she realizes what it is...
Matou Sakura regains her sight.

...There's blood.
Warm, human blood, flowing from the stomach.
The blood's flowing out of her older sister, whose arms are firmly wrapped around her.

"...Nee-san?"
The girl asks why.
Rin was definitely faster.
She could've killed her, but she stopped her dagger at the last second.

"......Geez. I can't be complaining about Shirou."
A faint voice.
It's the voice she's always dreamed of.
The voice of Tohsaka Rin that's relentless, but warm and kind.

Rin thinks to herself.
...It's nothing special.
She just realized when it counted the most.
Right when she saw Sakura up close, she realized she couldn't kill her.

"......Geez. I'm stupid."
...She's dumbfounded.
Her foolishness must be absolute if she doesn't realize it until the very last moment.
She should've realized it earlier.
...But Rin's convinced that it can't be helped.

"...Yeah, it can't be helped.
 I can't ignore a slouch. I like orderly schemes, and it irritates me when people aren't repaid for their efforts."

And first of all...

"I like you, Sakura. I've always watched you, and I wanted you to smile. ...Yeah. I wanted to believe that you had it better the more I suffered.
 I was so preoccupied with that, so I didn't even have time to think about if it was painful or not."

She embraces Sakura with love.
A once-in-a-lifetime embrace between sisters.
She softly embraces her sister, who pierced her stomach, and holds her there like a treasure.

"Neesan"
......Her warmth fades.
There's no complaint.
Tohsaka Rin regrets, not her death, but her inability to save her sister.

"I'm sorry I'm a selfish sister.
 ...And thanks. I'm glad you always wore that ribbon."
She crumples to the altar like a falling red flower.

"Ah."
The weight disappears.
It only lasted for an instant. Her older sister disappears along with the warmth.

But Sakura. Even as insensitive as I am...
       I never thought I was blessed

"No."
What kind of loneliness is contained in Sakura's words?
Her agony for her alone.
Nobody else can understand or relieve her.
There's no such hypocrisy.

And at the same time...
What if the girl she admired felt a loneliness nobody could understand?

"No."
...What would happen then?
She was her ideal. Someone brimming with confidence, who had everything she wanted.
What if her older sister were always bound by something, just like her?

"I"
...Then...
The one that's weak, the one at fault, isn't her world...
...But her, the coward who couldn't look up
And there were people who clumsily loved her.

"ButI destroyed them."

...Where did she go wrong?
She had everything.
Everything she wanted was actually right there in front of her.
They loved her and embraced her so kindly.
But she destroyed it all herself.

"Ah.
 Ahh, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh......!!!!!!!"

Her hands are still frozen in place, trying to hug someone who's no longer there.
The girl, wet with her beloved sister's blood, starts to strongly curse herself.
...I hear sounds.
A rumbling shakes the cave.
The light and sound are still far off, but the cavern's creaking and trembling.

Is it distant thunder?
Suddenly I realize that I can't recall when I've ever heard distant thunder.

...The dagger in my hand crumbles away as Saber disappears.
It must be because I eliminated a Servant, a strong familiar.
The Azoth Sword Tohsaka created with all her magical energy crumbles away without a trace.


I tighten the restraint on my left arm.
I've used up most of the magical energy.
What's left in Archer's arm and myself.
I should be able to do more if I combine them, but I can only manage one more projection. I won't be able to suppress Archer's arm after that.

"Ri... der."
That's right. What happened to her?
I get up.

My body's stiff and rigid.
It feels like my joints have turned into steel.
I could probably repel bullets now.

"Are you all right, Rider?"
I can't walk well.
I walk.

Blood comes out.
Something's coming out of my bent legs.
I pretend not to notice.
It feels like a metal pipe's protruding from my leg, but I can manage to walk if I grit my teeth.

...Something's making a sound in the distance.
It sounds like something I heard a lot as a kid.
It's probably still ingrained in my childhood memories.
One gets curious about a lot of things as a kid.

"Rider."
I walk to the wall Rider smashed into.
She's still there.
But she's covered in wounds, with her magical energy almost completely depleted.
She shouldn't be able to move for a while.
...I should have her rest.

"I'm going ahead. Please come after me once you can run again."
I murmur to Rider and start walking.

"Ugh. ...You treat people more roughly than I expected."
Oh, she's conscious.
Unable to stand, she watches me in a daze.

"Sorry. But I'm counting on you. Please come help me after you're slightly healed."
"Yes. Don't worry, I shall follow you shortly."

Rider doesn't push herself.
She knows she should start moving after she heals instead of pushing herself now.
I can depend on her because she actually thinks ahead, unlike me.

...The rumblings are coming at shorter intervals now.
There's no time to waste.
I drag my wounded body and follow after Tohsaka.

"Haa, haa, ha, haa"
I'm breathing hard.
I lean against the wall as I walk.
I'm not making bad progress.
My body's stiff, but it's nothing once I get used to it.

"Guhha, gah."
Something comes out of my mouth.
I wipe it away and pretend nothing happened.

"Guh, ah"
My thigh muscle goes numb, and I almost fall.
It's just a little numbness.
My pants leg is ripped from inside, and I can see inside my body.
Desperately, I look away and walk on.

I'm almost there.
Warm wind hits my body.
"All right."
I slap my cheeks and start running.

I burst out of the darkness.
The familiar deserted land fills my vision.
No.
This isn't something I've seen.
That thing didn't exist in Ilya's memory.

"So that's..."
The main cause of this ridiculous war.
The guy who took Sakura from me.

"It's about to be born."
Pressure and unpleasantness hit my whole body.
The breathing of life tells me it's about to hatch.

A flash of light and a rumble.
The light came from the top of the cliff, wreaking havoc on the cavern.
...I don't know what's going on, but such flashy things can only come from Tohsaka.

Then that means
"You're in a rush."
The distorted embryo looks at me, even though it has no eyes.

...There's no mistake about it.
He wants to come out right this second, maybe because he doesn't like how Tohsaka's raging around.
But his body's not ready yet.
His placenta is inside the black pillar.
He can't come out until his body's completely formed.

He's impatient because Tohsaka's about to destroy the womb itself, and that's why he wants his body completed, even if it may be hurriedly built.
He wants to be summoned into this world as a Servant with a body.

"Fuck that."
I run.
A desperate clash of light and shadow.

"Sakura?"
Once I'm close enough to tell that it's the battle between Tohsaka and Sakura...
The time in this cavern stops.
I can only think of one possible cause of the great light.

'Nee-san'
With a childish cry, the world starts to quake.

This isn't the destruction of the cavern walls by the light.
This is destruction on a more fundamental level. The cavern is shaking because the giant shadow's trying to come out.

"That's"
A chill runs up my spine.
I get a bad feeling.
Hearing Sakura's cry, I imagine the worst possible outcome.

"TohsakaTohsaka, Tohsaka!"
I run.
Panting frantically, I scramble up the cliff on all fours.

The tremor doesn't stop.
I hear a large boulder crash to the ground somewhere in the cavern.

"HaaHaa, haa, haa, ha!"
I don't care what's happening behind me.
I run in desperation, covering myself in dirt.
...And my eyes are seared with the fact that I was too late.

"Tohsaka."
...The ground's shaking.
I can't see Tohsaka's face, since she's lying face down.
She looks like a large flower, fallen from its stem.

"..............., .........Sen... pai..."
I raise my face.
Backing away from Tohsaka's blood-soaked body, as if fleeing, is
...Sakura, cursing her own existence.
"Sakura."
"......I killed her.  Nee-san cared about me, but I killed her"

Sakura's voice isn't directed at me.
She's rejecting everything.
Her own body, covered in Tohsaka's blood, her darkened self, the pillar connected to her.
She's cursing everything with all her might.

"I was stupid. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There's nothing but pain. You always told me not to lose, but I was too stupid to understand. Senpai believed in me, but I just kept betraying him"

The shadow's binding Sakura.
The black Command Spell's binding Sakura's body.

"......No... I have to stop... But I can't go backno, no, I don't want this!"

She's refusing it.
Sakura's refusing the shadow.
She's hating herself, refusing the temptations from the shadow, and trying to kill herself.

But she can't.
Sakura's necessary as a host for the shadow.
It won't allow her to take her own life.
Sakura's being torn apart by both the shadow and her own guilty conscience.


...So Tohsaka won.
Sakura regained her sanity.
Tohsaka chose her sister's life in the very end.

Sakura's Sakura.
Her heart doesn't change, no matter how much the shadow swallows her.
...I'm the one who made her like that.
This would never have happened if I hadn't gotten scared back then and scolded her.

"!"
I run to Tohsaka.
She's still breathing.
It's too early to give up.

"Sakura. Tohsaka's still alive."
"?"

"Right, she's not dead. She can be saved. No, she has to be saved. We have to save her. Right, Sakura?"

"Aheh?"
Light returns to her eyes.
The restraint of the shadow loosens a bit.

Her eyes focusing on us, Sakura finally sighs with relief, "! No, run, Senpai!"
and frantically tries to control herself.

"! !"
Covering Tohsaka's body with my own, I receive the shadow's blow on my back.
"Ahno, Senpai. I, I......!"

The shadows come up behind Sakura.
......Damn it.
He's not alive yet, but his sense of danger's first-class?

"I know. It's that kid's fault for not giving up. He's throwing a tantrum because he doesn't want you taken away.
 Hold on. I'll smack him and get him off of you."
I start walking towards Sakura.

"Noplease stop, Senpai!"
The shadow grazes my cheek.
It should've cut through my neck, but Sakura's scream made it miss.

"Haaah, ah, uh......!"
Clutching at herself, Sakura fights against it.
Instead of disappearing, the shadows keep increasing in number.

"Uh... uhh, uhhhh..."
She's crying.
Sakura's crying.
It's not because of the pain of the shadow swallowing her.
She's crying from frustration because she can't suppress herself.

"......No, Senpai. I can't suppress it. Nee-san taught me, but I'm going to lose. ...I wasn't strong. I'm a coward, a wimp, and a terrible person."
Another step.
The shadow's lance grazes my cheek.

"! No, why are you coming, Senpai...!?
 I'll kill you if you come any closer...!"
Another step.
I put my right hand on my left shoulder.

"Why? Run. Please run, Senpai. Please take Nee-san and run...!
 You can forget about me...! I'll, I'll die here! I can die by myself...! I don't want you to see me like this...!"

The shadow's pressure gets stronger with each step.
My advance is hurting Sakura's body and mind.

"Why aren't you listening to me...!?
 I won't hold back if you're going to come any closer. I'll kill you before you kill me...!"
"I don't need to explain. I'm going to get you out of here and save Tohsaka. That's what I said, right?"

"Are you still going on about that?
 ...Don't. I can't be saved. No, I shouldn't be saved. I shouldn't live."

Another step.
"!"
The shadow hits my stomach.
...It didn't pierce me. It's just a strike.
Sakura's intentionally trying to push me away.

"See, you saw that. This is how I am. I can't go back, and he's not going to let me go.
 Andeven if I do go back..."

"...I've killed a lot of people. I killed many people, killed Nii-san, killed Grandfather, and killed Nee-san...!
 WhatWhat do you want me to do...!? I can't give back what I've taken. I've killed many people. Are you still telling me to live...!?"


...I see.
She can't back out now.
She's trapped by crimes she can't atone for.

There's no salvation.
Even if it wasn't Sakura's will, those actions will haunt her forever.
Even if she's released from the shadow, the darkness will remain within her.
But.

"Of course. You took lives, so take responsibility, Sakura."

I release the restraint on my left arm.
The last time. I remove the red cloth that barely kept me alive.

...I feel faint.
I have to go forward before I disappear.
There are things I have to tell her.

"Sen... pai."
"Yes. I don't know where the crime is, or how heavy it is."
"......!"
The shadows lance toward my chest, shoulder, left leg, and stomach.
Clank.
The shadows don't pierce me, but slide off with a spark.

"But I'll protect you. I'll protect you from everything.
 It may be hypocrisy, but my ideal has always been to protect the one I love"
I move forward.
Sakura's right in front of me now.

"NoSenpai, your body's..."
......Trace, on.
I only think about one thing.
I use every last ounce of my remaining magical energy for its projection.

The last projection.
I raise the dagger that breaks all contracts.
I can't see her face clearly.

"Sen, pai."
"I'm going to punish you. This is gonna be harsh, so grit your teeth."

I hear her gasp.
Then.
With a "yes", Sakura holds out her chest

Hoping this will be her punishment...

"Let's go home, Sakura. Cut your ties with him."

  And I thrust it into her heart with a single breath.
Everything's falling apart.
The collapse is definitive.
The search that took the Einzbern a thousand years.
The earnest desire that took the Makiri five hundred years.
The continuous world that was never completed is about to end.

"OhOh, ohhhhhhh."
Amidst the chaos, it is still conscious.

   I don't want to die

The body's a mere collection of dark red flesh, bearing no resemblance to a human being.
The swarm of worms fills the cavern.
It cannot maintain its body, even when using all of the worms.

"Oh, ohhh, oh, oh"
The writhing figure is just a moving pile of meat.
But it's alive.
The mass curses its rotting, melting body.

   I don't want to die

Its obsession is the only thing keeping it in this world.

"OhhOhh, ohoh"
It crawls.
Makiri Zouken. The old magus, his soul's vessel destroyed, remains in this world only through sheer force of will.
But it's only a matter of time before he dies.
He stuffed his rotting soul into a hurriedly-constructed worm, but he can't heal his wounds after being killed twice.

   I don't want to die

The old magus has turned into a pile of flesh, and will die after going through immense pain.
He'll rot until the very end and die in regret.
With his earnest desire in front of him.
What he yearned for, what he was about to obtain.

"OhOhh, ohhhhh."
Is his dying cry from pain or anguish?

   I don't want to die

He doesn't want to die.
How can he just disappear?
Five hundred years.
The result he achieved after five hundred years, the reward he deserves, is right in front of him, so why does he have to disappear?

"OhOh, ohhhhhhhhhhhh."
He only recalls pain.
Makiri's karma.
A noble family of magi that was driven out of their homeland and declined in this far eastern country, unable to familiarize themselves with the rules of the foreign land.
But that's wrong.
If that were the case, salvation would be possible.
If that were the reason for his bloodline's end, he may have accepted fate.

   I don't want to die

But that's not why.
It's not that the Japanese soil didn't suit them.
The Makiri didn't die out because of an external factor.
They merely dropped out.

It has been three hundred years since the start of their search.
Three hundred years was their limit.
The family died out in Zouken's generation.
The suffering started there, and the old man could do nothing but deny the truth.
Matou Zouken's life was a frantic protest against the end of the Makiri bloodline.

   I don't want to die
I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I don't want to die I don't want to die I don't want to die I don't want to die......!!!!!

"Oh, ohh, ohhhhhhh......!!!!"
Right, dying's not possible. The rotting body. It's painful. Nothing but pain. The five hundred years were filled with pain. Pain filled the whole life. So what's so bad about seeking eternity? Suffering without satisfaction. Can't disappear without leaving anything behind. The Holy Grail is right there. Grant the wish. The answer being "not wanting to die". The wish will come true on top of the cliff. But it's impossible with this body. This short distance is nothing compared to five hundred years. So why is it so far away!!!!?

"Oh, ohh, oh, oh"
The meat crawls across the floor, leaving bits of itself behind.
Such tenacity.
It should have no function to move, but it moves forward with tenacity.

A thought that's filled only with obsession.
Ignoring the impending collapse, it moves forward to the Holy Grail.
But someone calls out to the hideous monster.
"You have changed, Makiri."
A bell-like, beautiful voice.

"What?"
He looks up.
Within the blur.
Stands a girl.


The flesh stops moving forward.
It looks up at the girl in astonishment.
...The old magus doesn't see her.
A woman deep in his memory.
Einzbern's golden saint, who has stayed in his mind without fading.
Two hundred years ago.
His partner sacrificed herself to create the Great Holy Grail.


It hasn't faded at all.
The holy woman still has the eyes he adores.
"I ask of you, my foe. Why do you not want to die?"
And the girl lets out a familiar voice.


The pure question shields his mind from the pain.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Now that she asks him, it is strange.
Why doesn't he want to die?
Why shouldn't he die?
Dying means escaping the pain, so why did he cling onto life along with all the pain involved?

"OhOhh, ohhhh."
He remembers.

Yes. In the beginning, he had a supreme goal.
To obtain all creation.
To obtain all knowledge.
To reach where no man can reach.
To exceed the limits of the body and reach the infinity we call the soul.

The species called humanity has set limits.
To go outside the spiral of the brain.
To eliminate and cure all hatred and suffering.

He remembers.
The grief of finding out there's no such thing as paradise.
If it doesn't exist in this world, if its creation is impossible with a human body, he inspired himself to go to a place where it can be done.
Not to make a new world, but to change his human life.

"OhOh."
...That's right.
To the sky, to the limits.
Be reborn and reach the unimaginable land.
The ideal utopia.

It is for that reason.
That's why he sought the Holy Grail.
He sought a miracle beyond human reach.
He can't disappear until he makes it reality.
He couldn't give up, no matter how many times he was beaten, no matter how often he was shown that he could not reach it.

   There's only one thing he dreamed of.
             To eliminate all evils of this world.
             They risked their lives for an ideal that couldn't come true.

"Oh"
That's why he remained.
He kept seeking even after his enemies died, knowing it was meaningless.
He believed he had a reason to exist, and that his existence would bring on a successor.

That's why he continued to live.
He can't die, no matter how much it hurts him.
He wanted to overthrow the youthful anguish he felt when he was young.
That was his way of life: the answer he came up with.

...Yes.
Even if his life is not compensated for.

"OhOhh, oh......!"
That was his first wish.
The pain.
How small is the wish of not wanting to die, compared to pursuing a wish that will not come true...!?

"I see. You're right, Justizia."
...He looks up at the world.
The cavern's collapsing.
Matou Sakura has been released and taken out of this small world.
The Third Sorcery that was created by mistake, Angra Manyu, is flickering like a heat haze.
And...
The old magus accepts that everything is out of his reach.

"So this is it.
 My desire, my pain, Makiri's missioneverything ends here."
This end was determined at the start.
This is all that Makiri's journey can accomplish, no matter where it ends.

"HaHaha, hahaha."
But.
In no way is it a miserable end to a life filled with pain.

It's probably just a start.
His journey is just starting.
Five hundred years is nothing.
How can it be reached in a mere five hundred years?
What they wished for is distant, dazzling, sacred... something that will come true in the distant future.
A growth of the human species that will come after many years, thousands of years, tens of thousands of years.

So this is a trifling, but meaningful matter to start the journey.
It's not that their desire ends here.
The journey starts here.
The history to reach the distance starts its loop with an end of a dream.

"But how disappointing. My, I was almost there."
The voice is that of the old magus.
No matter what light he sought, he's a heretic who approved of wrongdoing.
Not hiding it until the very end, he cuts his attachment to life.

The last one disappears.
One of the magi that sought a miracle, the observer that also started everything, rots away.

"Five hundred yearshah. Come to think of it, it was a desire that only lasted for an instant."
The pile of flesh is buried without trace by the crumbling rocks.

The one that lived on, taking many forms.
Every last trace of the magus vanishes from the world, as the embodiment of his desire is destroyed.


His palm slams against me.
It doesn't matter what my body's made of.
The attack's meant to damage inside me, so the impact mercilessly pierces through me.

I'm overwhelmed in this battle.
My fists are dodged and parried, while his attacks land cleanly.
Every time his fists hit me, my vision whites out.

It's not because of the damage, but because of the pain brought on by my left arm which tries to heal and overwrite my wounded body.



I protect my head.
My face hasn't turned into swords yet.
It'll be over if I'm hit there.
I can't manage to strike him, so I put everything into fending off his attacks to my head.

My sense of pain's already numbed, and my vision will be cut off soon.
The only pain my brain can sense is the invasion from my left arm.
His bloody fists pulverize my body.
My left arm frantically tries to repair me, and consequently

Everything turns white.
My vision and mind turn too white to be recovered.



Even thinking brings pain now.
As my body is destroyed, swords are created, trying to keep it alive.
In exchange, my brain continues to be ground away.
I don't know which one of us will die first.

"Guh, fu......!"
The bones in his fists are destroyed.
He bears it with an agonized expression and keeps up the assault.



I dodge and swing my right fist.
It's repelled.
A jolt runs through my left rib. I resist the swords stabbing my brain and punch again.



I can still move.
I can still move, I can't move, this is my la-

"Ah."

"Ah"

That hurt. That one hurt.
I shouldn't feel any pain, but my body's about to cry out from it.
Flung like a rag doll, my body hits a large piece of rubble, narrowly avoiding falling off the cliff.

"Ah."

"Ah."


I can't get up.
If the impact hurts this much, the pain to reinforce my body would be beyond imagination.

I'll go crazy.
I'll burn out, unable to bear the pain.
But if I go to sleep before that...
If I close my eyes...

"So this is the end. Then I shall crush your head."
The enemy walks to me.
...He can't run either.
Both of us might disappear within the next minute.
Then

"Ah."

What did you swear?
Who did you swear to protect?

"Ah."

Live.
She said she won't be saved unless both of you are alive.

"Ah, ah."

What did you lose?
What did you lose in exchange?

"Ah, ahh"

The enemy comes closer.
He drags his legs, trying to get close enough to crush my skull.

No way......!
I won't lose! That man has no goal! He's just following his way of life he protected...!
But I have one.
I have a goal.
I have a reason that I have to beat him, a reason that I have to win!

"Ahh, ahah."
I don't know how much I made       cry.
       was crying where I couldn't see her.
She only smiled in front of me, and always cried by herself.

"Ahoh."
...Yes.
So I have to protect her.
The crimes        committed, the crimes that condemn      , the crimes        remembers. I have to protect her from everything.

The girl that could only smile in front of me.
Her body was dying, but she still said she'd protect me

So she can eventually smile in front of other people.

You're getting in the way of that.
"AhAhh, ah"
Get lost.
Sakura can't smile if you exist!

"Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!"

"Guhnu!?"
"Ah, ahhhhhh!!"
One blow.
I punch my enemy in the face with everything I have.

"You, still!"
"Kotomine, Kirei!"
Two blows.

Three blows.

Four blows.

Five blows.

Six blows.

Seven blows!

"Haa, haa, ha, gah!!!!!!!!"
I punch, I punch, I punch, I punch......!!
This is it. There's nothing left if I miss this chance. I put all of my remaining life into this miraculous chance!

", Ah......!!!!"
I'm blown away.
He deflected my attack and counterattacked me with a hard shot.

"Ah, gah, guh!"
Damn! I know! ...He won't let me punch him that easily!
He's many times stronger than me, so he can easily fend off my attacks and come finish me off!

"Haah!"
Yeah, so what...!?
The difference in our powers won't change.
Things won't conveniently go right for me.
I'm blown away, and my enemy comes to smash my head.
I'll lose. I'll lose. I'll lose. I'll lose.
It's a self-evident truth.
But my body still moves!

"Kotomi-"
My enemy looms over me.
My legs don't moveyeah, my right leg really doesn't move at allbut I fire them up to raise my body.

I won't die here.
I can't avoid the enemy's attack with these legs.
In desperation, I try to evade the death coming in the next second and

"ne?"
The guy in front of me didn't make it.
He's standing in front of me with an upraised fist.

"...This is how it ends.  A simple difference in time."
He looks down at his chest.
The black stain is right where his heart should be.
...The difference in time.
So he became half-dead in the forest a bit before I did.

"You win, Emiya Shirou. I don't know how many more seconds that body will last you, but you must hurry if you need to do something."
He's just like before.
He sounds uninterested in anything, just like when I first met him at the church.

"Kotomine."
"You are the last Master.
 Go to the Holy Grail and fulfill your wish."

The last Master.
The words contain deep weight, but the priest still sounds the same.
It's natural.
This man won't change, even on the verge of his death.
He continues to be my despicable enemy.

"Yeah, this is for hurting me so much. I'm going to mercilessly destroy your wish."


Did he smile in his last moment?
On the verge of rusting away, my eyes no longer serve their purpose.
The priest disappears from this world, with no one to bury him.
The last Tiger Dojo was the final one.
Please click and return to the title screen.

Extra stage!

Side A!!

How's everyone doing? Are you dying without mercy?
This is Tiger Dojo Remix that saves you from simple choice mistakes!

Osu! Our battle just started.

Oh, don't say that. We'll get cut off if you say that line.

Well, Sakura-chan's route is about to enter its climax.
You can't be beaten when Tohsaka-san's in a big pinch!

That's right. Shirou can't beat Saber, so trust Rider and concentrate on your part!

Yup. Shirou's role is rearguard support. Watch over the fight from a distance and take the best part!

...But the story's getting really fancy. It's taking place underground, and Sakura-chan powered up a lot.

Oh, where are you going, "Fate"?

Yeah, you're right, master. I thought I could take a big part in this route, but Sakura's my rival.

I wasn't even a match against her, so I'm forced to come back to this dojo.

Ohh, what a tragic story...

So it's true that a bullied child is strong. The Tohsaka sisters are fearsome indeed. So they were both devils...

Yeah. I hate how everyone was putting their masks on.
Saber's gone black and merciless. Rin's cruel now when it counts.

I feel sorry for Shirou. I'm the only heroine that's not a two-faced person.

......Well, you certainly aren't a two-faced person...

Well, let's get on to the usual hint.
Sakura-chan route, "Heavens feel", has two endings.

One is the grand finale, the true ending of "Fate/stay night"!

True and normal ends.

Well, you can easily get to the normal end.
The condition for the true ending depends on what you've done until now.

To come out with it, you can't get to the true end if my affection points are below four or if you've used projection one too many times!

Cheeeeest! Don't spoil!

Ouuuu... Come on, this is the last one, so you should let me!

No! This is the last stronghold in "Fate"!
But we'll tell you up-front.  You can do something about Ilya-chan's affection score if you start over from Day 14!

Hey, you're coming out with it too!

Eh? But this is the Q&A. Our reason for existence is to give out hints.

I see. I don't get how it's different from a spoiler, but you're a tyrant, master.

What, you finally realized it in the 39th dojo!?

Well, the next one will be the final Tiger Dojo.
The long story's finally wrapping up.

The last bad end is rumored to be an erotic harem route, as expected from a mature-rated game!
Please keep your expectations up and keep up your indecisiveness!
Extra stage!

Side B!

Sorry to keep you waiting! Wanting her, her, and everyone else! This the only harem end in "Fate"!

All right! An erotic development that will keep you in animalistic passion for life awaits you

Wait, how is this a harem end!?

......Ouu... So am I stretching it a bit too far, master?

Geez, you can't do anything suspenseful like this!

 I love having monsters you had a hard time killing come back after the ending credits and "fin" come up.

Like the blob.

Oh, Senpai. Long time no see.

Geez. This is all because you were confined by lingering affection.
You can only save one. That's the decision you made coming into the final battle, so stick with it no matter what.

Osu, that's splendid, master.
...But are you sure there's no ending to save Saber?

Play the Saber route.

You're brutally honest, but that's exactly right.

There's no ending in Sakura-chan's route to make Saber-chan happy, so all you Saber-chan supporters can give up.

Well, the Tiger Dojo is really finished.
There're forty dojos total, so thanks for bearing with us.

Wow, there's that many?
What happens if you collect all the stamps, Taiga?

You'll see after you collect them all.
The main story's about to end, so it might be fun to use the skip function and start over if you haven't seen a particular dojo.

Anyway, thanks for playing the game until now!
The main story's about to end, so please keep at it!

Yeah, thank you so much for everything until now! It was fun!
Goodbye! Let's meet again after you fully complete the game!
